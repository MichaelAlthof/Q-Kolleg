Abstract
The present study addresses the economic interpretation of stock market volatility. We argue that its character is inherently ambivalent, being considered as an indicator of either information flow or uncertainty. We discriminate between these views by measuring the fraction of price changes that feeds into other markets depending on the prevailing level of volatility. This exploits the revealed reaction of investors to gauge the degree of information and uncertainty ascribed to volatility. We estimate simultaneous timevarying coefficient models, using data of US and further stock markets. We find the signal of volatility to depend crucially on the combination of its "sender" and "receiver".

1 Introduction
The present study examines the economic interpretation of volatility in financial markets. From our understanding of the academic literature and public debates, volatility plays a role with regard to two different perspectives. On the one hand, the fact that prices vary can be interpreted as a sign of information flow. On the other hand, high variability is often seen as a mirror image of pronounced uncertainty in the market. Both views seem reasonable, and we aim at shedding light on the inherent ambivalence. To that end, we seek to infer a dominating signal of return variability from different reactions of investors to observed returns, depending on the prevailing level of volatility. The analysis is based on daily data of major stock indexes from the Americas, Australia and the Asian region.
Let us first provide some background concerning the two signals of volatility we put up for discussion and review some literature we see connected to our line of reasoning. From one point of view, volatility is often associated with uncertainty or risk. Considering the global financial crisis for instance, future market developments are highly uncertain. In the public discussion, the image of labile and disoriented financial markets prevails. Intuitively, the extensive stock market volatility is often interpreted as the reflection of this uncertainty. In the present study this concept of volatility shall be summarized as the uncertainty hypothesis.
Regarding the pricing of assets, it seems natural that investors expect to be compensated for bearing uncertainty in their portfolios. In fact, in academia the understanding of volatility as risk long plays an important role with a prominent example given by the !-m -utility function and the CAPM. Originating from Engle et al. (1987), financial econometricians translated this idea into the variance-in-mean model (see also Bali and Engle 2010 and the references therein). Another example for volatility proxying uncertainty is given by interactions between output or inflation uncertainty and the conditional means of these variables (e.g. Grier and Perry 2000). In a further strand of literature, numerous studies analyze how uncertainty about exchange rate movements affects trade volume and foreign direct investment, e.g. Cushman (1985), Chowdhury (1993) and Kiyota and Urata (2004). For instance, volatility might negatively impact the size of trade flows if exchange rate uncertainty renders trade less profitable for risk averse agents.
On the other hand, we will refer to the view of volatility being a measure of information flow intensity as the information hypothesis. Some representatives of the literature who elaborate on the volatility-information link are Clark (1973), Epps and Epps (1976) and Ross (1989). Overall, the idea is that no motivation for further trading would exist in
1

a situation where all prices have settled at their equilibrium values. Thus, volatility would be zero in absence of relevant news. If, however, additional information becomes available, price adjustments will generate fluctuations until a new equilibrium is reached. Of course, in reality, shocks are too frequent to allow conventional asset prices to ever settle at some constant consensus value, and perception and handling of information both represent more complicated processes than assumed in stylized model economies. Nonetheless, the line of reasoning exemplifies how volatility is connected to information arrival.
The information content of price movements is normally not observable. This is likely to be one of the main reasons why information flow was connected to volatility in the first place. By the same token, a strand of literature examined trading volume as an observable variable that is at least partly driven by the information arrival process; see Tauchen and Pitts (1983), Harris (1987), Lamoureux and Lastrapes (1990) and Foster and Viswanathan (1993, 1995). Certainly, volume cannot explain volatility, in the sense of an exogenous variable. Instead, both are affected simultaneously by the latent information process. Moreover, many trades are unlikely to be linked to information arrival, such as in the cases of liquidity management (e.g. Andersen 1996), strategic trading under asymmetric information (e.g. Kyle 1985) or differences of opinions on the interpretation of signals (e.g. Kim and Verrecchia 1991). Attempts have been made to proxy information arrival directly by, for example, central bank decisions, macroeconomic news or firm-specific announcements. For studies of corresponding volatility effects, see e.g. Andersen and Bollerslev (1998) or Kalev et al. (2004). Nonetheless, even if important insights into news effects could be gained, such direct observable measures cannot represent more than a fraction of the universe of information arriving in financial markets. Above all, they hardly capture private information, which is a major factor behind volatility (French and Roll 1986).
Our distinct hypotheses serve to fix ideas concerning the character of volatility. Naturally, they are not mutually exclusive. Rather, exploring the "signal of volatility" amounts to asking which effect predominates. In fact, this calls for a mechanism connecting the latent variables information and uncertainty to a measure that is estimable from the data. In the present approach, we propose letting the reaction of market participants decide the character of volatility instead of leaving this task up to the econometrician. Specifically, we make use of the intensity by which shocks feed into actual market prices, thereby connecting a high intensity to high information content, as further explained below. However, given a single observed time series, identifying the size of the shocks
2

themselves (i.e., volatility) and the size of their impact on the price separately, proves evidently impossible.
We approach this problem by extending the information set to the multivariate case. In particular, we examine the intensity of spillover between two different markets. Logically, while shocks can be identified in the "source" market, transmission intensity is measured in the "target" market. In case observed price changes in the source market are interpreted as highly informative (uncertain) signals by the target market, the latter will incorporate a relatively large (small) fraction of the innovation into its own price. We illustrate this principle in a stylized model economy, based on signal extraction by rational agents. Overall, high volatility in the target market associated with high spillover intensity would support the information hypothesis, while evidence for the uncertainty hypothesis would follow from an inverse linkage.
Econometrically, we measure this nonlinear effect in a time-varying coefficient model governed by the (autoregressive) conditional variance of the source market, i.e., we utilize time variation in volatility to identify its impact on transmission intensity. This concept does not aim at explaining the mere fact that markets are interconnected, e.g. by trade, policy coordination or common shocks. Rather, we exploit the existing interaction for estimating the spillover intensity and its link to volatility. Furthermore, the a priori division into "source" and "target" markets is an artificial one. In reality, once one introduces spillover effects, one must take a stance on how to resolve endogeneity. Our model set-up will generally allow for bi-directional transmission between the US and the second country of interest. Identification is achieved as in Weber (2010), who exploits the fact that simultaneous systems become unique in the presence of heteroskedasticity (see Sentana and Fiorentini 2001, and Rigobon 2003). Therefore, both the direction and the size of spillovers can be determined empirically. These considerations on simultaneity apply to markets with overlapping trading hours, like in the Americas. For models of the US and the major Asian or Australian stock indexes, the spillover direction is given by the sequence of time, since these markets trade with substantial time shifts. Consequently, identification problems are alleviated in this setting.
Our major result tells us that the information content of volatility crucially depends on the combination of "sender" and "receiver" of volatility signals. For industrialized countries, the information hypothesis holds. As for emerging economies, however, the uncertainty hypothesis prevails in their relations to the US.
The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. The next section presents a stylized model of stock market returns and derives the testable hypotheses. Section 3 introduces the econo-
3

metric model and discusses identification issues and the estimation procedure. Section 4 applies the methodology to daily returns of major stock indexes from the Americas, Australia and the Asian region. The last section concludes.

2 Volatility Signals in a Stylized Model Economy

2.1 The Market Participant: Signal Extraction Problem
First we illustrate the idea of the signal of volatility in a stylized model economy. This should help fix ideas on how stock market interaction could depend on return variability. Moreover, the nature of this interdependence should reveal the character of volatility, i.e., it should indicate whether volatility in one market means information or uncertainty (noise) to the other. A prominent model from the literature, which can be used for this purpose, was considered by King and Wadhwani (1990). We adopt this framework to demonstrate that in a signal extraction context, the prevailing character of volatility can be identified from the optimal reaction of investors to observed returns.
For the present purpose, it is sufficient to consider two stock markets where price changes are associated with the arrival of relevant information and with noise, i.e., uncertainty. The first consists two parts: directly observed information and a reaction to information that is not fully observed in that market but only in the other:

y1t = f1t + _21E[f2t |I1t ] + i1t

(1)

y2t = _12E[f1t |I2t ] + f2t + i2t .

(2)

Stock returns are given by yt, information is denoted by ft, it refers to noise and E[∑|Ijt] represents the expectations operator conditional on the information observed in market j at time t.
When investors form expectations, say in market 1, they face a simple signal extraction problem, since all they can observe from market 2 is the contemporaneous price change. In order to extract the signal from the part of the price movement in market 2 that is not simply due to information in market 1, agents in market 1 have to find `1 in

E[f2t |I1t ] = `1(y2t - _12E[f1t |I2t ]) .

(3)

4

The solution to (3) is given by the minimum-variance estimator:

`1

=

Var[f2t ] Var[f2t ] + Var[i2t ]

.

(4)

Evidently, `1 becomes time varying, i.e., `1t, in case volatility of either f2t or i2t changes over time.

Of course, agents in market 2 follow an analogous rationale. Using (3) and (4) to substitute for the conditional expectations in (1) and (2) yields the following simultaneous equations system of stock returns:

y1t = A12t y2t + °1t

(5)

y2t = A21t y1t + °2t ,

(6)

where the spillover coefficients are given by A12t = _12`1t and A21t = _21`2t. The shocks result as °1t = (1 - _12_21`1t `2t )(f1t + i1t ) and °2t = (1 - _12_21`1t `2t )(f2t + i2t ).
In our application, we will choose the US as the first country and switch between several other stock markets in y2. Logically, the model will change according to the choice of the second country. In addition to the second equation, this concerns also (1). Apart from the spillover, the partitioning of the return shock into information and noise, and thus also ` and A, depend on the perspective of the second country. In order to keep the notation simple, we write down model (1)-(2) only for a given set of countries.

2.2 The Econometrician: Testable Hypotheses
Following the reasoning from above, the contemporaneous impact from one market to the other depends on the variances of both signal (information) and noise (uncertainty). However, assuming the model in (5) and (6) is identified, the econometrician can only estimate the variance of °t . Taking the typical time-varying nature of financial time series volatility into account, we denote the conditional variance of °t by Var[°t|It-1] = ht and let the spillover coefficients depend on the variances by

Ai jt = fi j(h jt ) i, j = 1, 2 and i = j .

(7)

(4),

hypothesis.

The exact functional form of f (∑) is not clear, the more so the _i j from (1) and (2) might also vary over time. As discussed in detail in the next section, we approximate f (∑) on an empirical basis. So far, we summarize the following two testable hypotheses:

Information Hypothesis:

The spillover intensity Ai jt in (5) and (6) depends positively on the level of volatility in

the

market,

i.e.,

, Ai jt , h jt

> 0.

Uncertainty Hypothesis:

The spillover intensity Ai jt in (5) and (6) depends negatively on the level of volatility in

the

other

market,

i.e.,

, Ai jt , h jt

<0

.

3 Empirical Approach: Measuring Investors Reaction to Observed Returns

3.1 Simultaneous Model and Identification
In order to explore the signal of volatility, we first discuss our simultaneous model setup. The considered stock returns are collected in the n-dimensional vector yt . The data generating process is approximated by the following simultaneous system:

Ayt = !t + °t ,

(8)

where !t represents a vector of predictable components such as lags or a constant term and °t is a n-dimensional vector of structural innovations. The contemporaneous impacts are included in matrix A with diagonal elements normalized to one. It is these effects that model the spillovers between returns in the current setting and that we will allow to depend on volatility later on. Common shocks will be accommodated by allowing for correlation of °t, as explained below.
The simultaneous specification (8) is not meant to take a stance on fundamental causality, in the sense that an impulse say in market j is necessarily the true causal origin of a spillover to market i. Of course, one can think of idiosyncratic events in market j affecting market i, based on economic linkages or psychological effects. However, an impulse in

6

market j may well be initiated by some information that is equally relevant for market i, where investors observe the signal from j. Then it would evidently be the third-party origin of the information, and not market j itself, which would underlie the impact on market i. In summary, spillovers characterize signals in one stock index that are incorporated by other markets, but not necessarily based on actual bivariate causality.

Statistically, model (8) as it stands is not identified: In the matrix A with a normalized diagonal, n(n - 1) simultaneous impacts have to be estimated, whereas the covariance matrix of the reduced-form residuals A-1°t delivers only n(n - 1)/2 determining equations due to its symmetry. However, as for instance Sentana and Fiorentini (2001) and Rigobon (2003) show, unobservable factor structures like (8) become unique if heteroskedasticity is present in the stochastic components. The idea is that, although breaks in the structural variances introduce additional unknowns (i.e., the variances in the new regime), they shift the whole covariance matrix in the reduced form, from which available information (i.e., variances and covariances) is doubled. Time-varying volatility is a common feature of financial variables, often modeled as ARCH-type processes. Indeed, the approach of Sentana and Fiorentini (2001) subsumes the case of regime switches just as other forms of heteroskedasticity such as ARCH. Here, we follow Weber (2010), who specifies multivariate EGARCH processes for the structural shocks.

Formalizing the model setup, first denote the conditional variances of the elements in °t by

Var(° jt |1t-1) = h2jt

j = 1, . . . , n ,

(9)

where 1t-1 stands for the whole set of available information at time t - 1. Furthermore, denote the standardized innovations by

°~ jt = ° jt /h jt

j = 1, . . . , n .

EGARCH(1,1)-processes are then given by

(10)

log h2jt = c j + g j log h2jt-1 + d j(|°~ jt-1| - 2//) + f j°~ jt-1

j = 1, . . . , n , (11)

where c j, g j, d j and f j represent the coefficients. The term 2// serves to demean the absolute shock. In addition, going beyond the pure magnitude of shocks, the signed °~t introduce asymmetric volatility effects. The logarithmic formulation ensures positive variances without relying on parametric restrictions.
Common shocks are taken into account via the structural constant conditional correla-

7

tion (SCCC) approach of Weber (2010). The advantage of the SCCC model is to relax the uncorrelatedness assumption for structural shocks on the one hand but to keep up the identification of the simultaneous model achieved through heteroskedasticity on the other. The covariances of structural shocks are recovered by the CCC specification

Cov(°it , ° jt |It-1) = hi jt = li jhit h jt i = j ,

(12)

where li j denotes the correlation between the ith and the jth innovation.4 This correlation can be thought of as arising from the exposure of variables i and j to unobserved common factors.
For markets with non-overlapping trading hours identification problems are alleviated. Naturally, a triangular coefficient matrix At can be used. Even though the index t then does not refer to the same time for all variables, we keep the notation for simplicity purposes.

3.2 Time-Varying Coefficients
Up to this point, the off-diagonal elements of matrix A in (8) imply spillovers between the endogenous variables that are proportional to the size of shocks with proportionality factors constant over time. While this represents the standard in simultaneous systems, the current research question requires a more complex specification. In order to discriminate between the information and uncertainty hypotheses, we allow the transmission intensity to depend on source market volatility as derived in section 2.2.
Strictly speaking, A is substituted by At in (8). The elements Ai jt, i = j, denote the coefficients of transmission from variable j to i at time t. As a parsimonious functional form, consider the linear specification of (7):

Ai jt = ai j + bi jh jt ,

(13)

for all i, j. Here, the conditional standard deviation hjt serves as the transition variable. Since At stands on the left hand side, negative values represent positive transmission. Therefore, ai j is expected to be smaller than zero. Accordingly, a one-unit increase in source market volatility decreases spillover intensity by bi j. Hence, from the above discussion it follows that bi j < 0 would favor the information hypothesis, whereas prevalence
4We also considered the structural dynamic conditional correlation (SDCC) approach. However, empirical evidence was in favor of the SCCC model.

8

of the uncertainty hypothesis requires bi j > 0. Alternatively, bi j = 0 would bring us back to the case of constant parameters.

We note that this specification can be compared to the GARCH-in-mean model, where returns are explained by their own conditional variances. In our approach, the variance series is also employed for an interaction effect with the level. However, we allow the spillover in one mean equation to depend on the conditional variance of another return.

No case can be made, a priori, that the transition function (13), i.e., the volatility effect on spillover intensity, is necessarily linear. While the advantage lies in parametric parsimony, the exact functional form of (7) should be determined on an empirical basis. For instance, let us assume a situation with a < 0 and evidence for the uncertainty hypothesis, say b > 0. At a certain point, a linear transition function could approach a negative correlation between markets (i.e., with a positive left-hand-side coefficient). Since such a constellation appears rather implausible, the transition effect is likely to exhibit dampening non-linearity for high volatility values. Still, if such realizations are rare in the sample, (13) might work well as approximation of the transition function (7).

As an alternative specification, literature on smooth transition regression (STR) (e.g. Luukkonen et al. 1988) has adopted flexible functions to grasp time variation in coefficients. Specifically, consider

Ai jt = ai j + _i j/(1 + e-aij(hjt -`ij)) .

(14)

The exact form of the transition is determined by the logistic function (1 + e-a(h-`))-1, which is monotonically increasing5 in h jt and bounded between zero and one. The slope parameter a indicates the speed or smoothness of transition: as a  ', the logistic function approaches the indicator function I(h jt > c), i.e., a single threshold. In contrast, a = 0 simply gives the linear case. The parameter ` represents the location of the transition. In sum, the STR-based specification lets the data decide about the shape of the volatility effect on spillover size.
Nonlinear functional forms are one way of dealing with large realizations of the conditional standard deviation. Another straightforward option is given by transforming the transition variable. While we use the standard deviation, taking logarithms as in (11), for instance, would further dampen extreme volatility spikes. While there is little reason to believe that a "correct" option could be chosen on theoretical grounds, our results proved robust in this respect.
5We think of volatility effects on transmission strength being monotonous, even if they are not necessarily linear. More involved STR functions should thus not be required.

9

A last comment concerns the testing of statistical significance of the transition variables in the STR setup. Luukkonen et al. (1988) show that straightforward hypotheses like _i j = 0 or ai j = 0 are inappropriate because of the presence of unidentified nuisance parameters under the null. Instead, for testing purposes the functions are approximated by a Taylor series of a higher order, usually of order three:

Ai jt = ai j + bi j,1h jt + bi j,2h2jt + bi j,3h3jt .

(15)

Here, standard likelihood ratio (LR) principles apply to the hypothesis bi j,1 = bi j,2 = bi j,3 = 0. Of course, linearization may adversely affect the power of the test. However, as Skalin (1998) points out, simulation-based techniques would be extremely computationally demanding and bootstrapping does not provide superior size and power properties. Therefore, we will rely on the LR test in the transition model (15). Furthermore, if bi j,2 = bi j,3 = 0 but bi j,1 = 0 is found, the transition function can be approximated by the linear specification (13). Estimation is based on (quasi) maximum likelihood.

4 Application: The Signal of International Stock Market Volatility
4.1 Data
We examine a balanced sample from 1/1/1988 to 12/31/2010 of daily returns on major stock indices from the US (S&P 500) and a second country of interest. From the Americas we choose Canada (S&P/TSX 60), Argentina (TOTMKAR6), Brazil (Bovespa Index) and Mexico (IPC) as examples for contemporaneous trading. The markets of Australia (S&P/ASX 50), Japan (Nikkei), Hong Kong (HSI), Korea (KOSPI ) and Taiwan (TAIEX) are all located overseas from the US and represent markets with nonoverlapping trading hours. Stock returns are depicted in Figure 1. The time variation in volatility appears very pronounced in all series. This is also statistically indicated by significant autocorrelation of squared returns found in preliminary data inspection. The presence of heteroskedasticity is of special importance to our approach, as it allows estimation of volatility effects on spillover intensity.
6Due to data availability for Argentina we use the TOTMKAR provided by Datastream instead of the MERVAL, see http://product.datastream.com/navigator/HelpFiles/DatatypeDefi nitions/en/3/DSGI total market data.htm.

4.2 Specification Tests
The set of equations to be estimated consists of bivariate simultaneous models with conditional heteroskedasticity for the US and a second country of interest. The empirical application starts with specifying the functional form of the transition function by means of likelihood ratio tests. The specification test procedure can be described as follows:
Since stock market trading hours in Canada and the US are exactly the same and those in Argentina, Brazil and Mexico largely coincide with the US, we allow for bi-directional simultaneous effects. Identification is achieved through the SCCC approach. For theses markets, the null of linear spillover in both directions is tested separately against the alternative of nonlinear (STR) spillover. In view of the third order Taylor approximation this translates into testing two linear restrictions in (15) for each case: H0: b12,2 = b12,3 = 0 and H0: b21,2 = b21,3 = 0, respectively. In cases where the null of linear spillover in at least one direction cannot be rejected, we additionally test against constant spillover. For the concerned markets (Australia, Canada, Mexico) evidence was in favor of time-varying coefficients. Columns 2 and 3 of Table 1 include p-values of LR specification tests corresponding to the null given in the first row. Bold numbers reflect rejection of the respective null. Column 4 shows the final model specification.7
In the Asian region and Australia, stock markets open after those in the US have closed so that identification issues are alleviated due to this chronology. Hence, we only test for the functional form of the transition function in one direction. For Japan, Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan, we additionally present test results for the null of constant against linear spillover in column 3, as no evidence for nonlinear effects could be found.
During estimation we set !t constant, as autocorrelation of returns is mostly very close to zero. Results turn out to be insensitive to the inclusion of lagged terms in (8). Furthermore, standardized squared residuals appear free from autocorrelation. Thus, we can be confident that our parsimonious EGARCH(1,1) specification is sufficient to capture the time variation in the volatility series.
7In two cases we do not follow the outcome of the specification tests, namely the Argentinian and Brazilian spillover on the US. Even though statistically nonlinear effects are indicated by the p-values, we restrict the spillover to zero. A closer analysis of these two cases revealed that the smooth transition function actually serves as a dummy to capture only very few outliers at the beginning of our sample while the spillover on the US is otherwise constant and close to zero (between 1% and 2%).

4.3 Results
The first major result is that we find evidence for time-varying spillover coefficients in all non-Asian countries. In particular, LR tests (not presented in Table 1) of constant against linearly time-varying spillover result in p-values of 0.000 (Canada), 0.081 (Australia), 0.031 (Mexico), 0.000 (Argentina), and 0.004 (Brazil). That is, for all these countries test results suggest the rejection of constant parameters. Estimated coefficients are presented in columns 5 to 8 of Table 1. The hypothesis favored by our evidence is listed in the last column. The results for the Americas and Australia can be divided into two groups. First, the information hypothesis prevails in Australia and Canada as US volatility increases the fraction of US shocks that feed into the prices of Australian and Canadian stocks. The same holds for Canadian volatility, signaling information for US traders. Second, Argentinian, Brazilian and Mexican stock markets seem to understand US volatility as uncertainty since higher volatility leads to a reduction of spillover intensity in these markets. Considering the opposite direction, we find the information hypothesis to dominate in the US with respect to Mexican volatility. However, the small effect from Mexico on the US is economically of minor importance. The transition functions of these markets are plotted in Figures 3 to 6 (right hand side) together with the spillover intensities (left hand side). We obtain the following results.
Evidence for the Information Hypotheses in Industrialized Economies
- In Canada, the effect of US volatility is quite pronounced, indicated by a steep transition function. This results in a transmission that varies between 10% in times of low and approximately 30% in times of high volatility.
- The information signaling effect of Canadian volatility is also substantial. It produces an even higher spillover variation on the US but, of course, with a lower mean.
- In Australia the information signaling US volatility leads to spillover intensity between roughly 36% and 43%. The spike towards the end of the sample resulting from high US volatility during the crisis drives up transmission strength to 50%.
Evidence for the Uncertainty Hypotheses in Emerging Economies
- The transition functions and spillover intensity for Argentina and Brazil are of similar shape. In Argentina, however, transmission strength varies around a lower level (70%)
14

than in Brazil (80%). US volatility strongly reduces spillover intensity and is thus interpreted as signaling uncertainty. In both cases, the variance of domestic shocks is high compared to the US, and also to Australia and Canada. Thus, despite high spillover, domestic shocks represent a major factor of return variation in Argentina and Brazil.
- Analogously, transmission strength takes values between 60% and 76% in Mexico with an average of 73% and US volatility having a negative impact. On the contrary, in the US, Mexican volatility increases spillover. Yet, economically the effect fluctuating between zero and a few percent appears to be of secondary importance.
Constant Coefficients for Japan and the Asian "Tigers"
With regard to the Asian region, we find constant spillover in all four cases (Table 1 lower panel). In light of the present research question this result is taken as evidence that neither information nor uncertainty exhibits a dominating effect. Compared to the other estimates, spillover from the US on Korea of 17%, on Japan 16%, on Hong Kong 15% and on Taiwan 10% are of medium size, see Figure 7.

Interpreting the Stock Market Evidence
Returning to the discussion at the beginning of the paper, the answer to the question whether volatility predominantly signals information or uncertainty is - literally - in the eye of the beholder. On the one hand, identifying shocks in the "source" market and measuring their impact on transmission intensity in the "target" market renders identification and estimation possible. On the other hand, this implies one particular combination of "sender" and "receiver" of volatility signals in each model. The differences in the results across countries show that this combination is crucial. The generally high level of US spillover on the countries under investigation indicates the important role of US stock market developments as a major point of reference. However, even though the "sender of volatility" remains the same in all cases, in times of high volatility this importance decreases for some "receivers", whereas for others it increases.
An intuition for these results might be found in the interconnection and commonalities of each country and the US. Specifically, factors such as trade, policy coordination or institutional similarities might be one reason for the industrialized countries Australia and Canada to predominantly identify information from stock market fluctuations in the US. The US signal bears highly relevant and well-understood information that outweighs the uncertainty, and, is priced instantaneously. By contrast, the reduction of spillover intensity to the emerging economies Argentina, Brazil and Mexico in times of rising US volatility may be explained in the light of dissimilarities, for instance, in the institutional, legal and regulatory framework and relative political and economic instability. The information content in US price changes becomes less visible during turbulent times, which are perceived as propagating uncertainty instead. Japan and the Asian "Tigers"
18

Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan might, to some degree, be classified between emerging and the Western industrialized countries with respect to commonalities with the US as, for instance, economic, political and institutional aspects. Accordingly, the information content and the uncertainty of US volatility appear to compensate each other.
4.4 Crisis, Correlation and Coefficients
During turbulent times, such as the ongoing global financial crisis, stock market comovement is commonly perceived to be more pronounced. Indeed, splitting the present sample in a pre- and post-Lehman period with break date 9/15/2008 reveals a substantial increase in the empirical return correlation between each country and the US. Yet, at the same time, our previous results showed decreasing spillover intensity in some markets (Argentina, Brazil and Mexico). Even though we already specified a time varying coefficient model, these findings suggest that the volatility effect on the transmission strength might exhibit a structural break. So far, our approach implicitly assumed that either the information or the uncertainty hypotheses predominates over the whole sample period. Therefore, we pursue this issue further with emphasis on a pre-crisis and a crisis sample.
It is also well known, however, that a rise in correlation between two variables might very well simply be triggered by an increased variance of the explanatory variable. Forbes and Rigobon (2002), for instance, document this crucial role of volatility changes that can result in biased estimates of correlation coefficients. For the present data we evaluated this effect in a small simulation study. Denoting US returns by xt and those of the other country by yt , we simulated yt = ` xt + °t for the pre- and post-Lehman period with parameters according to our empirical estimates from the above models. Thereby, the following rule of thumb was used: We set ` to the average spillover intensity and drew °t and xt from normal distributions with zero mean and Var(°t ) and Var(xt ) equal to the average ARCH variances - before and after 9/15/2008, respectively.
With this parametrization we were able to reproduce the sharp rise in return correlation during the crisis period. Thus, the increasing US volatility turned out to be the major driving force behind the rising correlations with Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. At the same time, this implies that the transition functions with stable parameters are compatible with the data. Despite the increase in return correlations, our approach is able to identify what we have termed the uncertainty effect, i.e., spillover strength decreases in volatility. The reason is that the variance changes, which affect the correlation coefficients, are explicitly taken into account in our model.

5 Conclusion
In the present study we analyze the character of financial volatility, which we argue is inherently ambivalent. Regarding the academic literature, volatility is used to proxy two different latent variables: information and uncertainty. We summarize the first view as the information hypothesis referring to studies where volatility is directly related to information flow intensity (see e.g. Ross 1989, Foster and Viswanathan 1993, 1995 or Kalev et al. 2004). The uncertainty hypothesis, on the other hand, has its source in large strands of literature where volatility is functioning as an uncertainty-proxy (see e.g Engle et al. 1987, Grier and Perry 2000, Chowdhury 1993 or Kiyota and Urata 2004). In order to examine the signal of volatility, we propose an econometric approach that consists of a simultaneous equations model with time-varying parameters. The timevariation of the spillover coefficient in one market is driven by the volatility of the other. In this setting it is the effect of volatility on the spillover strength that reflects whether the information hypothesis (positive effect) or the uncertainty hypothesis (negative effect) dominates. In that sense, we let the data decide which signal emerges from volatility. Evidence for the information hypothesis is found for Australia and Canada, whereas the data of Argentina, Brazil and Mexico support the uncertainty hypothesis. Moreover, our estimates and specification tests for the Asian markets (Japan, Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan) are in favor of constant coefficients, indicating that the uncertainty and the information content of US stock market volatility balance each other out. This paper reveals that the signal attributed to foreign stock market volatility differs substantially across countries. A natural extension would be given by the analysis of other assets like bonds concerning the role of volatility. Moreover, apart from foreign volatility, a thorough examination of volatility-driven spillover between particular parts of one stock market, e.g. blue chips (Dow) vs. high tech (Nasdaq), can provide deeper insights into the signal of volatility. Further investigation along these lines represents an promising path for future research.
