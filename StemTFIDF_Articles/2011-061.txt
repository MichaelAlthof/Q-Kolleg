Forward-backward systems for expected utility maximization
Ulrich Horst, Ying Hu, Peter Imkeller, Anthony R´eveillac§and Jianing Zhang¶ October 4, 2011

Abstract
In this paper we deal with the utility maximization problem with a general utility function. We derive a new approach in which we reduce the utility maximization problem with general utility to the study of a fully-coupled Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equation (FBSDE).

1 Introduction

One of the most commonly studied topic in mathematical finance (and applied probably) is the problem of maximizing expected terminal utility from trading in a financial market. In such a situation, the stochastic control problem is of the form

V (0, x) := sup E[U (XT + H)]
A

(1.1)

for a real-valued function U , where A denotes the set of admissible trading strategies, T < 

is the terminal time, XT is the wealth of the agent when he follows the strategy   A and his initial capital at the initial time zero is x > 0, and H is a liability that the agent must deliver

at the terminal time. One is typically interested in establishing existence and uniqueness

of optimal solutions and in characterizing optimal strategies and the value function V (t, x)

which is defined as

V (t, x) := sup E[U (Xt,T + H)|Ft].

Here Xt,T denotes the wealth of the agent when the investment period is [t, T ] and where the filtration (Ft)t[0,T ] defines the flow of information.
The question of existence of an optimal strategy  can essentially be addressed using convex duality. The convex duality approach is originally due to Bismut [2] with its modern form dating back to Kramkov and Schachermayer [13]. For instance, given some growth condition on U or related quantities (such as the asymptotic elasticity condition for utilities defined on the half line) existence of an optimal strategy is guaranteed under mild regularity conditions on the liability and convexity assumptions on the set of admissible trading strategies (see e.g. [1] for details). However, the duality method is not constructive and does not allow for a characterization of optimal strategies and value functions.

One approach to simultaneously characterize optimal trading strategies and utilities uses the

theory of forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDE). When the filtration

is generated by a standard Wiener process W and if either U (x) := - exp(-x) for some

and

L2,

or

U (x)

and

H

0,

it

has

been shown

by Hu, Imkeller and Mu¨ller [9] that the control problem (1.1) can essentially be reduced to

solving a BSDE of the form

TT
Yt = H - ZsdWs - f (s, Zs)ds, t  [0, T ],
tt

(1.2)

where the driver f (t, z) is a predictable process of quadratic growth in the z-variable. Their results have since been extended beyond the Brownian framework and to more general utility optimization problems with complete and incomplete information in, e.g., [8], [19], [20], [21] and [17]. The method used in [9] and essentially all other papers relies on the martingale optimality principle and can essentially only be applied to the standard cases mentioned above (exponential with general endowment and power, respectively logarithmic, with zero endowment). This is due to a particular "separation of variables" property enjoyed by the classical utility functions: their value function can be decomposed as V (t, x) = g(x)Vt where g is a deterministic function and V is an adapted process. As a result, optimal future trading strategies are independent of current wealth levels.
More generally, there has recently been an increasing interest in dynamic translation invariant utility functions. A utility function is called translation invariant if a cash amount added to a financial position increases the utility by that amount and hence optimal trading strategies are wealth-independent1. Although the property of translation invariance renders the utility optimization problem mathematically tractable, independence of the trading strategies on wealth is rather unsatisfactory from an economic point of view. In [18] the authors derive a verification theorem for optimal trading strategies for more general utility functions when H = 0. More precisely, given a general utility function U and assuming that there exists an optimal strategy regular enough such that the value function enjoys some regularity properties in (t, x), it is shown that there exists a predictable random field ((t, x))(t,x)[0,T ]×(0,) such that the pair (V, ) is solution to the following backward

stochastic partial differential equation (BSPDE) of the form:

V (t, x) = U (x) -

T
(s, x)dWs -
t

T |x(s, x)|2 ds, t Vxx(s, x)

t  [0, T ]

(1.3)

where x denotes the partial derivative of  with respect to x and Vxx the second partial derivative of V with respect to the same variable. The optimal strategy  can then be obtained from (V, ). Unfortunately, the BSPDE-theory is still in its infancy and to the best of our knowledge the non-linearities arising in (1.3) cannot be handled except in the classical cases mentioned above where once again one benefits of the "separation of variables" (see [11]). Moreover, the utility function U only appears in the terminal condition which is not very handy. In that sense this is exactly the same situation as the Hamilton-JacobiBellman equation where U only appears as a terminal condition but not in the equation itself.

In this paper we propose a new approach to solving the optimization problem (1.1) for a larger class of utility function and characterize the optimal strategy  in terms of a fully-coupled FBSDE-system. The optimal strategy is then a function of the current wealth and of the solution to the backward component of the system. In addition, the driver of the backward part is given in terms of the utility function and its derivatives. This adds enough structure to the optimization problem to deal with fairly general utilities functions, at least when the market is complete. We also derive the FBSDE system for the power case with general (non-hedgeable) liabilities; to the best of our knowledge we are the first to characterize optimal strategies for power utilities with general liabilities. Finally, we link our approach to the well established approaches using convex dual theory and stochastic maximum principles.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce our financial market model. In Section 3 we first derive a verification theorem in terms of a FBSDE for utilities defined on the real line along with a converse result, that is, we show that a solution to the FBSDE allows to construct the optimal strategy. Section 4 is devoted to the same question but for utilities defined on the positive half line. In Section 5 we relate our approach to the stochastic maximum principle obtained by Peng [22] and the standard duality approach. We use the duality-BSDE link to show that the FBSDE associated with the problem of maximizing power utility with general positive endowment has a solution.

2 Preliminaries
We consider a financial market which consists of one bond S0 with interest rate zero and of d  1 stocks given by
dS~ti := S~tidWti + S~titidt, i  {1, . . . , d}
where W is a standard Brownian motion on Rd defined on a filtered probability space (, F , (Ft)t[0,T ], P), (Ft)t[0,T ] is the filtration generated by W , and  := (1, . . . , d) is a predictable bounded process with values in Rd. Since we assume the process  to be bounded, Girsanov's theorem implies that the set of equivalent local martingale measures

3

(i.e. probability measures under which S~ is a local martingale) is not empty, and thus according to the classical literature (see e.g. [7]), arbitrage opportunities are excluded in our model. For simplicity throughout we write

dSti

:=

dS~ti S~ti

.

We denote by · the inner product in Rd of vectors  and  and by |·| the usual associated L2-norm on Rd. In all the paper C will denote a generic constant which can differ from line
to line. We also define the following spaces:

S2(Rd) :=  :  × [0, T ]  Rd, predictable, E[ sup |t|2] <  ,
t[0,T ]

T

H2(Rd) :=  :  × [0, T ]  Rd, predictable, E

|t|2dt <  .

Since the market price of risk  is assumed to be bounded, the stochastic process

has finite moments of order p for any p > 0. We assume d1 + d2 = d and that the agent can invest in the assets S~1, . . . , S~d1 while the stocks S~d1+1, . . . , S~d2 cannot be in-
vested into. Denote SH := (S1, . . . , Sd1, 0 . . . , 0), W H := (W 1, . . . , W d1, 0 . . . , 0), W O :=
(0, . . . , 0, W d1+1, . . . , W d2), and H := (1, . . . , d1, 0 . . . , 0) (the notation H refers to "hedge-
able" and O to "orthogonal"). We define the set x of admissible strategies with initial

capital x > 0 as

T

x :=  :  × [0, T ]  Rd1, E

|t|2dt < ,  is self-financing

0

where for  in x the associated wealth process X is defined as

(2.1)

Xt := x + rdSrH = x +

ri dSri ,

0 i=1 0

Every  in x is extended to an Rd-valued process by

t  [0, T ].

~ := (1, . . . , d1, 0, . . . , 0).

In the following, we will always write  in place of ~, i.e.  is an Rd-valued process where the last d2 components are zero. Moreover, we consider a utility function U : I  R where I is an interval of R such that U is strictly increasing and strictly concave. We seek for a strategy  in x satisfying E[U (XT + H)] <  such that

 = argmaxx, E[|U(XT+H)|]< {E[U (XT + H)]}

(2.2)

where H is a random variable in L2(, FT , P) such that the expression above makes sense. We concretize on sufficient conditions in the subsequent sections.

3 Utilities defined on the real line

In this section we consider a utility function U : R  R defined on the whole real line. We
assume that U is strictly increasing and strictly concave and that the agent is endowed with a claim H  L2(, FT , P). We introduce the following conditions.

(H1) U : R  R is three times differentiable

(H2) We say that condition (H2) holds for an element  in x, if E[|U (XT + H)|2] <  and if for every bounded predictable process h : [0, T ]  R, the family of random variables

T1

is uniformly integrable.

Before presenting the first main result of this section, we prove that condition (H2) is satisfied for every strategy  such that E[|U (XT + H)|] <  when one has an exponential
growth condition on the marginal utility of the form:

U (x + y)  C 1 + U (x) (1 + exp(y)) for some   R.

Indeed, let G :=

3.1 Characterization and verification: incomplete markets

We are now ready to state and prove the first main result of this paper: a verification theorem for optimal trading strategies.

Theorem 3.1. Assume that (H1) holds. Let   x be an optimal solution to the problem (2.2) which satisfies assumption (H2). Then there exists a predictable process Y with YT = H such that U (X + Y ) is a martingale in L2(, FT , P) and

we have

Now by putting Zi := Z~i - i, i = 1, . . . , d, we have shown that Y is a solution to the

Finally, by construction we have U (Xt + Yt) = t, thus it is a martingale.

(3.4)

Now we deal with the characterization of the optimal strategy. To this end, let h : [0, T ]  Rd1 be a bounded predictable process. We extend h into Rd by setting h~ := (h1, . . . , hd1, 0, . . . , 0) and use the convention that h~ is again denoted by h. Thus for every  in (0, 1) the perturbed strategy  + h belongs to x. Since  is optimal it is clear that
for every such h it holds that

Now using (H2), Lebesgue's dominated convergence theorem implies that (3.5) can be rewrit-

for every bounded predictable process h. Applying integration by parts to U (Xs +Ys)s[0,T ]

(3.7)

The next step would be to apply the conditional expectations in (3.7), however the two terms on the second line of the right hand side are a priori only local martingales. We start by showing that the first one is a uniformly integrable martingale. Indeed, from the computations which have led to (3.3) we have that

U (X + Y )( + Z) = ,

where we recall that  is the square integrable process appearing in (3.2). Using the BDG inequality we get

Indeed

Similarly,

Taking expectation in (3.7) we obtain for every n  1 that

which in conjunction with (3.6) leads to

E U (Xs + Ys)s + U (Xs + Ys)(s + Zs) · hsds  0
0
for every bounded predictable process h. Replacing h by -h, we get

T
E U (Xs + Ys)s + U (Xs + Ys)(s + Zs) · hsds = 0.
0

(3.9)

Now fix i in {1, . . . , d1}. Let Ais := U (Xs + Ys)s + U (Xs + Ys)(si + Zsi) and hs :=
(0, . . . , 0, 1Ais>0, 0, . . . , 0) where the non-vanishing component is the i-th component. From (3.9) we get that

T
E 1Asi >0[U (Xs + Ys)si + U (Xs + Ys)(si + Zsi)]ds = 0.
0

Hence, Ai  0, dP  dt - a.e.. Similarly by choosing hs = (0, . . . , 0, 1Asi <0, 0, . . . , 0) we deduce that

U (X + Y )i + U (X + Yt)(ti + Zti) = 0, dP  dt - a.e.

This concludes the proof since i  {1, . . . , d1} is arbitrary.

The verification theorem above can also be expressed in terms of a fully-coupled ForwardBackward system.

The converse implication of Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 constitutes the second main result.

which solves the FBSDE (3.10) satisfying: Z is in H2(Rd), E[|U (XT +H)|] < , E[|U (XT + H)|2] < , and U (X + Y ) is a positive martingale. Moreover, assume that there exists a

We have proved in Theorem 3.2 that if (2.2) exhibits an optimal strategy   x, then there exists an adapted solution to the FBSDE (3.10). As a byproduct we showed the optimization procedure singles out a "pricing measure" under which the asset prices and marginal utilities are martingales. In that sense, the process Y captures the impact of future trading gains on the agent's marginal utilities. If we assume additional conditions on the utility function U , we get the following regularity properties of the solution (X, Y, Z).

Proposition 3.6. Assume that for H  L(, FT , P) and that the FBSDE (3.10) admits an adapted solution (X, Y, Z) such that Y is bounded. Let

U (x)

1(x) :=

U

, (x)

U (3)(x)|U (x)|2 2(x) := (U (x))3 ,

U (3)(x)

3(x) :=

U

, (x)

x  R.

Assume that U is such that i, i = 1, 2, 3 are bounded and Lipschitz continuous functions. Then (X, Y, Z) is the unique solution of (3.10) in S2(R) × S(R) × H2(Rd). In addition,
Z · W is a BMO-martingale.

12

Proof. Let (X, Y, Z) be a solution to (3.10) such that Y is bounded. Then, using the

usual theory on quadratic growth BSDEs (see for example [20, Theorem 2.5 and Lemma

3.1]) we have only from the backward part of the FBSDE that Z is in H2(Rd) and that

Z · W is a BMO-martingale. In addition there exists a unique solution to the backward

component in this space for a given process X. Now the previous regularity properties

of the processes (Y, Z) imply that X is in S2(R). We turn to the uniqueness of the X

process. Assume that there exists another solution (X , Y , Z ) of (3.10). Hence, Theorem

3.5 implies that 

:=

U U

(X (X

+Y +Y

) )

Z

i,

i  {1, . . . , d1} is an optimal solution to our

original problem (2.2) and X is the optimal wealth process. However, by strict concavity

of U and by convexity of x the optimal strategy has to be unique. So X and X are

the wealth processes of the same optimal strategy, thus, they have to coincide (for instance

XT = XT , P - a.s.) which implies (Y , Z ) = (Y, Z).

2

In the complete case we are able to construct the solution (X, Y, Z). This is the subject of the following Section.

3.2 Characterization and verification: complete markets
In this section we consider the benchmark case of a complete market. We assume d = 1 for simplicity. H denotes a square integrable random variable measurable with respect to the Brownian motion W .

In the complete case we can give sufficient conditions for the existence of a solution to the system (3.10). Our construction relies on the following remark.
Remark 3.7. Using (3.10) the martingale U (X +Y ) becomes more explicit, because It^o's formula applied to U (X + Y ) yields

U (Xt + Yt) = U (x + Y0) + = U (x + Y0) -

where we have replaced  by its characterization in terms of (X, Y, Z) from Theorem 3.1.

Hence,

U (Xt + Yt) = U (x + Y0)E(- · W )t, t  [0, T ].

(3.13)

This remark will allow us to prove existence of a solution to the system (3.10) under

a

condition

on

of U .

To this end, we give a sufficient

condition on U for the system (3.10) to exhibit a solution. We have the following remark.

Remark 3.8. If (X, Y, Z) is an adapted solution to the system (3.10), then P := X + Y is solution of the forward SDE

(3.14)

In addition, if (X, Y, Z) is in S2(R) × S2(R) × H2(Rd), then P  S2(R). Thus a necessary condition for the FBSDE (3.10) to have a solution is that the SDE (3.14) admits a solution.

Using

the

regularity

properties of 1 and 2 and the fact that  is bounded, there exists a constant K > 0 such

that

|f (s, p, z)|  K(1 + |z|)

and the constant K depends only on 1, 2 and on  , thus in particular K does not
depend on m. Since the driver f is Lipschitz in z, there exists a unique pair of adapted processes (Y m, Zm) in S2(R) × H2(Rd) which solves (3.16). In addition, |Ytm|  K holds Pa.s. for all t in [0, T ]. We recall that this constant K does not depend on m, thus |Y0m|  K. Using usual arguments we can show that the map m  Y0m is continuous. Even if this procedure is somehow standard, we reprove this fact here to make the paper self-contained. Fix m, m in R with m = m . We set Yt := Ytm - Ytm , Zt := Ztm - Ztm . By (3.16) it follows that (Y, Z) is solution to the Lipschitz BSDE:

t[0,T ]

Combining the inequalities above with classical estimates on Lipschitz SDEs (see for example [23, Estimate (***) in the proof of Theorem V.7.37]) we finally get that

|Y0|2  C|m - m |2

which concludes the proof by letting m being bounded yields that there exists an

tending element

to m. This conjunction with m  R such that Y0m = m.

m  Y0m Setting

Xtm := Ptm - Ytm , t  [0, T ],

it is straightforward to check that (Xm, Y m, Zm) satisfies (3.15). Moreover, we have Xm  S2(R) since Y m is bounded and since P m  S2(R). Next, note that E[|U (XT + YT )|2] <  since U (XT + YT ) = U (x + m)E(- · W ). Now using the concavity of U , it
holds that

U (x)  U (0)x + U (0), -U (x)  -U (x)x - U (0), x  R.

Consequently,

E[|U (XT + H)|]  E[|U (0)| |XT + H| + |U (0)|] + E[|U (XT + H)(XT + H)| + |U (0)|] < .

4 Utility functions on the positive half-line
In this section we study utility functions U : R+  R defined on the positive half-line. Again, we assume that U is strictly increasing and strictly concave.

In the previous section we have derived a FBSDE characterization of the optimal strat-

egy for the utility maximization problem (2.2). The key observation was that there exists a

stochastic process Y such that U (X + Y ) is a martingale. However if U is only defined

on the positive half-line, it is not clear a priori that the expression U (X + Y ) makes

sense. We could generalize this approach is a martingale and such that (XT, YT )

by =

looking U (XT

for a function  such that (Xt, Yt) + H). When H = 0, it turns out that

a good choice of function  is (x, y) := U (x) exp(y) since the system we obtain coincides

(up to a non-linear transformation) with the one obtained by Peng in [22, Section 4] using

the maximum principle. Note that the system of Peng is not formulated as a FBSDE but

rather as a system of equations: one for the wealth process whose dynamics depend on the

strategy and one adjoint equation, but a reformulation of this system of equation allows to

get a FBSDE (details are given in Section 5.1).

15

In the previous section,  denoted the total amount of money invested into the stock (the number of shares being /S~). Now we denote by i the proportion of wealth invested in the i-th stock Si. Once again we denote by x the set of admissible strategies with initial
capital x which is now defined by

From now one we consider a positive FT -measurable random variable H. We furthermore need to impose the following assumptions on U .

(H3) U : R+  R is three times differentiable, strictly increasing and concave

(H4) We say that assumption (H4) holds for an element  in x, if (i) E[|XT U (XT + H)|2] < ; (ii) the sequence of random variables

4.1 Characterization and verification: incomplete markets

Note that in condition (H4), if U (0) <  or if H  a > 0 is satisfied, then (iii) implies (ii).

Theorem 4.1. Assume that (H3) holds and that H is a positive random variable belonging to L2(, FT , P). Let  be an optimal solution to (2.2) satisfying E[|U (XT + H)|] < 
and which satisfies assumption (H4). Then there exists a predictable process Y with YT = log(U (XT + H)) - log(U (XT)) such that XU (X) exp(Y ) is a martingale and

Proof. As in the proof of Theorem 3.1, we prove the existence of Y such that XU (X) exp(Y )

is U

a martingale with YT = log(U (XT) exp(YT ). By (H4), the

log(U

where  is a square integrable predictable process with values in Rd. We set Y := log() - log(U (X)) - log(X). As in the proof of Theorem 3.1, It^o's formula implies that

We now derive the characterization of  in terms of U and Y and Z. We employ an argument put forth in [22] and then substitute the Hamiltonian by a BSDE. Fix   x.

Now let  be defined as

(4.3)

dt = (tt + tXt )dStH, t  [0, T ].

By (H4), we can apply Lebesgue's dominated convergence theorem in inequality (4.3) which, possibly passing to a subsequence, yields

Combined with (4.3), it leads to

E[T (XT )-1U (XT )XT exp(YT )] = E[T U (XT + H)]  0,   x.

(4.4)

We now restrict consideration to a particular class of processes , that is, we choose  to be a bounded predictable process and we define  :=  +  which is admissible strategy since
it is square integrable. The integration by parts formula for continuous semimartingales
implies that

tt
t(Xt )-1 = sdWsH + [s · sH - s · s]ds, t  [0, T ].

At()  0, dP  dt - a.e.

is an optimal solution to the optimization problem (2.2).

Proof. We first note that   x since by the fact that Z is in H2(Rd), there is a constant

C > 0 such that

TT
E |t|2dt  C E |ZtH + tH|2dt < .
00

Now let  be an element of x. Let D := U (X) exp(Y ). Applying Ito^'s formula and

plugging in the expression of , we find that

dDt = Dt(-tdWtH + ZtdWtO), D0 = U (x) exp(Y0),

hence,

··
Dt = U (x) exp(Y0)E - sdWsH + ZsdWsO , t  [0, T ],
0 0t

(4.9)

which is a positive local martingale. Now fix  in x. By definition of X and of D, the

product formula implies that XD satisfies

DX = xD0E(( - ) · W H + Z · W O).

20

Hence, XD is XU (X) exp(Y ) above, recalling

a supermartingale and
is a true martingale so that DT = U (XT + H)

sEo[DET[DXTTX ]T

]  D0x. By assumption, = D0x. Finally combining

and using the concavity of U , we obtain

X the

D= facts

E[U (XT + H) - U (XT + H)]  E[U (XT + H)(XT - XT)]  0.

(4.10)

Remark 4.3. In the previous proof, if we apply integration by parts formula to D = U (X) exp(Y ) and X - X, we get
··
U (X) exp(Y )(X - X ) = (Xt - Xt )dDt + Dt(tXt - tXt )dWtH,
00
thus U (X) exp(Y )(X - X) is a local martingale for every admissible strategy .

Remark 4.4. Note that using the regularity assumptions of the FBSDE (4.8), we derived that D := U (X) exp(Y ) is a true martingale

Dt = U (x) exp(Y0)E - · W H + ZO · W O .

4.2 Characterization and verification: complete markets

We adopt the setting and notations of Section 4 with d1 = d = 1 and H = 0. In the complete case we can give sufficient conditions for the existence of a solution to the system (4.8). To this end, note the following remark.

Remark 4.5. Similar to Remark 4.4, we can use (4.8) to characterize further the martingale U (X) exp(Y ): applying It^o's formula to U (X) exp(Y ) gives rise to

t
U (Xt) exp(Yt) = U (x) exp(Y0) - U (Xs) exp(Ys)sdWs,
0
hence, we have

We will

now give sufficient condition for the system (4.8) to exhibit a solution. We begin with the

following remark.

Remark 4.6. Note that if 2 is constant then the system above decouples. An elementary

analysis shows that this happens if and only is U is the exponential, power, log or quadratic

(mean-variance hedging) function. If U (x) = - exp(-1x) - exp(-2x) then 2 is bounded

and Lipschitz and if U (x) :=

x1 1

+

x2 2

then 2

is a bounded function.

21

Theorem 4.7. Assume that 2 is a continuous bounded function. Then there exists an adapted solution (X, Y, Z) in S2(Rd1) × S2(R) × H2(Rd) to the FBSDE

Moreover, E[|U (XT )|] <  and E[|U (XT )|2] < .

Since 2 is bounded, the driver of the BSDE above in (Y m, Zm) can be bounded uniformly in m, hence [12] yields a pair (Y m, Zm)  S2(R) × H2(R) solution to this equation with |Y m|  C where C does not depend on m and Z · W is a BMO-martingale. In addition
(once again using standard arguments like in the proof of Proposition 3.9) we have that m  Y0m is continuous. Thus there exists an element m > 0 such that Y0m = m. Now applying It^o's formula to

Xm := (U )-1(U (x) exp(m)E(- · W ) exp(-Y m)),

we check that (Xm, Y m, Zm) satisfies (4.12). It remains to show that E[|U (XT )|] < . From the concavity of U we have that

E[|U (XT )|]  |U (0)|E[|XT |] + |U (0)| + E[|U (XT )XT |] + |U (0)|.

5 Links to other approaches
In this section we link our approach to characterizing optimal investment strategies to two other approaches based on the stochastic maximum principle and duality theory, respectively.

5.1 Stochastic maximum principle
This section links our approach in the complete market setting to the approach using the stochastic maximum principle. As we are interested only in the link, we will only give a formal derivation. In particular, we suppose here that U and U -1 are smooth enough

22

with bounded derivatives. Let us consider the complete market case with d1 = d = 1 for simplicity and H = 0 and recall that in this setting, the wealth process is given by

tt
Xt = x + sdWs + ssds, t  [0, T ].
00
We consider J() := E[U (XT)] and set X~t := U (Xt). Ito^'s formula yields

dX~t = U (U -1(X~t))tdWt +

U

(U -1(X~t))tt

+

1 U
2

(U -1(X~t))|t|2 dt

and J() = E[X~T]. Applying the maximum principle technique described in [3] (see also [22, Section 4]), we introduce the adjoint equation to get

 

dX~t

=

U

(U -1(X~t))tdWt

(5.1)

We now introduce the corresponding Hamiltonian, defined as

H (t,

)

:=

p[U

(U -1(X~t))tt

+

1 U
2

(U -1(X~t))|t|2] + kU (U -1(X~t))t.

A formal maximization gives

t

:=

-U U

(U -1(X~t))

kt pt

t

.

Plugging this into (5.1) yields

 

dX~t

We now relate this system with (4.12) using a Cole-Hopf type transformation. First we plug  into (5.2) and obtain

Next consider the system

 dYt =

dt + ZtdWt, YT = 0.

(5.4)

Setting p~T := exp(Yt), k~ := Zp~ and X~ := X, Ito^'s formula implies that (p~, k~) is a solution to (5.3).

5.2 BSDE solution via convex duality methods

Let us now turn to a very important link of our approach with the convex duality theory.

We have seen in Sections 3 and 4 that our approach relies on choosing a process Y such that the quantities U (X + Y ) and XU (X) exp(Y ), respectively, are martingales. In fact,

these martingales are not any martingales. For instance in case of a utility function on the

whole real line, U

(X 

+

Y

)

is

exactly

U

(x

+

Y0 )E (-

·

WH

+

U U

(X + Y )ZO · W O).

So

in the complete case it is exactly the martingale under which the price is itself a martingale.

For utility functions defined on the positive half line this leads directly to duality theory,

since it is known from the original paper by Kramkov and Schachermayer ([13]) that (under some growth-type condition on U ) the optimal wealth process X and the stochastic process Y  solution to the so-called dual-problem are such that the stochastic process XY 

is a martingale. In addition, with our notations, Kramkov and Schachermayer prove that

Y  has the Recall that

form Y  = in our case

XY0EU(-(X ·W)

H+M exp(Y )

) where M is a is a martingale

martingale orthogonal to W H. and from (4.9), we have proved

that D := U (X) exp(Y ) is exactly of the form D0E(- · W H + ZO · W O), in other words

Y  = D and the ZO component appearing in the solution of our FBSDE exactly represents

the orthogonal part in the dual optimizer of Kramkov and Schachermayer theory. Obviously,

this needs to be derived more formally. This is the goal of this section.

The aim of this section is to derive a solution of the forward-backward equation (4.12) by means of the results from the convex duality approach to (2.2). We denote by 1 the set of admissible strategies with initial capital one unit of currency. In the case of zero endowment H = 0, the solution to the concave optimization problem (2.2) is achieved by formulating and solving the following dual problem: denoting the convex conjugate of the concave function U by

V (y) := sup U (x) - xy , y > 0,
x>0

where

dXt

=

Xt t

dS~t S~t

,

X0

= x > 0,

and

defining

a

family

of

nonnegative

semimartingales

via

Y := Y  0 : Y0 = 1, XY is a supermartingale for every   1 ,

the primal problem (2.2) is solved by solving instead the dual convex optimization problem

v(y)

=

inf E
YT Y

V (yYT )

,

y > 0.

(5.5)

If this dual problem admits a unique solution YT  Y, then the primal problem (2.2) with H = 0 also yields a unique solution

.

Here we have I = (U )-1 and x =

-v (y)2. The case of bounded terminal endowment H is dealt with in [5], where instead of

(5.5) the following dual problem is considered

v(y) = inf E V (yYT ) + yYT H , y > 0.
YT Y
The case of general integrable H has been studied in [10], using the original dual problem (5.5) but a slight different choice of the domain Y. A ubiquitous property of the convex duality method is that once the primal and the dual optimizers are obtained, their product XY  is a nonnegative true martingale (hence uniformly integrable), see [13] for a economic interpretation. In the context of utility maximization with bounded random endowments, this martingale property of XY  is pointed out in [5, Remark 4.6]. This martingale property of XY  constitutes the first main ingredient for deriving a solution for the forward-backward equation (4.12). A second main ingredient is constituted by the characterization of the dual domain Y. Note in the continuous process setting, Y is the family of all non-negative supermartingales (see e.g. [13, 10]). According to a well known result, every nonnegative c`adla`g supermartingale Y  Y admits a unique multiplicative decomposition
Y = AM

where A is a predictable, non-increasing process such that A0 = 1 and M is c`adla`g local martingale. However, [15] characterize the elements of Y  Y by the multiplicative
decomposition

Y = AE(-H · W H + K · W O),

(5.6)

where A is a predictable non-increasing process such that A0 = 1 and K  Hl2oc(Rd2) (see [15, Proposition 3.2]). Using that the Fenchel-Legendre transform V is strictly decreasing,
[15, Corollary 3.3] shows that the dual optimizer is a (continuous) local martingale and
admits the representation

Y  = E - H · W H + K · W O

(5.7)

for a uniquely determined K  Hl2oc(Rd2). If v(y) = E V (yYT) < , then we can check that the optimal K actually belongs to H2(Rd2). This is done in the following lemma whose proof is in the same spirit as in [14, Lemma 3.2]

Lemma 5.1. If for some y > 0, it holds that

v(y) = inf E V yE - H · W H +  · W O
Hl2oc(Rd2 )

< ,

we have

v(y) = inf E V yE - H · W H +  · W O ,
H2(Rd2 )

i.e. the optimal K minimizing v(y) can be assumed to belong to H2(Rd2).

2This is equivalent to u (x) = y where u(x) = sup E U (XT + H) . The differentiability of both v(y) and u(x) are shown in [5].

25

Proof. We introduce the family of stopping times

t

 n := inf t > 0 :

|sH|2 + |Ks|2 ds  n , n  N.

0

Let y > 0, then we have

v(y) = E V yET - H · W H + K · W O = E E V yET - H · W H + K · W O Fn  E V yEn - H · W H + K · W O ,

where the last line follows by Jensen's inequality. Continuing the last line and recalling that V (y) is a strictly convex function, we have

v(y)  E V y exp  V E y exp  V y exp E

Now using that XY  is a true martingale and that the dual optimizer Y  is a local martingale satisfying (5.7), we get the following result.

Theorem 5.2. Let H be a non-negative bounded random endowment and assume that the coefficient of relative risk aversion - xU (x) satisfies
U (x)

lim sup - xU (x) < .

x

U (x)

(5.8)

Then there exists x0 > 0 such that for all x > x0 the coupled FBSDE (4.8) has a solution
(X, Y, Z) such that X0 = x. In addition, X is the optimal wealth of the problem (2.2) and the dual optimizer Y  associated with it is given by Y  = U (X) exp(Y ) (so that yYT = U (XT + H)).

26

Proof. The existence of x0 > 0 such that for every x > x0 the quantity

u(x) = sup E U XT + H = E U XT + H
x

is finite has been shown [5]. We set X := X. Also recall that we have y = u (x) > 0 for

x > x0 and that we have

E yXT YT = xy.

Moreover, yYT = U (XT + H). We define the true martingale  := yXY . We set Y := log() - log(X) - log(U (X)). We have that

Yt = log

t XtU (Xt)

= log

yYt U (Xt)

= log(y) + log(Yt) - log(U (Xt).

Recall that by definition of X and Y  we have that

dYt = Yt -tHdWtH + KtdWtO

and Hence

dXt = Xt tdWtH + ttHdt .

dYt

We define:

so

that

Finally note that by construction YT = log

U (XT +H) U (XT )

. Hence, (X, Y, Z) = (X, Y, Z) is a

solution to (4.8) and

yY  = U (X) exp(Y ).

2

Let us recall that the absolute risk aversion of U (x) is defined as ARA(x) := - U (x)
U (x)

and the risk tolerance

as

1 ARA(x)

.

We say that U (x) has hyperbolic absolute risk aversion

(HARA)

if

and

only

if

its

risk

tolerance

1 ARA(x)

is

linear

in

x.

More precisely, it can be

shown that a utility function U (x) is HARA if and only if

U (x) =

for given real numbers , a, b  R.

Corollary 5.3. Assume that U (x) is HARA. Then there exists a constant   R such that the backward equation from (4.8) can be written as

it holds that

Since U (x) being HARA implies that f is linear in x, it follows that there exist constants c, d  R such that f (x) = cx + d. Hence the BSDE from (4.8) can also be written as

Obviously the driver of the BSDE (5.9), g(s, z), satisfies the quadratic growth condition

|g(s, z)|   +  |z|2 2

for suitably chosen real numbers ,  > 0. In this setting [4, Theorem 2] yields the following result.

Corollary 5.4. If  = log

U (XT +H) U (XT )

satisfies E e|| < , then the BSDE (5.9) admits

a solution (Y, Z) such that Y is continuous and Z  Hl2oc(Rd).

5.3 The power case with general endowment

We finally deal with an open question in mathematical Finance namely the case of power

utility with general endowment. We know from duality theory that an optimal solution

exists but we would like to prove that the strategy is smooth (i.e. square integrable) and

to characterize it in terms of the solution to an equation (for instance a FBSDE). We will

use definitions and notations of Section 4.

Let U (x) :=

x 

with  a fixed parameter in

(0, 1). Let H be a positive bounded FT -measurable random variable where we recall that

(Ft)t[0,T ] is the filtration generated by W = (W H, W O). We recall that we denote by x

the set of admissible strategies with initial capital x which is now defined by

T

x :=  :  × [0, T ]  Rd1,  is predictable, E

|s|2ds < 

0

(5.10)

where i, i = 1, . . . , d1 denotes the proportion of wealth invested in the stock. The associated wealth process is given by

t
Xt := x + sXsdSsH, t  [0, T ].
0

Again, we extend  to Rd via ~ := (1, . . . , d1, 0, . . . , 0) and make the convention that we write  instead of ~. Thus, we have

Xt = xE

·
rdSrH , t  [0, T ].
0t

Note that this setting covers the case of a purely orthogonal endowment of the form H := (STO) where  is positive. Now we can go in the analysis of the problem:

sup E
x

(XT + H) 

.

(5.11)

Indeed, what is only known in that case is that an optimal strategy exists ([10]) but in a much larger space that x, in particular it is not proved that the optimal strategy is square integrable. About the characterization of this optimal strategy one can write the HamiltonJacobi-Bellman PDE in the Markovian case but no results allow us to solve it. We believe that combining the duality theory, BSDEs techniques and our approach we could show first that the optimal strategy belongs to the space x and that we will give a characterization of it in terms of a FBSDE. Let us be more precise.

29

i

:=

1 (Zi 1-

+ i),

i

=

1, . . . , d1

(5.13)

is the optimal solution to the maximization problem (5.11).

Proof.

First

note

that

the

system

(5.12)

is

exactly

the

system

(4.8)

with

U (x) =

x 

.

Hence

from Theorem 5.2 there exists x0 > 0 such that the system (5.12) admits a solution (X, Y, Z)

when x > x0. We fix, x > x0 and consider the associated solution (X, Y, Z) (that is X0 = x). In addition, we know from Theorem 5.2 that X = X. Hence  is given by (5.13). It just

remains to prove that  is in x, which is a direct consequence of the fact that Z is in

H2(Rd).

2

Remark 5.6. Note that since we know that the dual optimizer Y  is given by Y  =
U (X) exp(Y ) it is clear that XU (X) exp(Y ) is a true martingale. Hence the square integrability of Z implies the condition of Theorem 4.2: E[(XT + H)] < . Finally notice that ZO is in H2(Rd2) by Lemma 5.1.

So the only element missing in the proof is indeed to show that ZH is in H2(Rd1) (naturally, since the process  is integrable with respect to SH and so it is in H2(Rd1)). This
question requires a deeper analysis of the system and is currently investigated by the authors.
