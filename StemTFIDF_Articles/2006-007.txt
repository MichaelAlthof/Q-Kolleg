Robust utility maximization in a stochastic factor model
Daniel Hern´andez­Hern´andez and Alexander Schied August 30, 2006

Abstract: We give an explicit PDE characterization for the solution of a robust utility maximization problem in an incomplete market model, whose volatility, interest rate process, and long-term trend are driven by an external stochastic factor process. The robust utility functional is defined in terms of a HARA utility function with negative risk aversion and a dynamically consistent coherent risk measure, which allows for model uncertainty in the distributions of both the asset price dynamics and the factor process. Our method combines two recent advances in the theory of optimal investments: the general duality theory for robust utility maximization and the stochastic control approach to the dual problem of determining optimal martingale measures.

1 Introduction

One of the fundamental problems in mathematical finance is the construction of investment strategies that maximize the utility functional of a risk-averse investor. In the vast majority of the corresponding literature it is assumed that the optimality criterion is based on a classical expected utility functional of the form

X - E[ U (X) ],

(1)

where U is a utility function. This concept involves the expected value with respect to

the probability measure P, which is usually assumed to model accurately future stock

price evolutions. In reality, however, the choice of this probability measure is subject to

model risk, and it may thus be reasonable to replace the expectation operator in (1) by

(the negative of) a coherent risk measure, thus obtaining a robust utility functional of the

form

Optimal investment problems for robust utility amount to the maximization of functionals (2) over the set of possible payoffs arising from admissible trading strategies. Such problems were considered, among others, by Talay and Zheng [?], Quenez [19], Schied [20, 21], Burgert and Ru¨schendorf [4], Schied and Wu [22], Mu¨ller [18], and F¨ollmer and Gundel [11]. See also Hansen and Sargent [15] and Bordigoni et al. [3] for the analysis of a related problem involving entropic penalties. Most of these papers use either the duality method (sometimes also called the `martingale method') [11, 19, 21, 22] or stochastic control techniques based on backward stochastic differential equations [3, 18, 19]. Talay and Zheng [?] apply a PDE-based control approach directly to the primal maximin problem and obtain a characterization of the value function as viscosity solution of a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs equation with a game-type nonlinearity.
In this paper, we will present a new approach that consists in combining the duality results from [21, 22] with a stochastic control approach to the dual problem of determining optimal martingale measures. This stochastic control approach was recently developed by Castan~eda-Leyva and Hern´andez-Hern´andez [5, 6] for utility maximization problems in incomplete financial market models, whose volatility, interest rate process, and trend are driven by an external stochastic factor process. The basic idea in [5, 6] is to derive a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellmann PDE for the dual value function, which involves the `risk premia' of equivalent local martingale measures as control processes. Already in standard utility maximization problems, this approach turned our to be very powerful as it provides an explicit characterization of optimal strategies in terms of the unique classical solution of a nonlinear PDE, which then can be solved numerically. As for robust utility maximization, it was already observed by Quenez [19] that it is natural to apply control methods to the dual problem rather than to the primal one, since the dual value function v of the robust problem has a much simpler structure than the primal value function u: The function v is defined in terms of an infimum taken over a two-parameter set, while u involves an infimum with respect to one and a supremum with respect to another parameter.
In setting up our model, we will use the framework of [5, 6] to set up our reference model and then suppose that the dynamics of both the asset prices and the stochastic factor process are subject to model uncertainty. To this end, we have to specify the prior set Q occurring in the representation (2) of the robust utility functional. While the duality method works for very general prior sets, the use of control techniques requires the restriction to classes Q that satisfy a property of dynamic consistency as described, e.g., by Artzner et al. [2], Delbaen [7], and Epstein and Schneider [8]. We also need to work with a very specific utility function, namely a HARA utility function
U (x) = 1 x 
with risk aversion parameter  < 0. The cases  = 0 and  > 0 are also feasible but require different methods, so that they will be treated elsewhere.
This loss of generality in comparison with the duality method will be rewarded by much more specific results, which are apt to explicit numerical computations. More precisely,

3

our main result provides explicit formulas for both the optimal strategy and the robust value function in terms of the unique bounded classical solution of a nonlinear PDE. In particular, we avoid the use of viscosity solutions. As a byproduct, we also obtain a formula for the least-favorable martingale measure in the sense of F¨ollmer and Gundel [11].
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe the set-up of the problem and state a theorem containing our main findings. This theorem will be proved in the subsequent sections. The dual problem for our robust utility maximization problem is formulated in Section 3. In Section 4 we derive a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman PDE for the value function of the dual problem. In Section 5 we finally get back to the primal problem and show how the optimal investment strategy can be derived from our solution to the dual problem.

2 Statement of main results

We consider a financial market model with a locally riskless money market account

dSt0 = St0r(Yt) dt

(3)

and a risky asset defined under a reference measure P through the SDE

dSt = Stb(Yt) dt + St(Yt) dWt1.

(4)

Here W 1 is a standard P-Brownian motion and Y denotes an external economic factor process modeled by the SDE

dYt = g(Yt) dt +  dWt1 + 1 - 2 dWt2

(5)

for some correlation factor   [-1, 1] and a standard P-Brownian motion W 2, which is independent of W 1 under P. We suppose that the economic factor cannot be traded directly so that the market model is typically incomplete. It will be convenient to use the
shorthand notation  := 1 - 2.

We assume that g(·) is in C1(R), with derivative g  Cb1(R), and r(·), b(·), and (·) belong to Cb2(R), where Cbk(R) denotes the class of bounded functions with bounded
derivatives up to order k. The assumption of time-independent coefficients is for notational

convenience only and can easily be relaxed. The `market price of risk' is defined via the

function

b(y) - r(y)

(y) :=

,

(y)

and we will assume that (·)  0 > 0 for some constant 0. In most economic situations, investors typically face model uncertainty in the sense
that the dynamics of the relevant quantities are not precisely known. One common

4

approach to coping with model uncertainty is to admit an entire class Q of possible prior models; see, e.g., [13, Section 2.5]. Here, we will consider the class

Q :=

QP

dQ = E dP

1t dWt1 + 2t dWt2 ,  = (1, 2)  C , T

where E(M )t = exp(Mt - M t/2) denotes the Doleans-Dade exponential of a local martingale M and C denotes the set of all progressively measurable processes  = (1, 2) such that t belongs dt  dP-a.e. to some fixed compact convex set   R2. Note that due to Novikov's theorem we have a one-to-one correspondence between measures Q  Q

and processes   C (up to dt  dP-nullsets).

describes the evolution of the wealth process Xx, of an investor with initial endowment X0x, = x > 0 investing the fraction s of the current wealth into the risky asset at time s  [0, T ]. The strategy  is called admissible at level x if Xx,  0, and we denote by
A(x) the set of all such strategies.

As already menioned in the introduction, the cases  = 0 and  > 0 are also feasible

but require different methods and will be discussed elsewhere. We summarize our main

findings in the following theorem.

and  := -/(1 - ). If the -valued function  = (t, y) realizes the maximum in (9),

then an optimal strategy  for the robust problem can be obtained by letting t = (t, Yt)

for

(t, y) =

1 (y)

(1 - )(1(t, y) + (y)) + wy(t, y)

.

Moreover, by defining a measure Q  Q via

dQ = E dP

1(t, Yt) dWt1 + 2(t, Yt) dWt2 ,
0 0T

we obtain a saddlepoint (, Q) for the maximin problem (7).

Remark 2.2 If the coefficients b and  are constant, then the value function u will clearly not depend on Y0. Hence, w will be constant and wy will vanish. Determining the optimal  will thus be reduced to finding the value 1 closest to . We hence recover a particular case of the results in [19, Section 7.5] and [20, Section 3.1]. A similar situation occurs if  = 0 and  is a rectangle: it will again be optimal to minimize the distance between 1 and . In particular, Q will locally be a martingale measure and our formula for  shows that there will be no investment into the risky asset as long as the factor process Y stays in the region
N := y  R | (-(y), 2)   for some 2  R}.
A nonzero correlation factor , however, can change the picture. More precisely, let us assume that the factor wy is nonzero on N , which seems to be plausible provided that Y can exit N with positive probability. In this case, our formula for  shows that even for Yt  N there will be a nontrivial investment into the risky asset--despite the fact that we can turn discounted asset prices locally into a martingale by choosing an appropriate Q  Q. This effect occurs as a tradeoff between the tendencies of minimizing asset returns and driving Y further away from `favorable regions' under the `worst-case measure' Q. It could be interesting to see this intuition confirmed by numerical experiments.

Remark 2.3 As a byproduct of our proof, we also obtain an explicit formula for a least favorable martingale measure P  as considered by Fo¨llmer and Gundel [11]. It is associ-
ated to our optimal strategy via the formula

3 Formulation of the dual problem

In this section, we will first use robust duality theory as to reduce the solution of our original problem to its dual problem. The dual problem will then be solved by stochastic

6

control techniques in Section 4. The duality theory for robust utility maximization problems of the form (7) was developed by Quenez [19], Schied and Wu [22], and Schied [21]. Utility functions of the form (8) are ruled out by [19, Assumption 5.1], and so we will rely on [22, 21] as our sources of reference on duality.
To check for the applicability of the results in [22, 21], note first that our utility function (8) belongs to C1, is increasing and strictly concave, and satisfies the Inada conditions U (0+) =  and U (-) = 0. It also has asymptotic elasticity AE(U ) = lim supx xU (x)/U (x) = 0 < 1. Moreover, our prior set Q satisfies [22, Assumption 2.1]:

Lemma 3.1 The set {dQ/dP | Q  Q} is convex and closed in L0(P).

Proof: Let us introduce the notation

Dt := E

1s dWs1 + 2s dWs2

0 0t

for   C.

(11)

To show convexity, we take 0    1 and ,   C. Following Delbaen [7], we see that the
martingale D := D + (1 - )De satisfies the SDE dDt = Dt(1t dWt1 + 2t dWt2), where t = tt + (1 - t)t is at each time a convex combination of  and  with coefficient

t

=

Dt

Dt + (1 -

)Dte .

Hence,  takes values in  and belongs to C. To prove the closedness assertion, note first that, for any p  R,

E[ (DT )p ] = E

Thus, if DTn converges in probability to some random variable D  L0(P), then both DTn

and (DTn)-1 converge in Lp(P) for any p  1. It thus follows easily that the stochastic

and

define

Zt := E - (Ys) dWs1 - s dWs2 . t
Then one easily shows that ZtXtx,/St0 is a positive local P-martingale and hence a Psupermartingale for all   M and   A(x). That is, every process Z belongs to the class Y(1) as defined in [16] and further considered in a robust framework in [22, 21].

7

Moreover, the density process of every equivalent local martingale measure is of the form Z for some   M. Hence, it follows from [16, Theorem 2.2] that the dual value function with subjective measure P is given by

uP()

inf
M

U (ZT /ST0 )

 > 0,

where U (z) = supx0(U (x)-zx) is the Fenchel-Legendre transform of the convex function -U (-x). If we use instead of P another subjective measure Q  Q with density D :=
dQ/dP, then the corresponding dual value function is of the form

uQ()

=

inf
M

E

DU (ZT /(DST0 ))

.

It thus follows from [22, Theorems 2.2 and 2.6] that the dual value function of the robust utility maximization problem is given as

can then be obtained as

u(x) = min(u() + x). >0

(13)

Moreover, if there are (, ) control processes minimizing (12), then [21, Theorem 2.6] yields the existence of an optimal strategy   A(x), whose terminal wealth is given by

XTx,b = I

where I(y) := -U (y) and  > 0 minimizes (13). In our specific setting (8), we have

Note that 0 <  < 1. Thus, we can simplify the duality formula (13) as follows. First, the expectation in (12) can be computed as

4 HJB solution of the dual problem

In this section, we will solve the dual problem by stochastic control techniques. Here we rely on the methods developed by Castan~eda-Leyva and Herna´ndez-Hern´andez [5, 6], and we will extend them to our robust setting.
Our aim is to maximize , over   C and   M0. To this end, let us now consider a starting time t  [0, T ] replacing our previous choice t = 0. This will be formalized by introducing the measure Pt,y under which the processes (Su0)ut, (Su)ut, and (Yu)ut satisfy their respective stochastic differential equations (3), (4), and (5) with initial conditions
St0 = 1, St = arbitrary, and Yt = y.
Also, under Pt,y all stochastic exponentials will only involve martingale increments from time t onwards, e.g.,

TT
ZT = exp - (Ys) dWs1 - s dWs2
tt
Let us now introduce the function

Pt,y -a.s.

J (t, y, , ) := Et,y (DT )1-(ZT )(ST0 )-

= Et,y T, exp

T
q(Ys, s, s) ds
t

so that J(0, Y0, , ) = , and J(T, y, , ) = 1. We will now use dynamic programming methods to solve the stochastic control problem with value function defined by

V (t, y) := sup sup J(t, y, , ).
M0 C

To this end, we first fix two controls   C and   M0. We can then define a new probability measure Pt,y,  Pt,y by dPt,y, = T, dPt,y. According to (16), we have

J (t, y, , ) = Et,,y exp

T
q(Ys, s, s) ds .
t

There are two Pt,y,-Brownian motions W 1,, and W 2,, such that

dWs1 = dWs1,, + (1 - )1s - (Ys) ds dWs1 = dWs2,, + (1 - )2t - s ds.

The parameter process Y then satisfies the SDE

dYs = dWs, + g(Ys) +  (1 - )1s - (Ys) +  (1 - )2s - s ds,

where W , :=  W 1,, + W 2,, is a Pt,y,-Brownian motion. Standard control theory [10] now suggests that the function V is (formally) a solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman

10

(HJB) equation

1 0 = vt + 2 vyy + (g - )vy+
sup sup (1 - )1 +  (1 - )2 - 
R 

vy + q(·, , )v

with terminal condition

v(T, y) = 1.

This formal argument is made precise by the main result of this section:

(17) (18)

Theorem 4.1 The function V (t, y) is the unique bounded classical solution of the HJB equation (17)­(18).

The proof of this theorem will be prepared by two auxiliary lemmas, the first being a standard verification result. These lemmas will first be applied with the choice I := [-M, M ], which corresponds to restricting the control space for  in (17). The fact that I is compact will allow us to apply existence results for classical solutions vI of the corresponding HJB equation. An application of Lemma 4.3 will then guarantee that vI also solves the original HJB equation (17) provided that M is large enough. Choosing I := R in Lemma 4.2 will then yield the desired result. The proof of Theorem 4.1 will be given after the one of Lemma 4.3.

Lemma 4.2 Let I be a nonempty real interval, which is either compact or equal to R, and suppose that the HJB equation

I

(19)

admits a bounded classical solution vI satisfying the terminal condition

vI(T, y) = 1.

(20)

In case I = R we assume furthermore that vI is bounded away from 0 and has a bounded gradient. Then we have vI(t, y) = V I(t, y), where

V I(t, y) := sup sup J(t, y, , )
C MI

(21)

for MI denoting the set of all I-valued   M0. In particular, we have uniqueness of bounded classical solutions.

Proof: For   I and    we define a differential operator A, by

A, f

Now let   C and   MI be arbitrary controls. Then, by It^o's formula and (19), the function v := vI satisfies

(23)

Sending n   and using the boundedness of v and q+ together with the terminal condition v(T, ·) = 1, we obtain v  V I. In particular, v is strictly positive.
In order to prove the reverse inequality, note first that the supremum of the nonlinear term in (19) with respect to   R is attained in

(24)

which is always well-defined, due to the strict positivity of v. Hence, the supremum with respect to   I is also attained, and we may find Markov controls

(, )  arg max (1 - )1 +  (1 - )2 -  vy(t, y) + q(y, , )v ,
 I ,
which by a measurable selection argument can be chosen as measurable functions (t, y), (t, y) of t and y. Using the controls s := (s, Ys), s := (s, Ys), we get an equality in (22) and hence in (23).

Furthermore, we have the following estimates for the value function V I.

Lemma 4.3 For a nonempty closed interval I containing the origin, let V I be the value

function defined in (21). Then there exists a finite constant K1 depending only on , , r,

g, and  such that

e-(T -t)K1  V I (t, y)  e(T -t)K1 .

Furthermore, V I is Lipschitz continuous, and its y-derivative satisfies

|VyI (t, y)| V I(t, y)



K2

for a.e. y,

where K2 is a finite constant depending only on , , r, T , g, and .

12

Proof: Clearly,

q(y, , )  |r| =: K1(+),

so that

V I (t, y)  sup sup Et,y[ t , ] · e(T -t)K1(+) = e .(T -t)K1(+) C MI

Moreover, for arbitrary   ,

- |r| =: -K1(-),

so that

V I (t, y)  J (t, y, , 0)  e .-(T -t)K1(-)

Taking K1 := K1(+)  K1(-) thus gives the first assertion. For the proof of the second one we fix   C and   MI. Let Y and Y denote

solutions of the SDE (5) corresponding to initial values Yt = y and Yt = y under Pt,y.

Then

u
|Yu - Yu|  |y - y| + |g | |Ys - Ys| ds,
t

so that by Gronwall's lemma

|Yu - Yu|  |y - y| · e|g |(u-t).

Furthermore,

where  and  are the stochastic exponentials of the integrals with respect to W 1. Due to our assumption   MI  M0, the rightmost stochastic exponential is the density of a probability measure P  Pt,y, under which the law of W 1 remains unchanged. Thus,

Since both  and 1 are bounded and W 1 is a P -Brownian motion, E[ T2 ] is bounded by a constant c1, which only depends on  and . Hence, Gronwall's lemma and (27) yield

Et,y[ |u, - u,| ]  c2|y - y|,

(28)

where c2 only depends on , ,  and T . Now we get from (26), (25), and (28) that

Thus, V I(t, ·) is Lipschitz continuous with constant K2, and the proof is completed by taking K2 := K2eK1T .

Proof of Theorem 4.1: We first restrict the control space for  to some bounded interval I := [-M, M ]. Then, from [10, Theorem IV.4.2 and Remark IV.3.3], there exists a bounded classical solution vI of the HJB equation (19)­(20). By Lemma 4.2, this solution is unique and corresponds to the value function V I. As observed in (24), the
supremum with respect to  in (19) is achieved at

Hence the set I in (19) can be substituted by R, obtaining a bounded classical solution v := V I to (19)­(20). Another application of Lemma 4.2 yields v = V R = V .

Corollary 4.4 The function log V (t, y) is the unique classical solution in Cb1([0, T ]×R) C1,2([0, T ] × R) of the HJB equation (9)­(10).

Proof: The nonlinear term in (17) can be simplified by computing first the infimum over   R. To this end, we insert the optimal value (24) for  back into the nonlinear term and obtain

Thus, V solves the HJB equation obtained by replacing the nonlinear term in (17) with the right-hand side of (29), and a simple computation shows that w := log V solves (9). Conversely, if w is a bounded classical solution of (9)­(10), then we can define v := ew and reverse the chain of arguments to conclude that v solves (17) and in turn is equal to V.

5 Back to the primal problem

In this section, we will complete the proof of Theorem 2.1 by using duality methods in

obtaining a solution of the primal problem from the solution of the dual problem. To this end, recall from (14) and (15) that the terminal value of the optimal wealth process XTx,b is given by

XTx,b = I

ZTb DTb ST0

,

where I(y) = -U (y) = y-1,  = (t, Yt) and  = (t, Yt) are optimal Markovian

controls, and

By [21, Theorem 2.6], the process Mt := Xtx,bZtb/St0 is a P-martingale. Hence, (6) yields that

dMt Mt

=

t(Yt) dWt1

dZtb

=

t(Yt) - (Yt)

dWt1 - t dWt2,

(30)

where the computation simplifies by using the martingale property to conclude that all finite-variation terms must cancel out. On the other hand, by the Markov property,

Thus, we get

Mt = E[ MT | Ft ] = E

where the martingale property again significantly simplifies the computation. Comparing here and in (30) all terms involving dW 1 yields

This completes the proof of Theorem 2.1.
