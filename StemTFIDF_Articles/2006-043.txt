An iteration procedure for solving integral equations related to optimal stopping problems
Denis Belomestny and Pavel V. Gapeev
A new algorithm for finding value functions of finite horizon optimal stopping problems in one-dimensional diffusion models is presented. It is based on a time discretization of the corresponding integral equation. The proposed iterative procedure for solving the discretized integral equation converges in a finite number of steps and delivers in each step a lower or an upper bound for value of discretized problem on the whole time interval. The remarks on the application of the method for solving integral equations related to some optimal stopping problems are given.
1 Introduction
Optimal stopping problems with finite time horizon play an important role in the literature on stochastic control (see e.g. [29] for general theory). One of the interesting and important problems in this domain is the pricing early exercise American options which has come from the mathematical theory of modern finance. This problem was first studied by McKean [17] who derived a freeboundary problem for the value function and the optimal stopping boundary of an early exercise American option and obtained a countable system of nonlinear integral equations for the boundary. Kim [14], Jacka [11], and Carr, Jarrow and Myneni [4] (see also Myneni [18]) have independently arrived at a nonlinear integral equation for the exercise boundary of the American put option which follows from the more general early exercise premium (EEP) representation. The uniqueness of solution has been recently proven by Peskir [22].

Since the value function and the stopping boundary of a general finite horizon optimal stopping problem cannot be found in an explicit form, some different numerical procedures for calculating the value and the boundary have been proposed. Carr [3] presented a method based on the randomization of the horizon using the Erlang distribution, which is equivalent to taking the Laplace transform of the initial value of an American put option. In that case, the solution of the related free-boundary problem can be derived in a closed form. Hou, Little and Pant [10] have established a new representation for the American put option and proposed an efficient numerical algorithm for solving the corresponding nonlinear integral equation for the optimal exercise boundary. Pedersen and Peskir [20] (see also [6]-[7]) have used the backward induction method and simple time discretization of the nonlinear integral equation for obtaining the optimal stopping boundary. Kolodko and Schoenmakers [15] presented a policy iteration method for computing the optimal Bermudan stopping time. In recent years, Monte Carlo based methods have become rather popular (see e.g. Rogers [25], Haugh and Kogan [9], and Glasserman [8] for an overview). In [1] an iterative Monte-Carlo procedure has been proposed which makes use of the earlier exercise premium representation for American and Bermudan options. The method of [1] can be considered as an analogue to the classical Picard iteration method applied for the proof of existence of solutions of integral equations (cf. e.g. Tricomi [31]) having the advantage that it allows to obtain an upper bound for the value function from a lower one and the lower bound from an upper one. In this paper, we propose a modification of this method, which employees along with the expected reward at the finite time horizon the value function and the stopping boundary of the corresponding perpetual optimal stopping problem (see also Shiryaev et al. [28], Shiryaev [30], Novikov and Shiryaev [19]). Moreover, the convergence of the new algorithm under some regularity conditions is established and the rates of convergence are obtained.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we give a formulation of a finite horizon optimal stopping problem for one-dimensional diffusion processes with a general gain function and discuss different forms of the analogues of EEP representation. In Section 3, we construct a simple time discretization of the corresponding integral equation and propose a numerical iteration procedure for solving it, which produces in each step lower or upper bounds for the solution and arrives at it in a finite number of steps. We stress that as opposite to the backward induction, in each step the procedure delivers an approximation on the whole time interval and not only for the several last time intervals. The main results of the paper are formulated in Lemma 3 and Theorem 4. In Section 4, we illustrate the action of this method on the problems of pricing early exercise American put and Asian options in Black-Scholes models as well as on the finite horizon Bayesian sequential testing and disorder detection problems for Wiener processes. We conclude the paper by pointing out some related open problems.

2 Formulation of the problem

In this section we recall general results from [29], [12] and [20] (see also [17], [14], [11], [4] and [22]) and formulate the problem of estimating the value function of an optimal stopping problem in a one-dimensional diffusion model with finite time horizon.
2.1. For a precise formulation of the finite horizon optimal stopping problem for diffusion processes, let us consider a probability space (, F, Q) with a standard Brownian motion B = (Bt)0tT started at zero. Suppose that the process X = (Xt)0tT solves the stochastic differential equation:

dXt = µ(Xt) dt + (Xt) dBt (X0 = x)

(2.1)

where x  E is a given number from the connected state space E  R of

the process X . Here µ(x) is a drift and (x) > 0 for x  E is a diffusion

coefficient.

In the present paper we consider the problem of computing the value func-

tion:

V (t, x) = sup Et,x e- G(t + , Xt+ )
0 T -t

(2.2)

where the supremum is taken over all stopping times  of the process X (i.e.
with respect to the natural filtration (Ft+u)0uT -t generated by the process (Xt+u)0uT -t ). Here Et,x denotes the expectation with respect to the initial measure Qt,x when the process (Xt+u)0uT -t starts at Xt = x for some x  E , and  > 0 is a discounting factor.
Throughout the paper we assume that the gain function G(t, x) satisfies
some regularity conditions (see [32], [12] and [20]) implying the existence of a
strictly decreasing continuous function b(t) such that the first passage time:

b = inf{0  u  T - t | Xt+u  b(t + u)} = inf{0  u  T - t | V (t + u, Xt+u)  G(t + u, Xt+u)}

(2.3)

is optimal and the value function (2.2) admits the following representation which is called early exercise premium representation in the case of American option problems:

T -t

V (t, x) = e-(T -t) Et,x G(T, XT ) -

e-u Et,x H(t + u, Xt+u)

0

× I(Xt+u  b(t + u)) du

T -t

= e-(T -t) Et,x G(T, XT ) -

e-u Et,x H(t + u, Xt+u)

0

× I(V (t + u, Xt+u)  G(t + u, Xt+u) du

(2.4)

where

H(t, x) = (Gt + µ(x)Gx + (2(x)/2)Gxx - G)(t, x)

(2.5)

3

for all (t, x)  [0, T ] × E and I( · ) denotes the indicator function. Among the regularity conditions mentioned above we refer the following:

(t, x)  G(t, x) is C1,2 on [0, T ] × E x  H(t, x) is decreasing on E for each 0  t  T t  H(t, x) is decreasing on [0, T ] for each x  E

(2.6) (2.7) (2.8)

(cf. Theorem 4.3, Propositions 4.4 and 4.5 in [12]). Note that the problem (2.2) turns out to be non-trivial if there exists a continuous function a(t) such that:

H(t, x) > 0 for x  E such that x < a(t) H(t, x) = 0 for x  E such that x = a(t) H(t, x) < 0 for x  E such that x > a(t)

(2.9) (2.10) (2.11)

hold for all (t, x)  [0, T ] × E . Then it follows by applying It^o's formula that a(t) < b(t) for all 0 < t < T . Following the lines of [20], in the sequel we assume that conditions (2.6)-(2.11) hold. Further conditions on the functions G(t, x) and H(t, x) will be imposed below.
It is also known (see [20], [14] and [11]-[12]) that the stopping boundary b(t) of the finite horizon optimal stopping problem (2.2) solves the nonlinear integral equation:

G(t, b(t)) = e-(T -t) Et,b(t) G(T, XT )

(2.12)

T -t
- e-u Et,b(t) H(t + u, Xt+u) I(Xt+u  b(t + u)) du
0

for all 0  t  T and x  E . By using the change-of-variable formula with local times on curves (see [21]), it was proven in [20] (see also [22]-[24] and [6]-[7]) that the equation (2.12) admits a unique solution. Note that the nonlinear integral equation (2.4) is preferable over the equation (2.12), which involves the optimal stopping boundary since it allows a clear generalization to the multidimensional case. Generally, the equations (2.4) and (2.12) cannot be solved in an explicit form and numerical methods have to be used.

2.2. By means of standard arguments based on the strong Markov property it can be shown that the arbitrage-free price (2.2) solves the following parabolic free-boundary problem (see [17]):

(Vt + µ(x)Vx + (2(x)/2)Vxx)(t, x) = V (t, x) for x  E, V (t, x) x=b(t) = G(t, x) x=b(t) (instantaneous stopping) Vx(t, x) x=b(t) = Gx(t, x) x=b(t) (smooth fit) V (t, x) > G(t, x) for x  E such that x < b(t) V (t, x) = G(t, x) for x  E such that x > b(t)

x < b(t) (2.13) (2.14)
(2.15)
(2.16) (2.17)

where the condition (2.14) is satisfied for all 0  t  T and the condition (2.15) is satisfied for all 0  t < T .

4

Note that the superharmonic characterization of the value function (see [5] and [29]) implies that (2.2) is the smallest function satisfying (2.13)-(2.14) and (2.16)-(2.17).
2.3. Let us denote by V (t, x) and b(t) the value function and the stopping boundary of the related infinite horizon optimal stopping problem defined by (2.2)-(2.3) under T = . In the sequel, we will consider only the optimal stopping problems such that V (t, x) = V (x) and b(t) = b holds for all 0  t  T and x  E . Moreover, we will assume that the limit:

G(x)

=

lim
T 

e-(T -t)

Et,x

G(T, XT )

exists and is finite.

(2.18)

Then, letting T tend to infinity in (2.4) and (2.12), we obtain:

V (x) = G(x) - = G(x) -



e-u Et,x H(t + u, Xt+u) I(Xt+u  b) du

(2.19)

0



e-u Et,x H(t + u, Xt+u) I(V (Xt+u)  G(t + u, Xt+u) du

and

G(t, b) = G(b)

(2.20)


- e-u Et,b H(t + u, Xt+u) I(V (Xt+u)  G(t + u, Xt+u) du
0

for all 0  t  T and x  E , where the functions V (x) and the number b are uniquely determined by the equations (2.19) and (2.20), respectively.
From the formulas (2.4) and (2.19) it follows that:



V (t, x) = V (t, x) -

e-u Et,x H(t + u, Xt+u)

0

× I(b(t + u)  Xt+u > b) du

T -t

= V (t, x) -

e-u Et,x H(t + u, Xt+u)

0

× I(V (t + u, Xt+u)  G(t + u, Xt+u) < V (Xt+u) du

(2.21)

where we set:

V (t, x) = V (t, x) + e-(T -t) Et,x G(T, XT )

- e-u Et,x H(t + u, Xt+u) I(Xt+u  b)
T -t

(2.22)

for all 0  t  T and x  E . The expressions (2.4) and (2.21) serve as the basis
for our algorithm. Note that (2.21) has an advantage over (2.4), since it involves
probabilities of Xt belonging to a bounded intervals which are numerically easier to compute by using Monte Carlo methods than those for unbounded intervals.

3 Main results and proofs

In this section, we approximate the initial model by discretizing the integral equation (2.21) and propose an iteration procedure which solves the discretized integral equation in a finite number of steps. We prove uniform convergence of this solution to the initial value function as the discretization becomes finer and determine the rate of convergence.

3.1. In order to construct an approximation for the equation (2.21), let us
fix some arbitrary 0  t  T and n  N and introduce a partition of the time
interval [0, T - t] . Let u0 = 0 and ui = in with n = (T - t)/n implying that ui - ui-1 = n for every i = 1, . . . , n . Taking into account the structure
of the expression (2.21), let us define the approximation Vn(t + u, x) for the price V (t + u, x) as a solution of the equation:

n

Vn(t + u, x) = V (t + u, x) -

e-ui Et+u,x H (t + ui, Xt+ui )

i= un/(T -t)

× I(bn(t + ui)  Xt+ui > b) n

n

= V (t + u, x) -

e-ui Et+u,x H (t + ui, Xt+ui )

i= un/(T -t)

(3.1)

× I(Vn(t + ui, Xt+ui )  G(t + ui, Xt+ui ) < V (Xt+ui ) n

where the estimate bn(t+u) for the boundary b(t+u) is defined as the maximum
of the intersection curve of Vn(t + u, x) with G(t + u, x) and the perpetual stopping boundary b. Here z denotes the largest integer part of a positive number z > 0. It is clear that the equation (3.1) has a unique solution which can be obtained by means of backward induction in a finite number of steps. This implies that the (piecewise constant) function Vn(t+u, x) is uniquely determined by (3.1) for all 0  u  T - t and x  E . Let us set Vn0(t + u, x) = G(t + u, x) and define the function Vn1(t + u, x) by the formula:

n

Vn1(t + u, x) = V (t + u, x) -

e-ui Et+u,x H(t + ui, Xt+ui ) (3.2)

i= un/(T -t)

× I(Vn0(t + ui, Xt+ui )  G(t + ui, Xt+ui ) < V (Xt+ui ) n

and the function Vn2(t + u, x) by the formula:

n

Vn2(t + u, x) = V (t + u, x) -

e-ui Et+u,x H(t + ui, Xt+ui ) (3.3)

i= un/(T -t)

× I(Vn1(t + ui, Xt+ui )  G(t + ui, Xt+ui ) < V (Xt+ui ) n

for all 0  u  T - t , x  E such that Vn2(t + u, x)  Vn0(t + u, x) , and Vn2(t + u, x) = Vn0(t + u, x) elsewhere. Let us now define sequentially the functions

6

Vnm(t + u, x) for every m  N , m  3 by the formula:

n

Vnm(t + u, x) = V (t + u, x) -

e-ui Et+u,x H(t + ui, Xt+ui ) (3.4)

i= un/(T -t)

× I(Vnm-1(t + ui, Xt+ui )  G(t + ui, Xt+ui ) < V (Xt+ui ) n

for all 0  u  T - t and x  E .

Remark 1 It is easily seen from (3.1) that, by construction in (3.2)-(3.4), we have:
Vn2k-1(t + u, x)  Vn(t + u, x) for 0  u  T - t, x  E, k  N (3.5)
where the sequence (Vn2k-1(t + u, x))kN is monotone decreasing, and
Vn2k(t + u, x)  Vn(t + u, x) for 0  u  T - t, x  E, k  N. (3.6)
where the sequence (Vn2k(t + u, x))kN is monotone increasing for each 0  u  T - t , x  E and every n  N fixed. Moreover, any lower estimate Vn2k-2(t + u, x) for Vn(t + u, x) produces the upper one Vn2k-1(t + u, x) , and any upper estimate Vn2k-1(t + u, x) produces the lower one Vn2k(t + u, x) for each 0  u  T - t , x  E and every k  N .
Remark 2 For every m < n the function u  Vnm(t + u, x) is an estimate for Vn(t + u, x) on the whole interval [0, T - t] for each 0  t  T and x  E fixed. This fact shows the advantage of the proposed method over the standard backward induction.

3.2. Let us now show that the sequence of functions (Vnm(t + u, x))kN from (3.2)-(3.4) converges to the function Vn(t+u, x) in n steps for all 0  u  T -t , x  E and every n  N .

Lemma 3 For each 0  t  T fixed we have Vnm(t + u, x) = Vn(t + u, x) for all 0  u  T - t and x  E and for every m  n .

Proof. Let us fix some 0  t  T and n  N . Then, by construction of Vnm(t + u, x) in (3.2)-(3.4), the equalities:

n

Vn2k+1(t + u, x) - Vn2k(t + u, x) = -

e-ui Et+u,x H (t + ui, Xt+ui )

i= un/(T -t)

× I(Vn2k(t + ui, Xt+ui )  G(t + ui, Xt+ui ) < Vn2k-1(t + ui, Xt+ui )) n (3.7)

7

and

n

Vn2k+2(t + u, x) - Vn2k+1(t + u, x) = -

e-ui Et+u,x H (t + ui, Xt+ui )

i= un/(T -t)

× I(Vn2k(t + ui, Xt+ui )  G(t + ui, Xt+ui ) < Vn2k+1(t + ui, Xt+ui )) n (3.8)

are satisfied for all 0  u  T - t and x  E and for every k  N .
In order to prove the desired assertion, we should use the mathematical induction principle. First, we note that Vnm(T, x) = G(T, x) for all x  E and m  N . For checking the induction basis, it is enough to observe that if m = 2k
with k = 0 then (3.8) implies the equality:

Vn2(t + u, x) - Vn1(t + u, x) = -e-un Et+u,x H(t + un, Xt+un )

(3.9)

× I(Vn0(t + un, Xt+un )  G(t + un, Xt+un ) < Vn1(t + un, Xt+un )) n = 0

which holds for all (n - 1)(T - t)/n  u  T - t , where we have t + un = T by definition of the partition.

3.3. We now prove that the solution of the discretized equation (3.1) converges to V (t + u, x) uniformly on [0, T - t] as n tends to infinity. For this, let us further denote:

F (t, x; t + u, y) = Et,x H(t + u, Xt+u) I(Xt+u  y) for all 0  u  T - t and x, y  E .

(3.10)

Theorem 4 Suppose that the conditions (2.6)-(2.11) and (2.18) are satisfied. Assume that the function:

x  G(t, x) is monotone and convex on E with |Gx(t, x)|   (3.11) for some  > 0 and the function:

y  F (t, x; t + u, y) is C1 on E

(3.12)

and

|Fy(t, x; t + u, y)|  Cu

(3.13)

holds for all 0  t  T , 0 < u  T - t and x, y  E and some C > 0. Let Vn(t + u, x) be a solution of the discretized equation (3.1). Then there exists
some t  [0, T ] close enough to T such that the sequence (Vn(t + u, x))nN converges to V (t + u, x) uniformly for 0  u  T - t and x  E with the rate 1/n when n tends to infinity.

Proof. First, we observe that the representations (2.4) and (3.1) imply:

for n  N and C1 > 0 fixed. As to the second term in (3.14), we can make use of the mean value theorem and the inequality (3.13) to get:

F (t, x; t + ui, b(t + ui)) - F (t, x; t + ui, bn(t + ui))

(3.16)

= Fy(t, x; t + ui, i) bn(t + ui) - b(t + ui)  Cui bn(t + ui) - b(t + ui)

for some i  E and every i = 1, . . . , n . From the assumption (2.6), by mean value theorem it follows that:

G(t + ui, b(t + ui)) - G(t + ui, b(t + ui)) = Gx(t + ui, i) bn(t + ui) - b(t + ui)

(3.17)

for some i  E and every i = 1, . . . , n . Then, using (3.17) and taking into account (3.11), from (3.16) it follows that:

F (t, x; t + ui, b(t + ui)) - F (t, x; t + ui, b(t + ui))
 Cui G(t + ui, bn(t + ui)) - G(t + ui, b(t + ui)) = Cui Vn(t + ui, bn(t + ui)) - V (t + ui, b(t + ui))  Cui Vn(t + ui, xi) - V (t + ui, xi)

(3.18)

for some xi  E such that xi  (bn(t)  b(t), bn(t)  b(t)) . Hence, combining (3.14)-(3.18), we get:

(3.23)

for all n  N such that n  N . This completes the proof of the theorem.

3.4. In principle, one could construct directly the estimate for the value
function (2.2) without use of discretization by the following iterative scheme. Let us set V 0(t, x) = G(t, x) and define the function V 1(t, x) by the formula:

T -t

V 1(t, x) = V (t, x) -

e-u Et,x H(t + u, Xt+u)

(3.24)

0

× I(V 0(t + u, Xt+u)  G(t + u, Xt+u) < V (Xt+u) du

and the function Vn2(t, x) by the formula:

T -t

V 2(t, x) = V (t, x) -

e-u Et,x H(t + u, Xt+u)

(3.25)

× I(V 1(t + u, Xt+u)  G(t + u, Xt+u) < V (Xt+u) du

for all 0  t  T , x  E such that V 2(t, x)  V 0(t, x) , and V 2(t, x) = V 0(t, x) elsewhere. Let us now define sequentially the functions V m(t, x) for every m 
N , m  3 by the formula:

T -t

V m(t, x) = V (t, x) -

e-u Et,x H(t + u, Xt+u)

0

× I(V m-1(t + u, Xt+u)  G(t + u, Xt+u) < V (Xt+u) du

for all 0  t  T and x  E .

Remark 5 Again, by the construction, we have:

V 2k-1(t, x)  V (t, x) for 0  t  T, x  E, k  N

(3.27)

where the sequence (V 2k-1(t, x))kN is monotone decreasing, and V 2k(t, x)  V (t, x) for 0  t  T, x  E, k  N.

(3.28)

where the sequence (V 2k(t, x))kN is monotone increasing for each 0  t  T , x  E and every n  N fixed. Moreover, any lower estimate V 2k-2(t, x) for V (t, x) produces the upper one V 2k-1(t, x) , and any upper estimate V 2k-1(t, x) produces the lower one V 2k(t, x) for each 0  t  T , x  E and every k  N . The question of convergence of the sequence (V m(t, x))mN to the value function
V (t, x) for each 0  t  T , x  E is left open here.

4 Examples
In this section we give some remarks on the application of the iterative procedure introduced above to solving nonlinear integral equations arising from some optimal stopping problems with finite time horizon.

Example 6 (Early exercise American put option [17], [22]). Suppose that in (2.2) we have G(t, x) = (K - x)+ and  = r for some K, r > 0 fixed. Assume
that in (2.1) we have µ(x) = rx , (x) = x for x  E = (0, ) and some
 > 0, and hence H(t, x) = -rK in (2.5). In this case, as an analogue of the
formula (3.10), we have:

F (0, x; t, y) = -rK P0,x Xt  y

Thus, the

conditions (3.11)-(3.13) as well as the other essential assumptions of Theorem

4 are satisfied (see [2]).

Example 7 (Early exercise Asian option [24], [16]). Suppose that in (2.2) we have G(t, x) = (1 - x/t)+ and  = 0 . Assume that in (2.1) we have
µ(x) = (1 - rx) , (x) = x for all x  E = (0, ) and some r,  > 0 , and
hence H(t, x) = ((1/t + r)x - 1)/t in (2.5). In this case, as an analogue of the
formula (3.10), we have:

F (0, x; t, y) = E0,x H(t, x) I(Xt  y)

Example 8 (Bayesian Wiener sequential testing problem with finite horizon [29; Chapter IV, Section 3], [6]). Suppose that in (2.2) we have G(t, x) = -t - ax  b(1 - x) for some a, b > 0 fixed and  = 0 . Assume that in (2.1) we have µ(x) = 0 , (x) = x(1 - x) for all x  E = (0, 1) and some  > 0, and hence H(t, x) = 1 in (2.5). In this case, as an analogue of the formula (3.10), we have:

F (0, x; t, y) = P0,x Xt  y = x  1 log t

(4.4)

for all t > 0 and x, y  (0, 1) . Thus, it can be verified that the conditions (3.11)(3.13) as well as the other essential assumptions of Theorem 4 are satisfied.

Example 9 (Wiener disorder detection problem with finite horizon [29; Chapter IV, Section 4], [7]). Suppose that in (2.2) we have G(t, x) = -(1 - x) and  = 0 . Assume that in (2.1) we have µ(x) = (1 - x) , (x) = x(1 - x) for all x  E = (0, 1) and some ,  > 0 . The reward of the related optimal stopping problem contains also an integral and thus, as an analogue of the formula (3.10), we have:

F (0, x; t, y) = E0,x Xt I(Xt  y) + (1 - Xt) I(Xt  y)

for all t > 0 and x, y  (0, 1) , where an explicit expression for the marginal density function p is derived in [7; Section 4]. It can be verified that the conditions (3.11)-(3.13) as well as the other essential assumptions of Theorem 4 are satisfied (see [7]).

Example 10 (Early exercise Russian option [26]-[27], [23]). Suppose that in (2.2) we have G(t, x) = x . Assume that in (2.1) we have:

dXt = -rXt dt + Xt dBt + dRt (X0 = x)

and St = exp(Bt + (r + 2/2)t) for all t  0 and some r,  > 0 , and hence H(t, x) = -(r + )x for all x  E = (0, ) in (2.5). In this case, as an

analogue of the formula (3.10) we have:

for 0 < s  m and m  1 with  = r/ + /2 . Thus, it can be shown that in this case the condition (3.13) is not satisfied. This can be explained by the fact that there is a reflection term (4.7) in the equation (4.6). Therefore, one should find another arguments to prove the assertion of Theorem 4 for this case.
