Abstract. We prove that the global game selection in all 3 × 3 payoff-symmetric supermodular games is independent of the noise structure. As far as we know, all other proofs of noise independence of such games rely on the existence of a so-called monotone potential (MP) maximiser. Our result is more general, since some 3 × 3 symmetric supermodular games do not admit an MP maximiser. Moreover, a corollary is that noise independence does not imply the existence of an MP maximiser. Keywords: global game, noise independence, strategic complementarities, supermodular game JEL codes: C72, D82.
1. Introduction Global games are often used to select a unique equilibrium in models that would typically have multiple equilibria. There are many applications, particularly to the theory of financial crises (see Morris and Shin (2003) for an overview). In this note, we prove that in two-player, three-action, supermodular games with symmetric payoffs this global game selection is independent of the noise structure when the noise vanishes (see Frankel, Morris, and Pauzner (2003) (FMP) for the definition of global games used here). Games with this property are called noise independent.
Theorem. Every 3 × 3 symmetric supermodular game is noise independent.
The significance of this result is in its implication that 3×3 games clarify the connections between the noise independence of global games, robustness to incomplete information (Kajii and Morris, 1997), and the existence of a monotone potential (MP) maximiser (Morris and Ui, 2005). As far as we know, all proofs of the noise independence of (subclasses of) supermodular games so far rely on the existence of an MP maximiser. Existence of an MP maximiser guarantees

existence of an equilibrium robust to incomplete information (Morris and Ui, 2005), and a fortiori, noise independence (Oury and Tercieux, 2007; Basteck, Danie¨ls, and Heinemann, 2010). The noise independence of 3 × 3 symmetric supermodular games with three Nash equilibria can be proved along these lines, see Oyama and Takahashi (2009). However, Honda (2010) has found a non-empty open set of 3 × 3 symmetric supermodular games, with two Nash equilibria, that have no MP maximiser. Oyama and Takahashi (2011) show that these games have no equilibrium robust to incomplete information either.
Our proof of their noise independence does not rely on the existence of an MP maximiser. Since it applies to all 3 × 3 games with symmetric payoffs, it is necessarily more general. In particular, combined with the results of Honda and Oyama and Takahashi, it shows that noise independence is not equivalent to the existence of an MP maximiser, nor to the existence of an equilibrium robust to incomplete information.
Carlsson and Van Damme (1993), who introduced global games, established the noise independence of all 2 × 2 games. FMP investigated the noise independence of 3 × 3 symmetric supermodular games. The cases of noise independence that FMP formally consider rely on the existence of an MP maximiser.1 But they also give a heuristic argument for the noise independence of 3 × 3 games with symmetric payoffs when, in addition, the noise distributions of players' signals are symmetric in the mean. Unfortunately, in general it is not true2 that if the global game selection is independent of the noise structure for all mean-symmetric noise distributions, the game is noise independent in general, as we show below per counter example.

2. Preliminaries

Consider a 3 × 3 game g with players i  I = {1, 2}, both endowed with ordered action set

A = {a, b, c}, a < b < c and payoff function gi : A × A  R, where gi(ai, a-i) is i's payoff if she chooses ai and her opponent a-i. We will typically denote an action profile (a, a)  A × A also by a, economising slightly on notation.

Let

difference

of

playing

instead

of

against

an opposing action x-i and recall that g is called (weakly) supermodular if3

A

game

g

is

called

strictly

supermodular if (1) still holds when the weak inequality is replaced by a strict one. The dual

game of g, denoted g, is obtained by reversing the ordering on A. Note that g is supermodular if

and only if g is supermodular.

To establish the noise independence of g while avoiding having to deal with sequences of global

games with increasingly precise signals, we will define a new family of incomplete information

games that allow us to establish the global game selection more directly. We will first give their

definition and then discuss their intuition and the way we use them.

Let

f

=

( f1,

f2) denote a pair

of probability

densities, whose

supports

are

subsets

of

[-

1 2

,

1 2

].

For each f we define the game e(g, f ) as follows. A state parameter  is drawn uniformly from

1More specifically, they rely on the existence of a Local Potential (LP) maximiser, which implies the existence of an
MP maximiser in own-action concave games (Morris and Ui, 2005; Oyama and Takahashi, 2009). 2Nor, we should add, do FMP claim this is true. 3FMP use the terminology "game of strategic complementarities".

the

interval

[-

1 2

,

8].

Each

player

receives

a

signal

xi

=



+

i

about

the

true

state,

with

i

drawn

according to the density fi. The random variables , 1, 2 are independently distributed. Players'

payoffs ui, i  {1, 2}, are given by

ui(ai,

a-i,

xi)

:=

u~(ai, a-i) gi(ai, a-i)

if xi < 0, if xi  0,

where u~ is an arbitrary payoff function such that the least action dominates all others, say for all a-i, u~(ai, a-i) = 0 if ai  {b, c} and u~(ai, a-i) = 1 if ai = a.

A strategy profile s is a function that associates an action for each player with each pair of signals. We say a strategy profile s in e(g, f ) attains a  A × A if s(x)  a for some pair of signals x. An action profile a  A × A is said to be attained from below under f if the greatest equilibrium strategy profile of e(g, f ) attains a. (As is usual, strategy profiles are ordered pointwise. The supermodularity of g guarantees the existence of a greatest equilibrium strategy profile). If s is a strategy profile, and (s) the greatest best reply to s, we can conduct upper-best reply iterations s, (s), ((s)), (((s))), . . . starting at some strategy profile s. If (s) is weakly greater
than s, the resulting sequence of strategy profiles will be monotonically increasing, due to the supermodularity of g. As the strategy space is bounded, this sequence converges pointwise to an
equilibrium strategy profile, weakly smaller than the greatest equilibrium strategy profile.

Intuitively, the game e(g, f ) resembles a global game with arbitrarily precise signals drawn from a scaled down version of f : after receiving their signal, players know the true payoff function and use their signals to form beliefs about the actions that others may choose. FMP use an analogous construction in the proof of their theorem 4, and it is related to the "elaborations" of Kajii and Morris (1997). The connection with global games is further formalised in (Basteck, Danie¨ls, and Heinemann, 2010), where we use this construction to prove the following characterisation of the global game selection.
Let G(v) be a global game, with noise structure f up to the usual scaling parameter v, such that its payoff structure equals that of g at some payoff parameter . As v  0, the action profile a is the greatest global game selection at  if, and only if, a is the greatest action profile attained from below under f in e(g, f ). Dually, a is the least global game selection at  if and only if it is the greatest action profile attained from below under f of the dual game g. The greatest and least global game selection almost always coincide.

3. Proof of Noise Independence of 3 × 3 Symmetric Supermodular Games
Now suppose g is a symmetric game, so that we may write g := g1 = g2 and  := 1 = 2. We will prove g is noise independent. We may assume without loss of generality that g is strictly supermodular, 4 and that no action strictly dominates another (that would imply that g can be
4If g is not strictly supermodular, we may embed it in a global game G(v) where the payoff structure is symmetric and strictly supermodular almost everywhere. For instance, identify a = -1, b = 0, c = 1 and consider the global game where payoffs depend on a state variable  as follows:
ui(ai, a-i, ) := g(ai, a-i) + ai(2 + sgn()a-i).
One may verify that g(ai, a-i) = u(ai, a-i, ) for  = 0 and that u satisfies the requirements of a global game as stated by FMP. By results in (Basteck, Danie¨ls, and Heinemann, 2010), the global game selection in g does not depend on the embedding chosen. Since the greatest (least) global game selection is continuous in  from the right (left), and noise independent at almost all  by our proof below, the global game selection for g is independent of the noise structure as well.

reduced to a 2 × 2 game known to be noise independent). Then, by supermodularity, both a and c must be equilibria.

Consider a strategy in the mixed extension of g that mixes over the actions a, b, c with probabilities ("weights") wa, wb, wc. Define S (wc) to be the number wa that solves the equation

(2) wag(b, a) + (1 - wa - wc)g(b, b) + wcg(b, c) = wag(c, a) + (1 - wa - wc)g(c, b) + wcg(c, c).

Even though S (wc) is not necessarily in the interval [0, 1], we can think of it intuitively as the weight that may be put on the least action, a, to make the opposing player indifferent between

playing the middle action, b, and the greatest action, c, when the weight on c is wc. Existence

and uniqueness of the solution S (wc) are guaranteed by strict supermodularity. The function S

has derivative

S

:=

bc(c) - cb(b) bc(b) - bc(a)

>

0,

thus is linear and (due to supermodularity) increasing. Analogously, define N(wa) to be the

minimal weight that needs to be put on c to make the opposing player indifferent between playing

a and b when the weight on a is wa. That is, N(wa) is the solution wc that solves

(3) wag(a, a) + (1 - wa - wc)g(a, b) + wcg(a, c) = wag(b, a) + (1 - wa - wc)g(b, b) + wcg(b, c).

The function N has derivative

Proof. Fix f . We will show that there exists an increasing strategy profile s in e(g, f ) that attains c, and such that s  (s). In this case, c must be the global game selection.

First observe that any increasing strategy profile can be represented by the threshold signals at

which

players

switch

to

actions.

For

strategy

profile,

let

the

threshold where player i switches from a to b, and zi is the threshold at which she switches from

If

all threshold

signals are

within

[0,

1 2

],

we may deduce the following weights from H, which are straightforward to verify. If player 2

receives the signal z2, she assigns weight

wc(z2|z1) := P(x1  z1|x2 = z2) = P(x1 - x2  z1 - z2|x2 = z2) = 1 - H(z1 - z2)

to player 1 playing c. Player 1 at x1 = z1 assigns weight wc(z1|z2) := H(z1 - z2) = 1 - wc(z2|z1)

to player 2 playing c. In a similar vein, at z2, Player 2 assigns weight wa(z2|z1) := H(z1 - z2) to

player

1

playing

a.

At

player

1

assigns

weight

wa(z1|z2)

:=

-

H(z 1

z) 2

to

playing

wa(z1|z2)

:=

1

-

H(z1

-

z) 2

=:

wc(z2|z1).

If (I) holds, it is easy to verify the existence of the strategy profile s. Simply set z1 = z2 =

z1 = z2 = 0.

If (II) holds, it suffices to show that c is the global game selection in games where one of the

inequalities

()

N

(

)



S

(

)

or

()

S

(

)

is

binding.

Any

game

g

where

the

inequalities

are

strict can be changed into a game g where one of the inequalities becomes binding by lowering

the payoffs from playing action c by some constant. Lowering the payoffs from c does not change

the property that b is a best reply to µca, so (II) holds in both g and g . Then, if we can show that the greatest equilibrium strategy profile in the game e(g , f ) attains c, the same must be true in

the original game.

Now consider the set M of all increasing strategy profiles satisfying: (i) at z2, b or c is a best reply for player 2; and (ii) at z2, c is a best reply for player 2; and (iii) z1 player 1 weakly prefers
to play c over b (we do not make any assumptions concerning the expected payoff from playing

a);

and

(iv)

z 1

=

1.

Note that due to supermodularity, if s satisfies (i)-(iii), decreasing z2 preserves (ii) and (iii);

decreasing z2 preserves (i) and (iii), and decreasing z1 preserves (i) and (ii).

Claim

1:

The

set

M

is

nonempty.

To

see

this,

first

consider

case

(),

S

(

1 2

)

=

0.

Set

z2

=

2,

z1 = z2 = 3. At each zi, players face an opponent mixing equally over b and c and are therefore

indifferent between b and c. At z2, player 2 faces an opponent who plays b with probability 1 and

will

strictly

prefer

b

over

a

as

N(0)

<

N

(

1 2

)



S

(

1 2

)

=

0.

Next,

consider

case

(),

N

(

1 2

)

=

S

(

1 2

).

Set z1 = z2 = 3 and choose z2  [2, 3] such that player 1 is indifferent between b and c at z1. To

see

that

this

is

always

possible,

note

that

player

1

would

prefer

b

at

z1

if

we

would

set

z 2

=

3,

as

b

is

a

best

reply

against

µac .

Also,

she

would

prefer

c

at

z1

if

we

would

set

z2

=

2

as

S

(

1 2

)



0.

Thus

we may satisfy (iii). Under the resulting profile s, player 2's best reply at z2 is c, since she faces

an

opponent

that

mixes

over

b

and

c

with

probability

1 2

,

thus

(ii)

is

satisfied.

For

player

1,

we

have

wc(z1|z2)

=

1 2

and

since

she

is

indifferent

between

b

and

c,

we

know

that

wa(z1|z2)

=

S

(

1 2

).

As z2  2, we know that player 2 at the threshold z2 puts weight wa(z2|z1) = 0 on her opponent

playing

a.

In

addition,

wc(z2|z1)

=

wa(z1|z2)

=

S

(

1 2

)

=

N

(

1 2

)

>

N(0)

so

that

she

strictly

prefers

b

over a, and this means (i) is satisfied, and our claim is proved.

Claim 2: The set M has a maximal element. Let C be any chain, i.e. linearly ordered subset, of M. Construct a strategy profile s by setting each of the thresholds z1, z2, z1, z2 to the infimum of the corresponding thresholds of the strategy profiles in C. To see that s  M, consider an increasing, countable subsequence s0  s1  s2 . . . of C converging pointwise to s. The inequalities on expected payoff implied by (i)-(iii) are satisfied for each sn, so are satisfied for
the limit point s by the dominated convergence theorem. Clearly then, s is a least upper bound for C in M. Since C was arbitrary, M has a maximal element by Zorn's lemma. This proves
our claim.

Choose s to be a maximal element of M. We will prove that player 1 weakly prefers b over a
at the threshold z1 = 1 in s. Since s satisfies (i)-(iv), this means s  (s), and the proof of the lemma is complete.

We begin by examining the preferences at the other three thresholds. First, if player 1 strictly prefers c over b at z1, then it must be that z1 = 1 = z1--otherwise s would not be a maximal element. Yet if z1 = 1 = z1, we arrive at a contradiction as follows. Player 2 must be indifferent between a and b at z2  1, as b is a best reply to the opposing mixed strategy profile µac at signal x2 = 1. Similarly, z2  1. But then either

contradicting the fact that wa(z1|z2) = wc(z2|z1). Thus we conclude that player 1 is indifferent

between b and c at z1.

Next, if player 2 would strictly prefer a over b at z2 then she would have to be indifferent

between

a

and

c

at

z 2

=

z2

=:

z2.

Since

b

is

a

best

reply

for

player

1

against

the

belief

µac ,

and

player 1 is indifferent at z1, we find that z2  z1. Also, we have that z1  z2, as otherwise at z2

player 2 would face an opposing action distribution that is dominated by µac, so that her best reply

would be weakly smaller than b. But then we arrive at the following contradiction:

wc(z2|z1)

<

N(wa

(z2

|z )) 1



N

(

1 2

)



S

(

1 2

)



S

(wc(z1|z2))

=

wa(z1|z2)

=

wc(z2|z1).

Finally, if player 2 would strictly prefer c over b at z2, maximality of s would imply that she is

indifferent between a and c at z2 = z2 = z2, and hence strictly prefers a over b at z2, which we have just ruled out.

In sum, in the strategy profile s, each player i is indifferent between b and c at zi and player

2 is indifferent between a and b at z2. Then, by definition, we have S (wc(z1|z2)) = wa(z1|z2)

and

N(wa(z2|z1))

=

wc(z2|z1).

In

addition,

it

is

always

the

case

that

wa

(z1

|z 2

)

=

wc(z2|z1),

so

we

conclude that S (wc(z1|z2)) = N(wa(z2|z1)). But then, as

S

(wc(z1|z2)

S

+

1 2

N

= N(wa(z2|z1)).

and

as

S

N

(

1 2

),

we

know

that

(wc(z1|z2) - wc(z2|z1)) S  (wa(z2|z1) - wa(z1|z2)) N.

Returning to the situation of player 1 at z1, we can now say that

N(wa(z1|z2))

=

N

1 2

)

-

1 2

(wa(z2|z1

)

wa(z1|z2))

S

(

-

S

= S (wc(z2|z1)).

Since

we

know

that

player

2

is

indifferent

between

b

and

c

at

z2

and

that

wa

(z2

|z 1

)

=

wc(z1|z2),

we conclude that

N(wa

(z 1

|z )) 2



S

(wc(z2|z1))

=

wa(z2|z1)

=

wc

(z 1

|z2).

But, by the definition of N, this simply says that player 1 weakly prefers b over a at z1, which is what we needed to show.

Corollary. If either (I) a is a best reply to µac, or (II) b is a best reply to µac and in addition both

S

and

N

(

hold,

then

a

is

the

global

game

selection,

for

any

f.

Proof. In the dual game of g, the ordering on A is reversed. Define N and S  for g analogous

to N and S for g, by replacing all the occurrences of a in expressions (2) and (3) by c, and all occurrences of c by a. We find that N = S and similarly S  = N. By our lemma, a is the noise

selection

in

g

in

case

(II),

that

and

S

(

)).

Since

g

and

g differ only in their ordering, a is the noise independent selection in g as well.

If g neither satisfies the conditions of the lemma nor of its corollary, b must be a Nash equilibrium,

since

it

is

a

to

µca

and

both

N

and

S

hold.

In

this

case,

by

results

of

6

Oyama and Takahashi (2009), b is an MP maximiser,5 and therefore the global game selection. This completes the proof that g is noise independent.
Remark. Oyama and Takahashi (2009) provide payoff conditions to find an MP maximiser in a game of three Nash equilibria. They coincide with our conditions to find the global game selection, even when applied to games with less than three Nash equilibria. The conditions given by FMP also coincide with ours, under the additional assumption that b is a best reply to µca.

4. Mean-symmetric noise independence versus noise independence
We say f is mean-symmetric if the induced distribution over signal differences xi - x-i, conditional on xi, is symmetric in the mean.6 We now ask whether, if a game has the property that the global game selection is independent of the noise structure for all mean-symmetric f , that game is noise independent. The answer is no. As symmetric supermodular 3 × 3 games are noise independent, we turn to an asymmetric 3 × 3 game to prove this.

threshold

values

z, 1

z1,

z, 2

z2

such

that

players

hold

the

above mentioned beliefs over opponents play at their respective threshold and are thus indifferent

between the two actions. Thus, a is attained from below under f in g, and c is attained from

below under f in g, and the example is a knife-edge case where a is the least global game

selection and c the greatest.

This is generally no longer possible if the noise distribution is not mean-symmetric and we

will give an example of a distribution of signal differences where c is the global game selection

in g, as well as for slightly perturbed payoffs. Thus, c is the unique global game selection of g.

By perturbing the payoff table slightly, we could create a game where a is the unique global

game selection for any symmetric f , while under our example with non-mean-symmetric f , c

would be the unique global game selection. However, in order to keep our example simple, we

stick to the numbers in figure 1.

Mean-symmetric noise structures. Without loss of generality let us assume that the conditional

densities over the opponents signal are symmetric in 0. Set z1, z2 = 0. Then, upon receiving a

signal

xi

=

0,

both

players

expect

their

opponent

to

play

a

with

probability

1 2

.

Next,

set

z-i

such

that

on

receiving

a

signal

xi

=

0

an

player

expects

his

opponent

to

play

b

with

probability

1 6

and

c

with

probability

1 3

.

Due

to

symmetry,

we

find

that

z1

=

z2

=

t

for

some

t,

so

that

S

(

,

)

over

Thus,

players

will

indeed

be

willing

to

switch to the higher action at each of the thresholds, so that c is attained from below under f ,

and hence the greatest global game selection. In the same way, one can show that a is attained from below under f in e(g, f ), making it part of the global game selection as well.

Non-mean-symmetric noise structures. To gain some intuition, assume a noise structure f

such

that

players

assign

probability

1 2

to

the

event

that

their

opponent

receives

a

signal

smaller

that their own. Set z1 = 0. Adjust z2 such that player 2 is indifferent between a and b at the

threshold: this is the case for z2 = z1 = 0, irrespective of z1, z2. Next, set the zi simultaneously

to a level where both players are indifferent between b and c at their respective thresholds. In

general, and in contrast to a situation with mean-symmetric f , we will find that z1 z2, so the

probability

that

player

2

assigns

to

her

opponent

playing

c

will

be

unequal

to

1 2

.

But

this

implies

that

the

probability

she

assigns

to

player

1

playing

a

will

be

unequal

to

1 3

.

For

player

1

with

signal

z1

=

0

this

implies

that,

while

she

assigns

probability

1 2

to

player

2

playing

a,

she

assigns

probability

unequal

to

1 3

to

player

2

playing

c.

Thus,

she

strictly

prefers

either

a

or

b

so

that

the

global game selection is either a or c, uniquely.

We move on to a numerical example. Consider the following conditional probability density

function of player 1 about player 2's signal:

1(x2|x1)

:=

 

1

x2

+ -

x2 x1

-

x1

if x1 - 1 < x2 < x1, . if x1 < x2 < x1 + 1

Player 2 holds a mirrored version, namely

2(x1|x2)

:=

 

x2

-

x1

1 + x2 -

x1

if x2 - 1 < x1 < x2, . if x2 < x1 < x2 + 1

Set z1 = 0. The smallest value at which player 2 is willing to switch to b is then z2 = 0 at

which

she

expects

player

1

to

play

a

with

probability

1 2

.

By

numerical

methods

we

establish

that

the smallest values zi where players are willing to switch to c are z1 0.2214 and z2 0.5224.

From the perspective of player 1 at z , the probability that her opponent will play c is then

1

approximately

equal

to

0.5

-

0.5(0.5224)2

=

0.3635

>

1 3

while

the

probability

for

action

a

is

1 2

.

Thus, player 1 strictly prefers to play b at her threshold, so that we have found a strategy profile

that attains c, which must be the greatest global game selection. Since player 1 strictly prefers to

switch at z , we could slightly increase all other thresholds, so that both players strictly prefer to 1
play a higher action at each of their thresholds. Slight perturbations of the payoff table would not

alter these strict preferences, implying that c is the unique global game selection. This contrasts

with the case of mean-symmetric f , so we have shown that g is not noise independent.

It may be hard to generate the i's using two independently distributed error terms with densities f1, f2. However, they can be approximated close enough for the numerical result to hold: assume that player 1 receives a very precise signal, while player 2's signal is distributed

around  just like x2 is distributed around x1 according to 1.
