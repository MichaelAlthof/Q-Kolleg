Abstract We analyse a sample of funds and other securities each assigned a total rating score by an unknown expert entity. The scores are based on a number of risk and complexity factors, each assigned a category (factor score) of Low, Medium, or High by the expert entity. A principal component analysis of the data reveals that based on the chosen risk factors alone we cannot identify a single underlying latent source of risk in the data. Conversely, the chosen complexity factors are clearly related to one or two underlying sources of complexity. For the sample we find a clear positive relation between the first principal component and the total expert score. An attempt to match the securities' expert score by linear projection of their individual factor scores yields a best case correlation between expert score and projection of 0.9952. However, the sum of squared differences is, at 46.5552, still notable. JEL classification: C01, G00, G17, G24 Keywords: Credit risk, Principal Components Analysis, Credit Rating Score

1 Introduction

We are provided with a sample of n = 100 funds and other securities that have been assigned a rating score by an unknown expert entity ­ the expert (rating) score in the following. We assume the rating score to depend on a set of six risk factors and five complexity factors, each modelled as random variables on an ordinal scale of Low, Medium, High. The risk factors are volatility, liquidity, credit rating, duration / cash flow, leverage, and diversification degree. The complexity factors comprise of the number of structural layers, expansiveness of derivatives, availability & known pricing models, number of return outcome scenarios, and transparency / ease of understanding. In addition to the rating score, we know the category (i.e. Low, Medium, High) assigned to each factor for any given security included in the sample. Figure 1 and Figure 2 show histograms for each of the risk and complexity factors, respectively.

To get a better impression regarding the relation between individual securities in the sample, we perform cluster analyses based on i) only the risk factors, ii) only the complexity factors, and iii) both risk and complexity factors in the sample. In particular, we apply the Ward clustering algorithm using an Euclidean distance matrix. This algorithm is chosen to ensure that individual clusters are as homogenous as possible. However, other algorithms such as the single linkage or complete linkage algorithms can be applied as well (Ha¨rdle and Simar, 2015, Chapter 12). The results are depicted in Figure 3.

2 Principal Components Analysis of Factor Scores
Principal components analysis (PCA) allows for the identification of uncorrelated latent factors that drive the variation in a sample of multivariate random variables. We consider a random variable Y = (Y1, . . . , Yj, . . . , Yk) with Yj  {Low, M edium, High}, 1  j  k. Y represents a vector of the risk and complexity categories assigned to a security i by the expert entity. To later be able to perform PCA on our sample we assign a discrete scale {1, 2, 3} to each Yj yielding a random variable X = (X1, . . . , Xj, . . . , Xk) with Xj  {1, 2, 3}, 1  j  k (i.e. Yj = High is equivalent to Xj = 3). For easier reference let us refer to each of the Xj as a factor score.
Our sample is now represented by a discrete matrix X  {1, 2, 3}n×k, with each row i representing a security and each column j representing a factor. The element xi,j is therefore security i's score for the j-th factor. We still cannot apply PCA to X directly, however, without violating the basic assumption of normally distributed continuous random variables made in PCA. To circumvent this issue, we apply a discrete PCA using the polychoric correlation matrix of the factor scores (Kolenikov and Angeles, 2009).
Just as the cluster analysis, PCA is performed on three sub-samples of X; XRisk, XComp, and XAll. The number of columns of X therefore depends on the sub-sample (i.e. XRisk is 100 × 6, XComp is 100 × 5, and XAll is 100 × 11). Table 1 shows the resulting projection vectors for the first principal component (PC), P C1. One method of analysing the relation between PCs and the underlying sample is to look at fractions of
4

sample variance explained by each PC. This is possible, because the sum of PC variances matches the

sum of variances of the underlying random variables in a sample (i.e.

k j=1

V

ar[P

Cj ]

=

k j=1

sxj

,xj

).

The fraction of variance explained by each PC can therefore be measured as

V ar[P Cj ]

k j=1

V

ar[P

Cj

]

.

If the

fraction of explained variance for the first one or two PCs is very high, we know that the underlying

random variables are in fact mainly driven by some latent factors represented by those two PCs.

Figure 4 depicts the fractions of sample variance explained by each of the principal components

(PCs).

When only considering risk factors, the sample variance appears to be distributed fairly evenly

among PCs. If we assume risk to be some latent variable that we expect the risk factors to be proxies

of, the finding contradicts this assumption. Instead, the chosen risk factors appear to proxy for various

independent latent factors. The opposite is true for the group of complexity factors, where the first

PC explains more than 60 percent of the sample variation. All remaining PCs each explain less than

20 percent at the most. This reveals that the chosen complexity factors ­ at least in large parts ­

track the same underlying latent complexity factor. When including both risk and complexity factors

in the PCA, the first PC explains around 40 percent of the sample variation and the next three or

four PCs add another 10 to 20 percent each.

In Figure 5 we plot the correlation of each of the risk and complexity factors with the first two

PCs for each of the factor sample subsets. Note that only the absolute correlation value is relevant

when interpreting these correlations because PCs are not determined in their sign. Our results support

the previous discussion regarding the explained sample variance. While the absolute correlation for

risk factors with both P C1 and P C2 range from zero to 1.0 (top left panel), absolute correlations for complexity factors lie clearly within a range from 0.5 to 1.0 with a strong tendency towards higher

values (top right panel). In the bottom left panel we note the absence of a clear correlation pattern

between factors and the first two PCs. With the exception of the "number of structural" layers factor

all complexity factors maintain a strong correlation with P C1. Risk factors deviate very clearly from

their correlations with both PCs in the top left panel.

Figure 6, Figure 7, and Figure 8 plot the first three PCs against each other and show the correlation

matrix eigenvalues associated with each principle component.

Finally, we plot the expert score of each security in the sample against its first PC in Figure 9. As

can be seen there is a clear relation between the total score and the first PC for risk, complexity, and

both risk and complexity factors. This relation is most evident for the latter two groups.

2.1 Cross Validation via Leave-One-Out

The PCA results are cross validated by employing a leave-one-out (LOO) procedure. We compute the first PC for a security i based on weights obtained from a PCA of the sample excluding security i. In Figure 10 we plot the LOO PCs against their regular counterparts. Additionally, we define a function

n
R1 =

f1(xi) - f^1(xi)

2
,

i=1

(1)

where f1(xi) is the first PC for security i resulting from a PCA of the whole sample and f^1(xi) is the first PC for security i computed from the weights of a PCA of the sample of n - 1 securities (i.e. excluding security i). The values of R1 for the three samples XRisk, XComp, and XAll are 10.0655, 0.0219, and 0.2899, respectively. From these results we take that the PCA has some stability issues
when only considering risk factors. Otherwise results are stable.

11

3 Adjusted Weighting of Factor Scores
In the following we consider two different applications of adjusting the weights applied to X. First, we try to find a weighting vector w  Rk such that the projection xi w for each security i is as close as possible to its known expert score. Second, we evaluate the maximum distance between the projections of X through randomly chosen random vectors w.

3.1 Match Expert Score
Given a matrix X1  {1, 2, 3}n×k, X2  {1, 3, 5}n×k, or X3  {1, 4, 9}n×k and again considering the sub-samples XRisk, XComp, or XAll, we can compute a function

R2(X, w) = X w - f,

(2)

where w is an k × 1 vector of weights and f is an n × 1 vector of expert scores. From this we derive two optimisation problems (OPs) OP1 and OP2,

wOP1

=

arg min
wOP1

X wOP1 - f 1,

and

(3)

wOP2

=

arg min
wOP2

X wOP2 - f 22,

(4)

respectively. Table 2 shows the optimal weights for both OPs using one of X1, X2, or X3 and either risk factors, complexity factors, or both risk and complexity factors. Figures 11 through 16 show the
resulting weighted scores Xw plotted against the known expert scores.
As can be seen in our results, the linear approximation of expert scores is hard, even when using all 11 factors. The sum of squared approximation errors, R2, in Table 2 is lowest for X1 and the use of all factors. A discrete scale of {1, 2, 3} thus appears better suited than the alternatives {1, 3, 5} and {1, 4, 9}.

3.2 Cross Validation via Leave-One-Out
As with the PCA, we perform a LOO analysis to see how strongly the optimisation results for (4) depend on individual securities. We only consider OP2 for X1 because the overall results are best in this specification. The results, depicted in Figure 17, are fairly robust against sample modifications. This is particularly true for X1All.

Table 3: Top Ten Mean Maximum Spread Simulation Weights
The mean of the weighting vectors projecting the ten largest spreads from the original score matrix. The mean vectors for XRisk, XComp, and XAll are normalised to unit vectors.

3.3 Widest Projection Spread

Given some random k × 1 weighting vector we can compute the maximum spread between each projection in X w and its nearest neighbour. We define z = X w and then consider the order statistics of the elements zi of z (i.e. i = 1, . . . , n - 1 : z(i)  z(i+1)). The maximum spread between all z(i) and their respective nearest neighbour is then given by

R3(z) = mn-a1x
i

z(i+1) - z(i)

.

(5)

To examine the influence of the weighting vector w on the maximum projection spread we generate 1000 k × 1 uniform random vectors (w  U(-1, 1)k). These vectors are then scaled to unit vectors.
Figure 18 shows the resulting 1000 simulated maximum spreads. The mean maximum spreads for the risk, complexity, and both risk and complexity cases are s¯Risk = 0.6807, s¯Compl = 0.74725, s¯All = 0.6904. A box plot of the results is shown in Figure 19.

4 Conclusion
We can summarise our results in a few key points: 1. The choice of risk factors, as the PCA has revealed, does not seem to proxy for a single latent source of risk. The opposite is true for the choice of complexity factors. 2. Overall there is a clear positive relation between the first PC of the full PCA, involving all factors, and the expert score of a security as shown in Figure 9. 3. Approximation of the total expert scores through linear projection of the score matrix is possible, but not perfect. We obtain best results by using a score scale of {1, 2, 3} and applying the L2 norm during optimisation.

Figure A2: Correlations of the factors with the first two PCs, based on the PCA of only risk, only complexity, and both risk and complexity factors. The risk factors are volatility, liquidity, credit rating, duration / cash flow, leverage, and diversification degree. The complexity factors comprise of the number of structural layers, expansiveness of derivatives, availability & known pricing models, number of return outcome scenarios, and transparency / ease of understanding.
