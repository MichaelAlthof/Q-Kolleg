STOCHASTIC MORTALITY, MACROECONOMIC RISKS, AND LIFE INSURER SOLVENCY
by Katja Hanewald, Thomas Post, and Helmut Gründl1 Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin First Draft: February 13, 2009 This Draft: March 6, 2009
Abstract Motivated by a recent demographic study establishing a link between macroeconomic fluctuations and the mortality index kt in the Lee-Carter model, we assess the impact of macroeconomic fluctuations on the solvency of a life insurance company. Liabilities in our stochastic simulation framework are driven by a GDP-linked variant of the Lee-Carter mortality model. Furthermore, interest rates and stock prices are allowed to react to changes in GDP, which itself is modeled as a stochastic process. Our results show that insolvency probabilities are significantly higher when the reaction of mortality rates to changes in GDP is incorporated.

1. Introduction
Assumptions about future mortality rates are an integral part of the pricing, reserving, and risk management of insurance companies or pension funds offering annuity and life insurance contracts. Systematic deviations of actual mortality rates from these assumptions can pose a serious threat to the financial stability of those businesses and, consequently, to the economic well-being of policyholders. Thus, there has been considerable recent research into developing models that allow for stochastic mortality, i.e., models that allow for systematic deviations from mortality trends.
In another stream of demographic research, several epidemiological studies find that mortality rates react to changes in macroeconomic conditions. By combining results from both fields of study, Hanewald (2009) shows that the mortality index kt in the well-known Lee-Carter model is significantly correlated with macroeconomic changes. This insight is the inspiration for the present study, which assesses the overall impact of macroeconomic fluctuations on the financial stability of a life insurance company. We develop a dynamic asset-liability model in which both sides of the balance sheet are allowed to react to the state of the economy. Simulation results show that insolvency probabilities are considerably higher when the reaction of mortality rates to changes in the economic indicators is incorporated compared to scenarios where this relationship is ignored. This finding is robust to variations in the age of the insureds, the insurance portfolio size, the equity base, and the share of assets invested in stocks.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains a review of relevant literature. This is followed, in Section 3, by setting up the simulation model for the insurance company. Results of different simulation scenarios are presented in Section 4. A summary and conclusions are provided in Section 5.

2. Literature review 2.1 Stochastic mortality modeling
The development and status quo of stochastic mortality modeling is summarized in Cairns, Blake, and Dowd (2008), Booth (2006), and Booth and Tickle (2008). "The earliest model and still the most popular" (Cairns et al., 2008) was proposed by Lee and Carter (1992). This model is widely employed both in the academic literature and by practitioners working for pension funds, life insurance companies, and public pension systems. The original approach has seen several extensions (see, e.g., Lee and Miller, 2001; Brouhns, Denuit, and Vermunt, 2002; Renshaw and Haberman, 2006), and has been applied to mortality data of many countries, including the G7 countries (Tuljapurkar, Li, and Boe, 2000), Spain (Debón, Montes, and Puig, 2008), Australia (Booth, Maindonald, and Smith, 2002), and China and South Korea (Li, Lee, and Tuljapurkar, 2004). Variations of the Lee-Carter model have been employed to forecast other demographic variables, such as fertility rates or migration flows (Girosi and King, 2008; Härdle and Mysicková, 2009). For mortality modeling, however, the Lee-Miller variant is generally viewed as the standard (Booth and Tickle, 2008). It performs well in a 10-population comparison study of five variants or extensions of the Lee-Carter method (Booth et al., 2006).
2.2 The impact of macroeconomic changes on mortality
The key driver of mortality dynamics in the Lee-Carter model is the "index of the level of mortality" kt (Lee and Carter, 1992). This variable is typically characterized as the "dominant temporal pattern in the decline of mortality" (Tuljapurkar et al., 2000), "a random period effect" (Cairns et al., 2008), or simply as a latent variable (Hári et al., 2008a). However, a recent cross-country study by Hanewald (2009) reveals that the mortality index in the Lee-Carter model is not merely an unobserved, latent variable that fluctuates erratically, but is driven to a considerable extent by external factors. The study shows that changes in kt are significantly correlated with real GDP (gross domestic product) growth rates in Australia, Canada, and the United States, and with
3

unemployment rate changes in Japan, over the period 1950­2005. These findings are in line with previous studies that relate age- and cause-specific mortality rates directly to macroeconomic conditions. Ruhm (2000) was the first to discover that mortality rates fluctuate pro-cyclically in the United States over the period 1972­1991. A similar pattern was observed for mortality rates in the United States, Spain, and Japan (Tapia Granados, 2005a, 2005b, 2008), for Sweden (Tapia Granados and Ionides, 2008), and for 23 OECD countries over the 1960­1997 period (Gerdtham and Ruhm, 2006). Neumayer (2004) and Hanewald (2008) also corroborate Ruhm's results using German data for 1980­2000 and 1956­2004, respectively. Further evidence for France, Japan, and the United States is provided by Reichmuth and Sarferaz (2008).
2.3 Accounting for stochastic mortality in life insurance companies
The financial impact of stochastic mortality (i.e., systematic mortality risk) on a life insurer or pension fund is analyzed in several models. Gründl, Post, and Schulze (2006) and Cox and Lin (2007) examine natural hedging opportunities in the annuity and life insurance business; Dowd, Cairns, and Blake (2006), Hári et al. (2008b), and Bauer and Weber (2008) assess the impact of stochastic mortality on an insurer's risk exposure. None of the studies, however, accounts for the systematic dependency of mortality rates on the economic environment as proxied by real GDP, which is the focus of this contribution.
3. The simulation framework 3.1 The formal model for the insurance business
Our aim is to assess the overall impact of macroeconomic fluctuations on a life insurer's solvency. We set up a dynamic asset-liability model of a life insurance company as described below.
4

Consider a newly founded life insurance company. At the beginning of its first year, in t = 0, it writes I0 homogeneous term-life contracts2 with annually constant premium P per contract. All insureds are assumed to be of age x. The contract duration is for T years and the death benefit is B. For each contract, the premium P is collected immediately. Shareholders contribute a fixed proportion  of the premium income I0 · P as equity capital E0. The sum of premiums and equity comprise the insurer's assets A0.
We assess the insurer's financial stability by its insolvency probability. Insolvency occurs when the firm's equity--measured at market value--is negative at the end of the year. Insolvent insurance firms are not allowed to continue operating. Therefore, the target variable of our analysis is the multi-period insolvency probability t of the insurance firm, which is defined as follows:

t = Pr[Et < 0  t-1 = 1].

(1)

Equity capital at time t is the difference between the market value of assets At and the liabilities Lt at the end of the year:

Et = At ­ Lt.

(2)

Asset values are given by:

At = (At-1 + P · It-1) · Rt ­ B · (­It) ­ Dt,

(3)

where Rt is the stochastic investment return (i.e., exp(rate of return)), B · (­It) are the claims payments,  is the lag operator, and Dt is the annual dividend paid to shareholders.

2 Hanewald (2009) shows that the reaction of mortality rates to real GDP is stronger for the working-age population than for retirees. Therefore, we look at term-life contracts and not, e.g., at annuities.
5

With PVt[·] denoting a present value operator, which is specified in Subsection 3.2, the market value of year-end liabilities Lt is given by:

Lt = PVt[Future claims payment] ­ PVt[Future premium income].

(4)

Dividends Dt at the end of the year are assumed to be a constant fraction d of the insurer's net income for that year Nt when Nt is positive; zero otherwise. Formally, Dt is given by:

Dt = max{d · Nt, 0}, where net income Nt is defined as:

(5)

Nt = At-1 · (Rt ­ 1) + P · It-1 · Rt ­ B · (­It) ­ Lt.

(6)

3.2 Random variables and stochastic processes

We now define the stochastic processes driving our model. Real GDP is introduced first; it is the fundamental link between the other random variables, i.e., the number of surviving insureds It (driven by the mortality index kt) and capital market returns Rt.
Following Kruse, Meitner, and Schröder (2005), a lognormal distribution is assumed for real GDP. Thus annual changes in log real GDP are given by:

ln(real GDPt) = µGDP + GDP · GDP, t ,

(7)

where µGDP and GDP denote the mean and standard deviation of real GDP growth rates and GDP, t is a standardized normal random variable.

The number of deaths at the end of each year ­It is assumed to follow a binomial distribution B(It-1, qx+t-1, t). We hereby account for unsystematic mortality risk, i.e., the

6

fact that the actual number of deaths might deviate from the expected number. The probability for each insured aged x + t - 1 at the beginning of a year to die at the end of the year t is denoted as qx+t-1, t. Considering stochastic mortality, i.e., accounting for systematic mortality risk, the probability qx+t-1, t itself is also a random variable realizing in t. Age-specific mortality probabilities qx, t are derived from the central death rates mx, t of a Lee-Carter-type model, using the approximation:3

qx, t = mx, t / (1 + 0.5 · mx, t).

(8)

According to the Lee-Carter approach, and abstracting from age-specific shocks,4 central death rates mx,t are given by:

mx, t = exp(ax + bx · kt),

(9)

where ax is an age-specific constant and bx describes the sensitivity of age-specific mortality rates to changes in the mortality index kt, which is a random variable.

As in the original Lee and Carter (1992) model, the stochastic process for the mortality index k t is modeled as a random walk with drift:

kt =  + k · k, t,

(10)

with k, t being a standardized normal random variable.

In summary, there are two sources of randomness in our model for the number of deaths. One is based in the uncertainty regarding the path of the underlying mortality index kt. The other source of randomness results from sampling the insurance portfolio.

3 See Cairns, Blake, and Dowd (2008). 4 It is common in the literature to ignore the age-specific error term x, t at this stage of the model (see, e.g., Cairns, Blake, and Dowd, 2008). A justification is provided by Lee and Carter (1992) themselves, who show that up to 90 percent of the standard errors of age-specific death rate forecasts are accounted for by uncertainty in kt (Lee and Carter, 1992, Table.B2, forecast horizon of 10 years).

7

Distribution of the asset return Rt depends on the insurer's asset allocation decisions. Following Kling, Richter, and Ruß (2007), we allow for two lognormally distributed investment opportunities: stocks and bonds. Let rs, t denote the stock log-return in period t and rb, t the bond log-return, and let   [0, 1] be the fraction of assets invested in stocks. Then, the return of the annually rebalanced asset portfolio Rt is given by:

Rt =  · exp(rs, t) + (1 ­ ) exp(rb, t),

(11)

where:

rs, t = µs + s · s, t, and rb, t = µb + b · b, t,

(12)

with µs, µb, s, and b denoting the mean and standard deviation of log-returns, and s, t and b, t being standardized normal random variables.

In a last step, we specify the value of the insurer's liabilities at the end of each year Lt, which were introduced in Equation (4). At the end of every year, the insurer observes the realized bond returns and the current level of the mortality index kt. The insurer uses the latter as a starting point for projecting future mortality rates; observed bond returns are used to discount expected liabilities. Thus, the market value of liabilities--in the "second" between that year's claim payments and next year's premium income--is given by:

 Lt

(13)

where iqx,t is the probability that an insured aged x will die after age x + i - 1, while ipx,t is the probability that an insured aged x will survive at least another i years. The insurer calculates both probabilities conditional on the information available at time t. In

8

Equation (13), the present value calculus is specified by taking the expectation of future cash flows with respect to the real-world probability measure without further risk adjustments. Thus, we assume that the insurer is unaware of any correlations between mortality and GDP or the capital market development, i.e., the insurer does not consider the systematic nature of mortality risk.
In summary, economic and demographic randomness in our model are induced by the following random variables: the mortality index kt, real GDP growth rates, and bond and stock returns. The main contribution of this paper is to account for the interaction of these factors, especially the dependency between mortality rates and economic conditions, which we accomplish by allowing for a correlation matrix with nonzero offdiagonal elements for the random variables k, t, s, t, b, t, and GDP, t.5
3.3 Numerical calibration of the model
Calibration of the model involves estimating parameters of the stochastic processes from empirical data, as well as setting insurance contract and management parameters. We begin with a base scenario, but will vary several of the parameters later on in the analysis.
3.2.1 Management assumptions
The fixed proportion  of the first premium income I0 · P raised as initial equity capital E0 is set to 0.1. The dividend ratio d, i.e., the constant fraction of the insurer's net income paid out to shareholders, is set to 0.1. The asset fraction  that is invested in stocks is set to 0.3. This parameter set results in reasonably small one-period insolvency probabilities.
5 Demographic studies show that the impact of changes in the macroeconomic conditions on mortality rates is primarily contemporary (see, e.g., Tapia Granados, 2005). Our data confirm this finding. Correlation between the mortality index and GDP growth rates of the previous year turned out to be close to zero. Therefore, we only account for correlations at time t in our model.
9

3.2.2 Contract characteristics

We consider a term-life insurance contract with a duration of T = 10 years and a death benefit of B = $100,000. This contract is sold to I0 = 10,000 insureds in t = 0. In the base scenario, all insureds are male and of age x = 40. Mortality data are available up until 2005; therefore, the simulation starts with t = 0 at the beginning of 2006.

The fair premium for an individual contract is calculated by solving Equation (14) for Pfair:

.

(14)

Thus, the same assumptions used to calculate future liabilities in Equation (13) apply for premium calculation. The contract is sold at a premium P that includes a proportional loading  on the fair premium, which, in the base scenario, is set to 0.1:

P = (1 + ) · Pfair. 3.2.3 Stochastic processes

(15)

Death rates and population size for the United States were obtained from the Human Mortality Database (University of California and Max Planck Institute, 2008), where they are available up until 2005. A series for "GDP in billions of chained 2000 dollars" was obtained from the website of the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (Bureau of Economic Analysis, 2008). For calibration of the return processes we use annual total returns of large company stocks and U.S. treasury bills, which are published in Morningstar (2008). In the following, these series are referred to as real GDP, stock returns, and bond returns.

The Lee-Carter model was estimated with the R package "demography" by Hyndman et al. (2008). The Lee-Miller (2001) variant was chosen; it has been widely adopted as the standard Lee-Carter method (Booth and Tickle, 2008) and involves estimating the model for the latter half of the twentieth century6. Male and female forecasts are treated as two separate applications of the basic Lee-Carter approach (Lee, 2000). The model is estimated with the same upper age limit as in the original (85 years) article by Lee and Carter (1992) and a minimum age of 30. Fig. 1 plots the estimated parameters ax and bx that are needed to derive age-specific death rates mx,t from the mortality index kt.. Fig. 2 plots the mortality index kt that was extracted for U.S. males for 1950­2005, together with the 2006­2015 forecast.

The extracted time series for the mortality index kt, together with the time series for GDP and returns, are used to estimate the parameters and correlation structure of the four exogenous stochastic processes. Based on results from Hanewald (2009), the period 1989­2005 was chosen for estimation. Hanewald's study documents a structural change in the correlation structure between real GDP growth rates and the mortality index in six OECD countries over the period 1950­2005. For the United States, a significant break point was identified for 1989 using dummy variable regressions.

6 Furthermore, the approach involves adjustment of the mortality index kt to life expectancy e0 instead of total deaths, and forecasting forward from observed (rather than fitted) rates.

4. Simulation results

The insurance company model was simulated with 100,000 iterations using the Latin Hypercube technique (McKay, Conover, and Beckman, 1979).

As a benchmark for comparison, we first simulate a version of the model that ignores the impact of macroeconomic changes on mortality rates. This scenario assumes that the mortality index kt in the Lee-Carter model is uncorrelated with economic conditions as reflected by the processes for GDP, stocks, and bonds, i.e., entries in the last column of the correlation matrix in Table 1 are set to 0 (except the last value, which is 1). Next, the scenario employing the full correlation structure is simulated. The difference in insolvency probabilities between the two scenarios is a measure of model misspecification risk. Results are given in Fig. 3.

Fig. 3 Multi-period insolvency probability t, base parameter calibration, full correlation structure vs. reduced correlation structure.
Multi-period insolvency probabilities increase over time in both scenarios. There are two reasons for this: first, confidence intervals for the realizations of the random variables, e.g., for the mortality index kt (c.p., Fig. 2), broaden with an increasing time horizon; and second, insolvency probabilities cumulate because firms that become insolvent remain insolvent.
Looking at Fig. 3 reveals that employing the full correlation structure increases the insolvency probability for every time horizon considered. Thus, ignoring the correlations between the mortality index kt and the economic variables will result in a systematic underestimation of the true insolvency probability. This will occur because the true correlation structure links assets and liabilities in a very unfavorable way: a drop in GDP, in tendency, coincides with lower stock and bond returns, i.e., with a shrinking asset base, along with a higher mortality index kt, resulting in higher liabilities. Both effects take a toll on equity capital. In absolute numbers, the difference in insolvency probabilities between the two scenarios increases from 0.1 percentage points in t = 1 to 1.8 percentage points in t = 10.

Fig. 4 Multi-period insolvency probabilities t, reduced and full correlations structure, different initial ages x.

For all four ages, we again observe higher insolvency probabilities under the full correlation structure, meaning that our results are robust to changes in age. However, there are two noteworthy effects that result from varying the age parameter. First, insolvency probabilities decrease in initial age. This is due to the fact, that for higher ages generally the variation of the number of deaths around the (now higher) mean in relative terms, i.e., the variation coefficient, is smaller. Second, the increase in insolvency probabilities from switching to the full correlation scenario is greater at higher ages x, except for age x = 60. This effect is explained by the different sensitivity

14

of the age-specific death rates to shocks in the mortality index kt, which is controlled by bx (c.p., Equation (9)). As can be seen in Fig. 1, the parameter bx exhibits a humpshaped profile, peaking around age 50. For that reason, we observe a smaller absolute increase in insolvency probability for age x = 60 in comparison to age x = 50.

The effect of different initial insurance portfolio sizes I0 is illustrated in Fig. 5.

Not surprisingly, we find that insolvency probabilities are generally higher for smaller portfolios due to a less pronounced risk pooling. However, in relative terms, ignoring the true correlation structure leads to a more severe underestimation of the true insolvency probability for larger portfolios. For example, the relative change in the level of the 10-year insolvency probability amounts to +10.5% for I0 = 5,000 insureds versus +53.1% for I0 = 20,000 insureds. This effect can be explained by noting that in small portfolios less unsystematic risk is eliminated compared to large portfolios. By accounting for the full correlation structure, a similar amount of systematic risk (in absolute terms) is added to the risk exposure of both small and large portfolios, leading to a higher relative increase in the overall risk, measured by the insolvency probability, for large portfolios. In other words, for both small and large portfolios the

15

diversification potential decreases, but with more severe consequences for a portfolio originally believed to be well-diversified.

Insolvency probabilities in Fig. 6 are similar, and for similar reasons, to those shown in Fig. 5. A higher equity buffer, i.e., a higher constant fraction  of initial premium income raised as equity capital, improves the insurer's solvency situation. Adding, through implementing the full correlation structure, a similar absolute amount of systematic risk on top of the three considered risk exposures leads to a larger relative increase in risk for higher initial amounts of equity capital. In this sense, safer firms, meaning those with greater equity capital, suffer more from the described model risk.

Fig. 7 Multi-period insolvency probabilities t, reduced and full correlations structure, different proportions  of assets invested in stocks.

First, Fig. 7 again confirms that insolvency probabilities are always higher under the full correlation structure.

Second, we observe some general effects of increasing the proportion of stocks in the asset portfolio. On the one hand, the higher expected return of stocks can lead to reduced insolvency probabilities as assets accumulate more rapidly (compare  = 0 with  = 0.1, and  = 0.3 with  = 0.5). On the other hand, the higher volatility of stocks can worsen the insurer's solvency situation (compare  = 0.1 with  = 0.3).

17

Third, the proportion of stocks influences the difference in insolvency probabilities between the two scenarios both in absolute and in relative terms. A larger fraction of stocks induces a higher exposure of the insurer to the unfavorable dependency between GDP, assets, and mortality, thus liabilities, that was described under Fig. 1. Hence, ignoring the full correlation structure results in a more severe underestimation of insolvency probability by insurers heavily invested in stocks.
5. Conclusion and outlook
Based on demographic findings establishing a link between macroeconomic conditions and mortality, we assess the impact of macroeconomic fluctuations on the financial stability of a life insurance company. We develop a dynamic asset-liability model that allows both sides of the balance sheet to react to the state of the economy. Stochastic drivers in our model are real GDP, mortality, bond returns, and stock returns.
We find that multi-period insolvency probabilities are considerably higher when taking into account the dependencies between the mortality index kt in the Lee-Carter model and economic conditions. Thus, ignoring the existing dependency structure will lead an insurer to systematically underestimate its true insolvency probability. This result is robust to variations in the age of insureds, portfolio size, equity base, and asset allocation. Through the systematic nature of mortality risk, the relative increase in insolvency probability is higher for insurers with a generally lower insolvency probability. In our model, these are the insurers that have a high equity buffer, relatively mature insureds, and have written a large number of contracts. Additionally, the underestimation risk is more severe for insurers heavily invested in stocks, both in absolute and relative terms.
Therefore, the interaction between mortality and macroeconomic conditions needs to be an integral part of life insurers' internal risk models, of capital allocation decision making, and of solvency assessment by rating agencies and regulatory authorities.

Taking this crucial relationship into consideration will make assessments of an insurer's risk situation more accurate and thus more effectively protect policyholders.
Other useful applications of our model could involve investigating a more general insurance portfolio that includes a mixed age structure or annuity contracts. For a mixed age structure, we expect the following: Because all age-specific mortality rates react in the same direction to changes in GDP, the resulting effect on insolvency probabilities would be a mixture of the age-specific increases shown in Fig. 4. Including annuities, i.e., contracts written on the opposite site of mortality risk, would give rise to natural hedging opportunities, as analyzed in Gründl, Post, and Schulze (2006) and Cox and Lin (2007). Additionally, dependencies between lapse and surrender rates and macroeconomic conditions (Browne, Carson and Hoyt, 2001; Kim, 2005) could be accounted for.
