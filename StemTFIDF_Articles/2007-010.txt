Abstract Recently, Frittelli and Scandolo ([9]) extend the notion of risk measures, originally introduced by Artzner, Delbaen, Eber and Heath ([1]), to the risk assessment of abstract financial positions, including pay offs spread over different dates, where liquid derivatives are admitted to serve as financial instruments. The paper deals with -additive robust representations of convex risk measures in the extended sense, dropping the assumption of an existing market model, and allowing also unbounded financial positions. The results may be applied for the case that a market model is available, and they encompass as well as improve criteria obtained for robust representations of the original convex risk measures for bounded positions ([4], [7], [16]).

0 Introduction
The notion of risk measures has been introduced by Artzner, Delbaen, Eber and Heath (cf. [1]) as the key concept to found an axiomatic approach for risk assessment of fincancial positions. Technically, risk measures are functionals defined on sets of financial positions, satisfying some basic properties to qualify riskiness consistently. An outcome of such a functional, that means the risk of a position, is usually interpreted as the capital requirement of the position to become an acceptable one. Genuinely, risk measures has been defined for one-period positions. Recently Fritelli and Scandolo ([9]) provide a general framework which extends considerations to abstract financial positions including pay off streams with liquid derivatives as hedging positions. Applied to the risk assessment of pay off streams such general risk measures are used for an a priori qualification, which means to take the static perspective. In contrary the dynamic risk assessment take into account adjustments time after time. Readers who interested in this topic are referred to e.g. [8], [18], [21]. The main goal of this paper is to investigate risk measures  which admit a robust representation of the form
(X) = sup(-(X) - ()),

where X denotes a financial position,  a linear form on the set of financial positions, and  stands for a penalty function on the set of linear forms. Special attention will be paid to the problem when these representing linear forms may in turn be represented by (-additive) probability measures. We shall speak of a robust representation of  by probability measures or a -additive robust representation. Necessarily, only so-called convex risk measures, that means risk measures which are convex mappings, may have such a robust representation. The basic assumption of this paper is that the investors are uncertain about the market model underlying the outcomes of the financial positions. Within this setting a robust representation by probability measures offers an additional economic interpretation of the risk measures. As suggested by Fo¨llmer and Schied (cf. [7]) such a representation means that an investor has a set of possible models for the outcomes of the financial positions in mind, and evaluates the worst expected losses together with some penalty costs for misspecification w.r.t. these models. The problem of -additive robust representations of convex risk measures in the genuine sense has been completely solved in the case that the investors have market models at hand. Ruszczynski and Shapiro showed that convex risk measures always admit robust representations by probability measures if for any real p > 1 every integrable mapping of order p is available (cf. [19]). However the used methods can not be applied to essentially bounded positions. Drawing on methods from functional analysis, Delbaen as well as F¨ollmer and Schied succeeded in giving a full characterization (cf. [4], [7]) by the so-called Fatou property. As pointed out by Delbaen, the Fatou property fails to be sufficient in general when the investor is faced with model uncertainty. Moreover, the problem of -additive robust representation is still open when a market model is not available. Restricting considerations on bounded one-period positions, F¨ollmer and Schied (in [7]) suggested a strict sufficient criterion, Kr¨atschmer
2

showed that it is in some sense also necessary, and he adds some more general conditions ([16]). This paper may be viewed as a continuation of the studies in [7] as well as in [16]. The generalizations will be proceeded in several directions. First of all multiperiod positions and liquid hedging instruments will be allowed. Secondly we shall drop the assumptions that only bounded positions are traded. This is in accordance with empirical evidences that the distributions of risky assets often show heavy tails. Thirdly we want to investigate the issue of strong robust representations by probability measures in the sense that the optimization involved in the -additive robust representation has a solution. This is a quite important technical issue from the practical point of view. In many cases the calculation of outcomes of risk measures has to be employed by numerical optimization algorithms, and the most customary ones assume the existence of solutions. In presence of a market model, Jouini, Schachermayer and Touzi (cf. [11]) have given a full solution to the problem of strong robust representations. Finally, the criteria should encompass the results already derived within a fixed market model. The paper is organized as follows. Section 1 introduces the concept of Frittelli and Scandolo to define risk measures in general, and some representation results of risk measures will be presented as starting points for the investigations afterwards. The following section 2 deals with the question when the Fatou property might be used as a sufficient condition. In general, as a rule a nonsequential counterpart is more suitable unless in some special cases. However, it also seems that even the nonsequential Fatou property is appropriate in quite exceptional situations only. Therefore an alternative general criterion is offered in section 3, extending a former result in [16] to unbounded positions, within a nontopological framework. It will be used for strong robust representations of risk measures by probability measures in section 4. We shall succeed in giving a complete solution. In particular the aboved mentioned strict criterion by Fo¨llmer and Schied will turn out to be necessary and sufficient. The investigations of the sections 1 - 4 will then be applied to recover in section 5 the already known representation results within a given market model. The proofs of the main results will be provided separately in the sections 7, 8 and 9 as well as in appendix B. They rely on some technical arguments gathered in section 6 and a measure theoretical tool presented in appendix A.
1 Some basic representations of convex risk measures
Let us fix a set . Financial positions will be expressed by mappings X  R. As a special case  = e × T with e denoting a set of scenarios, equipped with a family (Ft)tT of -algebras, and T being a time set, we may consider financial positions X  R×T with X(·, t) being Ft-measurable for every t  T. They may be viewed as discounted pay off streams, liquidated at the dates from the time set. The available financial positions are gathered by a nonvoid vector subspace X  R containing the constants. Sometimes we shall in addition assume that X  Y := min{X, Y }, X  Y := max{X, Y }  X for X, Y  X. In this case X is a so-called Stonean vector
3

lattice. For the space of bounded positions from X the symbol Xb will be used. Furthermore let us fix a vector subspace C  X of financial positions for hedging, including the constants. In particular we may take into account

liquid derivatives like put and call options as financial instruments. They are associated with a positive linear

function  : C  R, (1) = 1, where (Y ) stands for the initial costs to obtain Y. Prominent special cases of this

setting are the following:

· T = {1, ..., n}, (Ft)tT family of -algebras on a set of scenarios e, X consisting of all X  R×T with

n

X(·, t) Ft - measurable for

t  T,

C = Rn,

(y1, ..., yn) :=

1 n

P yi

i=1

n-period positions, one-period positions if n = 1

· T = [0, T ], (Ft)tT be a filtration of -algebras on a set of scenarios e, X set of financial positions X with X(, ·) being a cadlag function, C = R,  identity on R

cadlag positions
Let us now introduce the concept of risk measures suggested by Frittelli and Scandolo in [9]. As for one-period positions we may choose the axiomatic viewpoint, defining a risk measure w.r.t.  to be a functional  : X  R which satisfies the properties
· monotonicity: (X)  (Y ) for X  Y · translation invariance w.r.t. : (X + Y ) = (X) - (Y ) for X  X, Y  C The meaning of these conditions may be transferred from the genuine concept of risk measures. Moreover, it can be shown that a risk measure  w.r.t.  satisfies (X) = inf{(Y ) | Y  C, (X + Y )  0} for any X  X ([9], Proposition 3.6). Regarding -1(] - , 0]) as the acceptable positions, an outcome (X) expresses the infimal costs to hedge it. This retains the original meaning of risk measures as capital requirements. In the following we shall focus on so-called convex risk measures, defined to mean risk measures which are convex mappings. Convexity is a reasonable condition for a risk measure due to its interpretation that diversification should not increase risk. From the technical point of view convexity is a necessary property for the desired dual representations of risk measures. Let us now fix a convex risk measure  : X  R w.r.t. . It is associated with the so-called Fenchel-Legendre transform
 : X ] - , ],   sup (-(X) - (X)),
XX
where X gathers all real linear forms on X. It is easy to verify that every  from the domain of  has to be a positive linear form extending . The standard tools from convex analysis provide basic representation results for  with  as a penalty function.
Proposition 1.1 Let X+ denote the space of all positive linear forms on X which extend , and let  be any topology on X such that (X,  ) is a locally convex topological vector space with topological dual X . Then (X) =

The proof may be found in Appendix B. The aim of the paper is to improve the representation results by allowing only representing linear forms which are in turn representable by probability measures. For notational purposes let us introduce the counterpart of  w.r.t. the probability measures on the -algebra (X) on  generated by X

 : M1 ] - , ], P  sup (-EP[X] - (X)). XX
Here M1 is defined to consist of all probability measures P on (X) such that all positions from X are P -integrable,
and EP[X] denotes the expected value of X w.r.t. P . We shall speak of a robust representation by probability
measures from M or a -additive robust representation of  w.r.t. M if M  M1 nonvoid, and
(X) = sup (-EP[X] - (P)) for every X  X. As an immediate consequence of Proposition 1.1 we obtain a first
PM
characterization of such representations.

Proposition 1.2 Let F be a vector space of bounded countably additive set functions on (X) which separates points in X such that each X  X is integrable w.r.t. any µ  F. Then in the case that the set M1(F ) of all P  M1  F with EP|C =  is nonvoid
(X) = sup (-EP[X] - (P)) for all X  X
PM1(F )
if and only if  is lower semicontinuous w.r.t. weak topology (X, F ) on X induced by F.

Remark 1.3 Retaking assumptions and notations from Proposition 1.2,  admits a robust representation in terms
of M1(F ) if F contains the Dirac measures, and if lim inf (Xi)  (X) holds for every net (Xi)iI in X which i
converges pointwise to some X  X.

In general the lower semicontinuity of  w.r.t. the topology from Proposition 1.2 is not easy to verify. Therefore we are looking for more accessible conditions. The considerations will be based on the idea to reduce the investigations to bounded financial positions. As shown in Lemma 6.5 below, in case of X being a Stonean vector lattice, this may be achieved if the linear forms from the domain of  are representable by finitely additive set functions in the sense explained there. Fortunately, we might express this condition equivalently by the property that lim (-(X - n)+) = (0) ((X - n)+ positive part of X - n) is satisfied for every  > 0 and any nonnegative
n
X  X, which is obviously true if all positions in X are bounded (cf. Proposition 6.6 below). Before going into the development of criteria for -additive representations let us collect some necessary conditions. In the case that the positions from X are essentially bounded mappings w.r.t. a reference probability measure of

5

a given market model the so-called Fatou property plays a prominent role. Adapting this concept, we shall say

that a risk measure  fulfill the Fatou property if lim inf (Xn)  (X) whenever (Xn)n denotes a uniformly n
bounded sequence in X which converges pointwise to some bounded X  X. The Fatou property implies obviously

that |Xb is continuous from above, defined to mean (Xn)

Proposition 1.4 Let  admit a -additive robust representation w.r.t. some nonvoid M  M1, then  satisfies
the Fatou property and |Xb is continuous from above. Moreover, if X is a Stonean vector lattice, and if L  X
denotes any Stonean vector lattice which contains C as well as generates (X), then (X) = sup inf (Z)

for every bounded nonegative X  X, where E := {sup Yn | Yn  L, Yn  0, sup Yn bounded}.

The proof may be found in section 7. As mentioned in the introduction, a robust representation of  by probability measures is not guaranteed in general by the Fatou property or continuity from above, even if X contains bounded positions only. In the next section we shall investigate additional conditions to guarantee the sufficiency by the Fatou property and a nonsequential counterpart.

2 Representation of convex risk measures by probability mea-
sures and the Fatou properties
It will turn out by the investigations within this section that in the case of uncertainty about the market model the nonsequential counterpart of the Fatou property takes over partly the role that the Fatou property plays when a reference probability measure is given. We shall say that  satisfies the nonsequential Fatou property if lim inf (Xi)  (X) holds whenever (Xi)iI is a uniformly bounded net in X which converges pointwise to some
i
bounded X  X. The following condition provides an important special situation when the Fatou property and its nonsequential counterpart are equivalent.
(2.1) For any r > 0, every Z  Xb from the closure of Ar := {X  Xb | (X)  0, sup |X()|  r} w.r.t. the

topology of pointwise convergence on Xb is the pointwise limit of a sequence in Ar.
Lemma 2.1 Under (2.1)  satisfies the nonsequential Fatou property if and only if it fulfills the Fatou property.
The proof is delegated to section 9. Remark:

6

The sequential condition (2.1) is closely related with the concepts of double limit relations. For a comprehensive exposition the reader is referred to [15]. In general one may try to apply double limit relations to the sets Ar from (2.1) and suitable sets of bounded countably additive set functions on (X).

The main result of this section relies on the following assumption, denoting by B() the space of all bounded
real-valued mappings on .
(2.2) The sets Br := {X  Xb | sup |X()|  r} (r > 0) are closed w.r.t. the topology of pointwise convergence

on B().

Theorem 2.2 Let either X = Xb or X be a Stonean vector lattice such that lim (-(X - n)+) = (0) holds for n
any nonnegative X  X,  > 0. Furthermore let F denote a vector space of bounded countably additive set functions

on (X) which contains all Dirac measures as well as at least one probability measure P with EP|C =  such that

every X  X is integrable w.r.t. any µ  F. Additionally, F is supposed to be complete w.r.t. the seminorm
defined by µ F := sup{| R X dµ| | X  Xb, sup |X()|  1}. Consider the following statements:

.1  satisfies the nonsequential Fatou property.

· F,

.2  has a -additive robust representation w.r.t. M1  F.

.3  fulfills the Fatou property.

If (2.2) is valid, then .1  .2  .3, and all statements are equivalent provided that condition (2.1) holds in addition. In the case that the sets Ar from (2.1) are even relatively compact w.r.t. the weak topology (X, F ) we have .1  .2  .3.

The proof will be performed in section 9.
Remark 2.3 The nonsequential Fatou property is not necessary for a -additive representation of risk measures. Take for example X the space of all boundend Borel-measurable mappings on R, and define  by (X) = -EP[X], where P denotes any probability measure which is absolutely convex w.r.t. the Lebesgue-Borel measure on R. Obviously, on one hand  is a convex risk measure w.r.t. the identity on R, having a trivial -additive robust representation. On the other hand, consider the set I of the cofinite subsets of R, directed by set inclusion, and the net (Xi)iI of all its indicator mappings. It converges pointwise to 0, but unfortunately lim inf (Xi) = -1 < 0 =
i
(0).

Remark 2.4 Let F be any vector space of bounded countably additive set functions on (X) such that each X  X is integrable w.r.t. every µ  F, and such that Xb separates points in F. Additionally, F is supposed to be closed w.r.t. the norm of total variation. Then the sets Ar from (2.1) are relatively (X, F )-compact if and only if Xb may be identified via evaluation mapping with the topological dual of F w.r.t. the norm of total variation (cf. proof in section 9).

7

In the case of an at most countable , we have a simplified situation which admits an application of the full Theorem 2.2. The reason is that then the topology of pointwise convergence on the space B() is metrizable.
Corollary 2.5 Let  be at most countable, and let X  B() be sequentially closed w.r.t. the pointwise topology on B(). Then  has a robust representation by probability measures from M1 if and only it satisfies the Fatou property, or equivalently, if and only if  is continuous from above.
As another application of Theorem 2.2 we shall retain in the proof of Theorem 5.3 below the above mentioned result that in face of a market model the Fatou propery describes equivalently robust representations of convex risk measures for essentially bounded positions by probability measures. Unfortunately, it is unclear whether we may avoid in Theorem 2.2 condition (2.2) in order to guarantee a -additive robust representation of risk measures by the nonsequential Fatou property. Moreover, the nonsequential Fatou property is unsatisfactory in the way that it does not work for trivial representations like those indicated in Remark 2.3. However, we may only provide a sufficient substitution by the Fatou property under the quite restrictive condition (2.1). So it seems that in presence of model uncertainty the Fatou property and its nonsequential counterpart are appropriate conditions for -additive representations of convex risk measures in quite exceptional situations only. Therefore we shall look for alternatives in the following section.
3 Robust representation of convex risk measures by inner regu-
lar probability measures
Throughout this section let X be a Stonean vector lattice, and let L  X denote any Stonean vector lattice

which contains C as well as generates (X) and which induces the set system S := { T Xn-1([xn, [) | Xn 
n=1
L nonnegative, bounded, xn > 0}. Additionally, let E consist of all bounded sup Yn, where (Yn)n is a sequence
n
of nonnegative bounded positions from L. In view of the inner Daniell-Stone theorem (cf. [14], Theorem 5.8, final remark after Addendum 5.9) every probability measure P  M1 has to be inner regular w.r.t. S, i.e. P(A) = sup P(B) for every A  (X). So within this setting we are dealing with robust representations of  by
ABS
probability measures from M1(S) defined to consist of all probability measures belonging to M1 which are inner regular w.r.t. S and which represent  on C. We are ready to formulate the general representation result w.r.t. inner regular probability measures.
Theorem 3.1 Let c (c ] - (0), [) gather all P  M1(S) with (P)  c, and let  satisfy the following properties.
(1) (X) = sup inf (Z) for all nonnegative bounded X  X,
XY E Y ZX

(2) inf (Z) = inf (Z) for Y  E,

Y ZL

(3) (Xn) (X) for any isotone sequence (Xn)n of bounded positions Xn  L with Xn

(4) lim (-(X - n)+) = (0) for every nonnegative X  X and  > 0. n
Then we may state:

X  L, X bounded,

.1 The initial topology L on M1(S) induced by the mappings X : M1(S)  R, P  EP[X], (X  L) is completely regular and Hausdorff.

.2 Each c (c ] - (0), [) is compact w.r.t. L, and furthermore for every  from the domain of  there is some P  M1(S) with |L = EP|L and (P)  ().

.3 (X) = sup (EP[-X] - (P)) for all X  X.
PM1 (S )
The proof of Theorem 3.1 is delegated to section 7.

Remarks 3.2 In view of Proposition 1.4, assumption (1) in Theorem 3.1 is necessary for a robust representation of  by probability measures. Let us now point out some special situations where the assumptions on , imposed in Theorem 3.1, may be simplified:

.1 If X is restricted to bounded positions, then assumption (4) is redundant. Also (1), (2) hold in general in the case X = L.

.2 By Lemma 6.4 below assumption (3) is fulfilled in general whenever L+b, consisting of all nonnegative

bounded X  L, is a so-called Dini cone, i.e. inf sup Xn() = sup inf Xn() for any antitone sequence

n 

 n

(Xn)n in L+b with pointwise limit in L+b. The most prominent Dini cones are the cones of nonnegative

upper semicontinuous and nonnegative continuous real-valued mappings on compact Hausdorff spaces due to

the general Dini lemma (cf. [12], Theorem 3.7).

.3 If E  X, then assumptions (1), (2) read as follows:

(1) (X) = sup (Y ) for all nonnegative bounded X  X,
XY E
(2) (Y ) = inf (Z) for Y  E. Y ZL
We may specialize to X = L, and a direct application of Theorem 3.1 in combination with Lemma 6.4 below
leads to the following condition to ensure that every linear form  from the domain of  is representable by a
probability measure. Note that here M1(S) = M1.

Corollary 3.3 Let X be a Stonean vector lattice, and let lim (-(X -n)+) = (0) be valid for every nonnegative n
X  X,  > 0. Then every linear form from the domain of  is representable by some probability measure from M1
if and only if (Xn) (X) whenever (Xn)n is an isotone sequence of bounded positions from X which converges
pointwise to some bounded X  X.

Remark: Corollary 3.3 extends a respective result for bounded one-period positions ([16], Proposition 3).
Let us now consider some special situations where Theorem 3.1 might be used.

Remark 3.4 Let  = e × T with e denoting a set of scenarios, equipped with a metrizable topology e as well as the induced -algebra B(e), and T being a time set, endowed with a separably metrizable topology T as well as the generated -algebra B(T). Furthermore let X consist of all bounded real-valued mappings on e × T which are measurable w.r.t. the product -algebra B(e)  B(T), and let L be the set of all bounded real-valued mappings on e × T which are continuous w.r.t. the product topology e × T. Finally S is defined to gather the closed subsets of e × T w.r.t. the metrizable topology e × T. Using the introduced notations, (X) = B()  B(T) is generated by S, L  X, and we may restate Theorem 3.1 with E being the space of all bounded nonnegative lower semicontinuous mappings on e × T. This version generalizes an analogous result for the one-period positions (cf. [16], Theorem 2), and will be proved in section 7.

We may also utilize Theorem 3.1 for cadlag positions.

Remark 3.5 Let T = [0, T ], C = R, let (Ft)tT be a filtration of -algebras on some nonvoid set e, and let X be the set of cadlag positions. Then (X) is the so-called optional -algebra. We may associate for stopping

times S1, S2, S1  S2, the stochastic interval [S1, S2[, defined by [S1, S2[(, t) := 1 if S1()  t < S2(), and

[S1, S2[(, t) := 0 otherwise. I stands for the set of all such stochastic intervals. It can be shown that (X) is

generated by the stochastic intervals [S, [ (cf. [5], IV, 64).

For L let us choose the vector space spanned by the stochastic intervals [S, [, which is also spanned by the positions

max [Si, Sei[ (r  N), where [Si, Sei[  I for i  {1, ..., r}. Moreover, L is indeed a Stonean vector lattice, and
i{1,...,r}

{X-1([x, [) | X  L nonnegative, x > 0} is an algebra consisting of all the subsets

r
S

`[Si,

Sei[´-1({1})

with

r



N

i=1

and [Si, Sei[  I for i  {1, ..., r}.

Using the introduced notations, we may restate Theorem 3.1.

Theorem 3.1 may be used as a basis to derive conditions for a strong robust representation of , i.e. a -additive robust representation where solutions of the associated optimization problems exist. We shall succeed in finding a full characterization in the next section.

4 Strong robust representation of convex risk measures by probability measures

We want to look for conditions which induce a strong robust representation of  by probability measures in the sense that
(X) = max (-EP[X] - (P)) PM1
holds for any X  X. The considerations are reduced to a Stonean vector lattice X being stable w.r.t. countable convex combinations of antitone sequences of financial positions. In this case the following result gives a complete answer to the problem of strong robust representations.

Theorem 4.1 Let X be a Stonean vector lattice and let us assume that for every antitone sequence (Xn)n in



X with Xn 0 and each sequence (n)n in [0, 1] with P n = 1 there is some pointwise limit P nXn of

n=1

n=1

m

( P nXn)m belonging to X. Then the following statements are equivalent:

n=1

.1 (X) = max (-EP[X] - (P)) holds for every X  X. PM1

.2 (Xn) (X) for Xn X.

.3 lim (-(X - n)+) = (0) hold for arbitrary nonnegative X  X,  > 0, and (Xn) n sequence (Xn)n of bounded positions from X with Xn X, X being bounded.

(X) for any isotone

In any of these cases every linear form from the domain of  is representable by a probability measure. Moreover,
for any Stonean vector lattice L  X which contains C as well as generates the same -algebra as X and induces

the set system S consisting of all sets T Xn-1([xn, [) (Xn  L  Xb nonnegative, xn > 0) any of the statements

.1 - .3 is implied by

n=1

We have even equivalence of the statements .1 - .4 if the indicator mappings 1A (A  S) belong to X.

The proof may be found in section 8. For bounded one-period positions, Theorem 4.1 enables us to give an equivalent characterization of convex risk measures that admit strong robust representations by probability measures.

Corollary 4.2 Let F denote some -algebra on , and let X consist of all bounded F-measurable real-valued mappings. Then the following statements are equivalent:

Let us adapt Theorem 4.1 to the special situations of Remarks 3.4, 3.5.
Corollary 4.3 In the special context of Remark 3.4 with the notations introduced there all the statements .1 - .4 of Theorem 4.1 are equivalent.
Remark: Corollary 4.3 generalizes a result for one-period positions (cf. [16], Theorem 1).
Remark 4.4 Let T = [0, T ], C = R, let (Ft)tT be a filtration of -algebras on a set of scenarios e, and let X be the set of cadlag positions. Then all statements .1 - .4 from Theorem 4.1 are equivalent, choosing L to be the vector space spanned by the stochastic intervals [S, [ (cf. Remark 3.5).
5 Robust representations of convex risk measures in presence of
given market models
Througout this section we assume that we have a market model with a reference probability measure P on a -algebra F on the set of scenarios . In the following we shall retain, and partly generalize, already known results concerning the -additive robust representations of the convex risk measure  within the setting of a market model. The point is that they may be derived from the results presented in the sections 1, 2 and 4. We shall use the following notations. The spaces of P -integrable mappings of order p  [1, [ and P -essentially bounded mappings will be denoted by Lp(, F , P) and L(, F , P) respectively. For p  [1, ] the symbol Lp(, F , P) will be used for the space formed by identifying functions in Lp(, F , P) that agree P -a.s.. The equivalence class of any X  Lp(, F , P) will be indicated by < X > . The first result may be found in [19] for  being the identity on R. Using Propostion 1.1, we obtain a slight generalization.
Proposition 5.1 Let X = Lp(, F , P) (p  [1, [) with conjugate space Lq(, F , P). Furthermore let (X) = (Y ) for X = Y P a.s.. If M1(q) denotes the set of all Q  M1 having some P -density from Lq(, F , P), then
(X) = max (-EQ[X] - (Q)) for all X  Lp(, F , P). QM1 (q)
12

Proof: Let Lp(, F , P) be equipped with the order , defined by < X > < Y > if X  Y P -a.s., which induces the operations of minimum and maximum. It is known that (Lp(, F , P), · p, ) ( · p Lp - norm) is a Banach lattice, and therefore all positive linear forms w.r.t. are continuous w.r.t. · p (cf. [10], p. 151/152, Corollary 3). Next notice that () <  implies that (Z) = 0 holds for Z = 0 P -a.s., so that ^ (< X >) := (X) describes a well defined positive linear form on Lp(, F , P) w.r.t. . Then the claimed representation of  follows immediately from Proposition 1.1 and the representation result for norm-continuous linear forms on Lp(, F , P).

In the case of X = L(, F , P) we may generalize the equivalent characterization of strong robust representations for  shown in [11].

Theorem 5.2 Let X = L(, F , P), and (X) = (Y ) for X = Y P a.s.. Then (X) = max (-EQ[X] - QM1
(Q)) for all X  L(, F , P) if and only if (Xn) (X) for Xn X P -a.s..

Proof: The statement follows immediately from Theorem 4.1 since the condition (Xn) equivalent with the property (Xn) (X) for Xn X.

(X) for Xn

X P -a.s. is

The next result retains an equivalent characterization of the robust representations for  which may be found in [7] (Theorem 4.31).
Theorem 5.3 Let X := L(, F , P) and  be the identity on C = R. Furthermore  is supposed to satisfy (X) = (Y ) for X = Y P -a.s.. If M1(P) denotes the set of probability measures on F which are absolutely continuous w.r.t. P, then the following statements are equivalent.
.1 (X) = sup (-EQ[X] - (Q)) for all X  L(, F , P).
QM1 (P)
.2 (Xn) (X) for Xn X P -a.s..
.3 lim inf (Xn)  (X) whenever (Xn)n is a uniformly P -essentially bounded sequence in L(, F , P) with n Xn  X P -a.s..
Proof: First of all, b : L(, F , P)  R, b(< X >) := (X) is well defined. Next let SL1+ := {< g > L1(, F , P) | g  0 P -a.s., EP[g] = 1} be endowed with the relative topology of the L1-norm topology on L1(, F , P). We may introduce, via (< X >)(< g >) = EP[Xg], an injective vector space homomorphism  from L(, F , P) onto a vector subspace of Cb(SL1+ ), defined to consist of the bounded,

13

continuous real-valued mappings on SL1+,. The inverse mapping -1 : (L(, F , P))  L(, F , P) may be

used

to

measure

on

:=

(L(, F , P))

w.r.t.

to

the

identity

on

R.

Notice

that (R) consists of all constant real-valued mappings on SL1+ .
Furthermore let F~ be the linear span of the Dirac measures <g> (< g > SL1+ ). For any   F~ there is
some < g > L1(, F , P) such that R (< X >) d = R Xg d P holds for every < X > L(, F , P), and
 F~ := sup{| R (< X >) d| | sup |(< X >)(< g >)|  1} = < g > 1. Here · 1 denotes the L1-norm. <g>SL1+ r
Conversely, for each < g > from L1(, F , P) with arbitrary representation < g >= P i < gi > (r  N, i  R,
i=1 r
< gi > SL1+ ; i = 1, ..., r), we may define  := P i<gi>  F~ which satisfies R (< X >) d = R Xg d P for
i=1
every < X > L(, F , P). Therefore F~ is complete w.r.t. the seminorm · F~ , and in order to apply Theorem
2.2 we have to show that the conditions (2.1), (2.2) are fulfilled for the sets Ar := ~-1(] - , 0])  Br and

Br := {(< X >)  Xe | sup |(< X >)(< g >)|  r} (r > 0).
<g>SL1+
For this purpose fix r > 0. Since L(, F , P) represents the norm dual of L1(, F , P), the application of the
Banach-Alaoglu theorem yields that -1(Br) is (L(, F , P), L1(, F , P))-compact. This in turn implies by
construction that Br is compact w.r.t. the topology (Xe , F~) of pointwise convergence.

Moreover, by definition of , the mapping  : Xe  L1(, F , P), (< X >) < X >, is injective, and continuous w.r.t. (Xe , F~) and the weak topology on L1(, F , P). Since the closure cl(Ar) w.r.t. (Xe , F~) is even compact,

the restriction |cl(Ar) : cl(Ar)  (cl(Ar)) is a homeomorphism w.r.t. the associated relative topologies. In

particular (cl(Ar)) is the weak closure of (Ar), and hence, by Eberlein-Smulian theorem, every element is the

limit point of a sequence in (Ar) w.r.t. the weak topology. Therefore each point from cl(Ar) is the pointwise

limit of a sequence in Ar.

Now in view of Proposition 1.4 the relationships .1  .2  .3 are clear. The implication .3  .1 follows from

Theorem 2.2 by the following argument. Let (Xn)n be a sequence in L(, F , P) and let X  L(, F , P) such

that ((< Xn >)n is uniformly bounded and converges pointwise to (< X >). We may find a subsequence

(Xi(n) )n

with

lim inf (Xn) n

=

lim
n

(Xi(n)

).

Since

the

P -essential

sup

norm

on

L(, F , P)

coincides

with

the operator norm w.r.t. · 1, the sequence (Xn)n is P -essentially bounded. Therefore Komlos' subsequence

theorem (cf. [7], Lemma 1.69) guarantees a sequence (Yn)n of convex combinations Yn from {Xi(m) | m  n}

which converges P -a.s. pointwise to X and satisfies lim inf (Xn)  lim inf (Yn).

6 Some auxiliary results
Throughout this section we want to gather some technical arguments which will be often used when proving the main results of the paper. In the following  denotes a convex risk measure w.r.t.  associated with the
14

Fenchel-Legendre transform  and its counterpart  for the probability measures.

Lemma 6.1 Let X1, X2  X with X1  X2. Then there exists some c ] - (0), [ such that the representation

(Y )

=

max (-(Y
{ c }

)

-

())

holds

for

every

Y

 X with X1  Y

 X2. Moreover, for every Y

 X with

X1  Y  X2 we have ()  c if (Y ) = -(Y ) - ().

Proof: Let Y  X with X1  Y  X. By Proposition 1.1 there is some   -1(R) with (Y ) = -(Y ) - (). Then

() = -(2Y ) - (Y ) + (Y )  (2Y ) + () - (Y ) + (Y ) = (2Y ) - 2(Y )  (2X1) - 2(X2).

Therefore any c > max{(2X1) - 2(X2), -(0)} is as required.

Lemma 6.2 Let X  X with X  inf Z, where E  X is assumed to be downward directed, i.e. for Z1, Z2  E ZE
there is some Z  E with Z  min{Z1, Z2}. Furthermore let   -1(R).

Then inf (Z) = (X) if inf (-(Z - X)) = (0) for arbitrary  > 0.

ZE

ZE

Proof:

For arbitrary  > 0 and every Z  E we have ()  -(-(Z - X)) - (-(Z - X)), and therefore by

assumption

0  inf (Z - X)  () + (0) .

ZE



Finally, by taking   , we obtain inf (Z - X) = 0 because 0  () + (0) < . The proof is now complete. ZE

We may divide the domain of  into the classes {  c} (-(0) = inf  < c < ). The following topological property of these classes is crucial.
Lemma 6.3 {  c} is compact w.r.t. the product topology on RX for every c ] - (0), [.

Proof:

Let c ] - (0), [, and let (i)iI

be

a

net

in

{

which

converges

to

some

w.r.t.

the product

topology. Obviously,  is a positive linear form on X which extends . Furthermore

-(X) - (X) = lim(-i(X) - (X))  lim sup (i)  c for X  X. ii

Therefore {  c} is closed w.r.t. the product topology, and the proof may be completed by the application of

Tychonoff's theorem because {  c} 

[-c - (X), c + (-X)].

X X

15

As an application of Lemma 6.3 we may show the following useful technical argument.

Lemma 6.4 Let E  X consist of nonnegative positions, and let E be upward directed, i.e. for Z1, Z2  E there is

some Z  E with Z  max{Z1, Z2}. Furthermore let X := sup Z  X, and let Y  X be nonnegative and bounded.

ZE

Then

inf

(X

holds

if

inf ((X)
ZE

-

(Z ))

=

for

every





-1(R).

Proof:
Due to Lemma 6.1 there exists some real c > -(0) with (Xe - Y ) = sup (-(Xe - Y ) - ()) for all
{ c }
Xe  E  {X}. Then we may conclude

0  inf (Z - Y ) - (X - Y )  inf sup FZ (),

ZE

ZE {c}

where FZ : {  c}  R,   (X) - (Z), for Z  E.

In the view of Lemma 6.3 ({  c},  ) is a compact Hausdorff space, where  denotes the relative topology

of

the

product

topology

on

X R

to

{



c}.

Since

E

is

upward

directed,

M

:=

{FZ

|

Z



E}

is

a

downward

directed family of real-valued mappings, i.e. for Z1, Z2  E there exists some Z  E with FZ  min{FZ1 , FZ1 }.
Furthermore all functions from M are continuous w.r.t. , and inf FZ () = 0 for   {  c} by assumption. ZE
Therefore the application of the general Dini lemma (cf. [12], Theorem 3.7) leads to inf sup FZ () = 0, ZE {c}
which completes the proof.

In the next step we want to look for conditions which allow to reduce investigations to bounded positions. For this
purpose we have to recall some concepts from integration theory, adapted to our setting. If Q denotes a probability
content on the -algebra (X), i.e. a finitely additive nonnegative set function with Q() = 1, then we shall call a (X)-measurable mapping X with positive and negative part X+ and X- integrable w.r.t. Q if

ZZ Q({X+  x}) dx, Q({X-  x}) dx < .
00
The terminology stems from the fact that Q may be extended via the so-called asymmetric Choquet integral
EQ defined by ([6], Chapter 5, p. 87)

ZZ EQ[X] := Q({X+  x}) dx - Q({X-  x}) dx.
00
It is a positive linear form on the space of all Q -integrable mappings (cf. [6], Proposition 5.1, Theorem 6.3,
Corollary 6.4), and hence the restriction to the bounded ones is even continuous w.r.t. to the sup norm. Therefore
the restriction of EQ to the bounded (X)-measurable mappings is just the respective integral defined in functional analysis (e.g. [7], Appendix A.5). Using the introduced notions, a real linear form  on X is defined to be

16

representable by a probability content if there is some probability content Q such that every X  X is integrable w.r.t. Q and (X) = EQ[X]. If X is a Stonean vector lattice, then X  Y = min{X, Y }, X  Y = max{X, Y }  X for X, Y  X in particular X+ := X  0, X- := (-X)  0  X for any X  X. In this case, if all linear forms from the domain of  are representable by probability contents, then  is concentrated on the bounded positions, and as a consequence  admits a robust representation by probability measures if its restriction to the bounded positions does so.

Lemma 6.5 Let X be a Stonean vector lattice, and let every linear form   -1(R) be representable by some probability content Q on (X). Then we can state:
.1 The sequence `(X+ - (X-  n))´ converges to (X) for every X  X. n
.2 The sequence `((X  m) - Y )´ converges to (X - Y ) for nonnegative X, Y  X, Y being bounded. m
.3 inf{|((X+  m) - (X-  n)) - (X)| | m, n  N} = 0 for X  X, and in addition

sup (-EQ[X] - (X)) = sup (-EQ[X] - (X))

for every probability content Q on (X) such that each X  X is integrable w.r.t. Q .

.4 If M  -1(R) with (X) = sup (-EQ[X] - (Q)) for all bounded X  X, then
QM
(X) = sup (-EQ[X] - (Q)) for all X  X.
QM

Proof:

The most important tool of the proof is Greco's representation theorem. The reader is kindly referred to [14]

(Theorem 2.10 with Remark 2.3). Since any   -1(R) is representable by a probability content, statement .2 follows immediately from Greco's representation theorem and Lemma 6.4.

proof of .1:

Let X  X, and let  > 0. Then there exists some probability content Q with (EQ|X) <  such that the inequality (X) -  < -EQ[X+] - (EQ|X) + EQ[X-] holds. Application of Greco's representation theorem leads

then to

(X) -  < -EQ[X+] - (EQ|X) + lim EQ[X-  n]  lim (X+ - (X-  n))  (X) nn

proof of .3:

Let Q be a probability content on (X) such that every X  X is integrable w.r.t. Q, and let X  X. Then for

 > 0 we may choose by statement .1 and Greco's representation theorem some n  N with

|

(X )

-

`-EQ [X +

-

(X -

(X -

17

Moreover, due to statement .2 and Greco's representation theorem again, there exists some m  N such that

|EQ [X +

- (X-

 n)] - EQ[(X+

 m) - (X-

 n)]|, |(X+

- (X-

 n)) - ((X+

 m) - (X-

 n))|

<

 3

We may conclude by

-EQ[X] - (X) < -EQ[(X+  m) - (X-  n)] - ((X+  m) - (X-  n)) +   sup (-EQ[Y ] - (Y )) +  Y Xb

and then sup (-EQ[X] - (X)) = sup (-EQ[X] - (X)). The rest of statement .3 follows easily from statements

XX

X Xb

.1, .2.

proof of .4:
By assumption ^ : X  R, X  sup (-EP[X] - (P)), is a well defined convex risk measure w.r.t.  with ^  
PM
and ^(X) = (X) for bounded X  X. In particular -^ 1(R)  -1(R), which implies that every   -^ 1(R) is representable by a probability content due to the assumptions on . Therefore the statements .1, .2 are also valid
for ^, following the same line of reasoning used in the proof of them. Then firstly, fixing  > 0, we may find for
X  X an integer n  N with
|^(X) - ^(X+ - (X-  n))|, |(X) - (X+ - (X-  n))| <  . 4
Furthermore there is some m  N such that
|^((X+  m) - (X-  n)) - ^(X+ - (X-  n))|, |((X+  m) - (X-  n)) - (X+ - (X-  n))| <  . 4
Thus |^(X) - (X)| < , and hence ^(X) = (X), which completes the proof.

In order to apply Lemma 6.5 we are now interested in conditions on  that ensure that linear forms from the domain of  are representable by probability contents. We shall succeed in providing a full characterization.

Proposition 6.6 Let X be a Stonean vector lattice. Then every linear form from -1(R) is representable by a probability content if and only if lim (-(X - n)+) = (0) for every  > 0 and nonnegative X  X.

converges

to

for nonnegative X  X. Hence, due to Greco's representation theorem (cf. [14], Theorem 2.10 with Remark 2.3)

 is representable by a probability content.

Conversely, let every linear form from the domain of  be representable by a probability content, and let  > 0 as
well as X  X be nonnegative. In view of Lemma 6.1 there is some c ]-(0), [ with (Y ) = sup (-(Y )-
{ c }
()) for any Y  X with -X  Y  0. In particular

|(-(X - n)+) - (0)|  sup (((X - n)+)) for every n.
{ c }

18

In view of Greco's representation theorem we have inf ((X - n)+) = 0 for any   -1(R). So by Lemma 6.3 n
we may apply the general Dini lemma as in the proof of Lemma 6.4 to conclude lim |(-(X - n)+) - (0)| = 0. n
This completes the proof.
Remark: If X is a Stonean vector lattice which consists of bounded positions only, then Proposition 6.6 is trivial.

7 Proof of Proposition 1.4 and Theorem 3.1

Throughout this section let L, E and S as in the context of Proposition 1.4 and Theorem 3.1. Furthermore X is assumed to be a Stonean vector lattice. The next two results are for preparation.

Lemma 7.1 Let X+b consist of all nonnegative bounded X  X, and let P be a probability measure on (X). Then

EP[X] = inf EP[Y ] for every X  X+b, and sup (-EP[X] - (X)) = sup (-EP[X] - inf (Z)).

XY E

X X+b

X E

X Z X

Proof:

Let us use the abbreviations c := sup (-EP[X] - (X)) and d := sup (-EP[X] - inf (Z)). Setting T :=

X X+b

X E

X Z X

r

{ \ A | A  S}, we have  P i1Gi | r  N, 1, ..., r ]0, [, G1, ..., Gr  T ¯  E, where 1A denotes the indicator

i=1

mapping of the subset A (cf. [14], Proposition 3.2). Since L generates (X), the inner Daniell-Stone theorem tells

us that P satisfies

P(A) = sup{P(B) | A  B  S} = inf{P(B) | A  B  T }

for every A  (X) (cf. [14], Theorem 5.8, final remark after Addendum 5.9).

Every nonnegative bounded function from X may be described as a lower(!) envelope of a sequence of simple

(X)-measurable mappings. This implies EP[X] = inf{EP[Y ] | X  Y  E} for all bounded nonnegative

X  X. In particular c  d. Moreover for any X  E and  > 0 there is some Y  X+b with Y  X and

inf (Z) +  > (Y ). This implies the inequalities -EP[X] - inf (Z)  -EP[Y ] - (Y ) +   c + . Hence

X Z X

X Z X

d  c, which completes the proof.

Lemma 7.2 Let P be a probability measure on (X) with sup (-EP[X] - (X)) < , where L+b = L  X+b
X L+b
with X+b consisting of all nonnegative positions from Xb. If condition (2) of Theorem 3.1 is satisfied, then every

X  X is P -integrable, and sup (-EP[X] - (X)) = sup (-EP[X] - (X)).

X Xb

Let X  X be nonnegative. It is an upper envelope of an isotone sequence (Xn)n of nonnegative simple
(X)-measurable mappings. Hence, in view of the monotone convergence theorem it remains to show that the
sequence (EP[Xn])n is bounded from above. Indeed, bearing (*) in mind, EP[Xn] - (-Xn)  c for each n, which
implies sup EP[Xn]  c + (-X). The proof is now complete.
n

Proof of Proposition 1.4: In view of Proposition 1.2  is lower semicontinuous w.r.t. the weak topology (X, F ) where F is the space of all bounded countably additive set functions on (X) such that every X  X is integrable w.r.t. any µ  F. This implies that  satisfies the Fatou property, and thus |Xb is continuous from above. The remaining part of Proposition 1.4 follows immediately from Lemma 7.1.

Proof of Theorem 3.1:
Let X+b, L+b consist of all nonnegative bounded positions from X and L respectively. For any  from the domain
of  assumption (4) ensures it may be represented by a probability content Q in the sense explained just before
Lemma 6.5 (cf. Proposition 6.6). Then condition (3), Lemma 6.2 and the inner Daniell-Stone theorem (cf. [14],
Theorem 5.8, final remark after Addendum 5.9) provide a probability measure P on (X) with P(A) = sup P(B)
ABS
for every A  (X) such that EP[Z] = (Z) holds for every Z  L  Xb (note that L  Xb generates (X) by assumption on L since L is a Stonean vector lattice). Then any X  X is P -integrable by condition (2) with Lemma 7.2. In particular we may define for every Z  L with positive and negative part Z+ and Z- respectively, via Yn := Z+  n - Z-  n a sequence (Yn)n in L  Xb which converges pointwise to Z and satisfies by
dominated convergence as well as the Greco theorem (cf. [14], Theorem 2.10) the idenities (Z) = lim (Yn) = n lim EP[Yn] = EP[Z]. This also means P  M1(S) because C  L. Applying Lemma 7.2 again, and bearing n
Lemma 6.5 with Proposition 6.6 in mind, we obtain (P) = sup (-EP[X] - (X))  (). Summarizing the X L+b
discussion we have shown
(*) For every  from the domain of  there is some P  M1(S) such that EP|L = |L and (P)  ().
After these preliminary considerations we are ready to prove Theorem 3.1.
Statement .1 is borrowed from [17] (p.12 there).
proof of statement .2:
In order to verify statement .2 we may use (*), and it remains to show that the sets c (c ](0), [) are compact
w.r.t. the topology L introduced in statement .1. For this purpose let (Pi)iI be a net in c with arbitrary

20

c ](0), [. So (EP|X)iI is a net in {  c}, which in turn is compact w.r.t. to product topology on RX by

Lemma 6.3.

Therefore there exist a subnet (Pi(k))kK

and

some





{



c}

with

lim k

EPi(k)

=

(X )

for

every X  X. Then (Pi(k))kK converges to some P  c due to (*). This finishes the prove of statement .2.

proof of .3:

Drawing on Lemma 6.5 with Proposition 6.6 and the translation invariance of  it remains to show

(X) = sup (-EP[X] - (P)) for all X  X+b.
PM1 (S )
For this purpose let X  X+b, and let  > 0. Then by (1), (2) and definition of E we may find an isotone sequence
(Yn)n in L+b with X  sup Yn  E and (X) < inf (Yn) + . In view of Lemma 6.1 and (*) there is some nn
c ] - (0), [ with (Yn) = sup (-EP[Yn] - (P)) for any n. Furthermore Fn(P) := -EP[Yn] - (P) defines
Pc
an antitone sequence of mappings Fn := c  R which are upper semicontinuous w.r.t. the relative topology of
L (see Lemmata 7.2, 6.5 again) such that Fn F, defined by F (P) := -EP[Y ] - (P). Due to .2 we may apply the generalized Dini lemma (cf. [12], Theorem 3.7) and obtain

(X) -  < inf (Yn) = sup (-EP[Y ] - (P))  sup (-EP[X] - (P))  (X),

n Pc

Pc

which completes the proof.

Proof of Remark 3.4:
Obviously, (X) = B(e)  B(T), and any closed subset A of e × T w.r.t. the metrizable topology e × T may be 
described by A = T Xn-1([xn, [) for some sequence (Xn)n of nonnegative continuous mappings and a sequence
n=1
(xn)n of positive real numbers.
Now let X  L. Then X(·, t) is B(e)-measurable for t  T and X(, ·) is continuous w.r.t. T for   , which
implies X  X because T is separably metrizable (cf. e.g. [3], Lemma III-14). Therefore L  X, and (X) is
generated by S. Then the statement of Remark 3.4 follows immediately from Theorem 3.1.

8 Proof of Theorem 4.1
Obviously, .2  .3, and statement .2 implies statement .4 if the indicator mappings 1A (A  S) belong to X. So in view of Corollary 3.3 and Proposition 1.1 it remains to prove the implications .1  .2 and .4  .3. proof of .1  .2:

Let Q consist of all sequences (n)n in [0, 1] with P n = 1. Aditionally, let (Xn)n be any isotone sequence in

9 Proofs of results from section 2
Proof of Lemma 2.1: It remains to show the if part. For this purpose let (Xi)iI denote a uniformly bounded net in Xb with pointwise limit X  Xb. Setting c := lim inf (Xi) and fixing  > 0, we may find a subnet (Xi(k))kK with (Xi(k)) < c + 
i
for every k  K. Hence (Xi(k) + c + )kK is a net in some Ar which converges pointwise to X + c + . So in view of condition (2.1) X + c +  is also the pointwise limit of some sequence (Yn)n from Ar. If  satisfies the Fatou property we may conclude (X + c + )  lim inf (Yn)  0, and hence (X)  c + . This completes the proof.

Proof of Theorem 2.2:
Let us retake assumptions and notations from Theorem 2.2
The implication .2  .3 is always valid as indicated in Proposition 1.4. Let us now introduce the space F^ consisting of all real linear forms on Xb which are representable by some µ  F. The operator norm · F^ on F^ w.r.t. the sup norm ·  satisfies R · dµ F^ = µ F for every µ  F. Since F is supposed to be complete w.r.t · F , (F^, · F^ ) is a Banach space. The topological dual F^ of F^ will be endowed with the respective operator norm · , and BF^ denotes the unit ball in F^ . Since F contains all Dirac measures, Xb may be embedded isometrically into F^ w.r.t. ·  and · by the evaluation mapping e^ : Xb  F^ . Next let us fix an arbitrary J  F^ outside the closure cl(e^(Xb)  BF^ ) of e^(Xb)BF^ w.r.t. the weak * topology (F^ , F^). By Hahn-Banach theorem we may find some (F^ , F^)-continuous real linear form  on F^ with
sup{(J~) | J~  cl(e^(Xb)  BF^ )} < (J). In addition there is some µ  F with (J~) = J~(R · dµ) for any J~  F^ . Without loss of generality we may assume
µ F = 1. Since e^ is isometric, we obtain then
Z J > sup{ X dµ | X  Xb, sup |X()|  1} = µ F = 1.

Hence e^(Xb)  BF^ is (F^ , F^)-dense in BF^ .
23

Now let condition (2.2) be valid, and let us assume that  satisfies the nonsequential Fatou property. Using Dirac measures  (  ), we may define for any J  F^ a mapping XJ  R via XJ () := J(R · ). Each XJ is bounded because |XJ ()|  J holds for every   . Furthermore for any J  F^ there exists a uniformly bounded net (Xi)iI in Xb such that (e^(Xi))iI converges to J w.r.t. (F^ , F^). In particular XJ is the pointwise limit of (Xi)iI , which means that it belongs to Xb due to (2.2). Hence the mapping ^ : F^  R, J  (XJ ) is
well defined with ^(e^(X)) = (X) for X  Xb. For every r > 0 and any net (Ji)iI in ^-1(] - , 0])  rBF^ we may select by Banach-Alaoglu theorem a subnet (Ji(k))kK and some J  rBF such that (Ji(k))kK converges to J w.r.t. (F^ , F^). Then (XJi(k) )kK is a uniformly bounded net in Xb which converges pointwise to XJ . Since  fulfills the nonsequential Fatou property, we obtain

^(J )

(XJ

Thus the sets ^-1(] - , 0])  rBF^ (r > 0) are (F^ , F^)-compact, which means that ^-1(] - , 0]) is closed w.r.t. (F^ , F^) by Krein-Smulian theorem. Now it is easy to check that -1(] - , 0])  Xb is closed w.r.t. (Xb, F ), which implies that all level sets -1(] - , c])  Xb (c  R) are (Xb, F )-closed due to the translation invariance

of . This shows statement .2, drawing on Propositions 1.2, 6.6 and Lemma 6.5. As a further consequence we have

equivalence of the statements .1 - .3 under (2.1), (2.2) in view of Lemma 2.1.

If we strengthen condition (2.2) by the assumption that the sets Ar from (2.1) are compact w.r.t. (X, F ), it remains to show the implication .2  .1. Indeed statement .2 implies that  is lower semicontinuous w.r.t. the weak

topology (X, F ) by Propositions 1.2. Furthermore for any uniformly bounded net (Xi)iI in Xb with pointwise limit X  Xb we may suppose without loss of generality that (Xi)iI is a net in some Ar due to translation invariance of . Then, drawing on relative (X, F )-compactness of Ar, the mapping X is the (X, F )-limit of (Xi)iI . This implies lim inf (Xi)  (X), and completes the proof.

Proof of Remark 2.4: Let e^ denote the evaluation mapping from Xb into the topological dual F of F w.r.t. the norm of total variation. It is isometric w.r.t. the sup norm ·  and the operator norm · . Then the if part is obvious in view of Banach-Alaoglu theorem. Conversely, translation invariance and relative (X, F )-compactness of the sets Ar imply the (F , F )-compactness of the sets e^(Xb)  rBF (r > 0), where BF denotes the unit ball w.r.t. · . This means that e^(Xb) is closed w.r.t. (F , F ) due to the Krein-Smulian theorem, and then e^(X) = F because Xb separates points in F, and thus e^(Xb) is dense w.r.t. (F , F ). The proof is finished.

A Appendix

Proposition A.1 Let (e, Fe) be a measurable space, and let {, e}  S  Fe be stable under finite union and

countable intersection, generating Fe. Furthermore, for every A  S there exists a sequence (An)n in S such that



e \ A = S An. Then every probability content Q on Fe is a probability measure if and only if lim Q(An) = 1

holds for any isotone sequence (An)n in S with S An = e.

n=1

Proof:

Let Q be a probability content on Fe, and let us denote  := Q |S. The only if part of the statement is obvious.

For the if part we want to show



(*) lim (An) = (A) for every isotone sequence (An)n in S with S An = A  S

n=1


Since for A, B  S with A  B there is by assumption an isotone sequence (An)n in S with S An = B \ A,
n=1
we may apply a version of the general extension theorem by K¨onig (cf. [13], Theorem 7.12 with Proposition 4.5).

Hence condition () together with the assumptions on S guarantee a probability measure P on the -algebra

Fe with P |S = , and P(A) = sup P(B) for every A  Fe. In particular P  Q which implies P = Q due to
ABS
additivity of Q and P . Therefore it remains to prove the condition ().

proof of (*):


Let (An)n be an isotone sequence in S with S An = A  S. By assumption there exists some isotone sequence

n=1 
(Bn)n in S with S Bn = e \ A. Then (Bn  A)n and (Bn  An)n are isotone sequences in S with S (Bn  An) =

e = S (Bn  A), and therefore lim ((Bn) + (An)) = 1 = lim (Bn) + (A). Hence lim (An) = (A),

which shows (*), and completes the proof.

B Appendix

Proof of Proposition 1.1:

Let X  X, and let +(X, ·) : X  R denote the respective rightsided derivative of  at X defined by +(X, Y ) :=

lim
h0+

(X+hY )-(X) h

.

satisfying

+(X, Y - X)  (Y ) - (X) for all Y  X. Then we may choose by Hahn-Banach theorem some linear form ~

on X with ~  +(X, ·). Moreover, we obtain for Z  0

~ (Z)  +(X, (X + Z) - X)  (X + Z) - (X)  0.

25

Therefore  := -~ is a positive linear form fulfilling (X - Y )  +(X, Y - X)  (Y ) - (X) for Y  X, and (Y )  (Y ) for Y  C. This implies |C =  due to linearity of |C and . Furthermore we have shown () = -(X) - (X). For the proof of the equivalence stated in Proposition 1.1 note that the only if part is obvious, the if part follows immediately from the Fenchel-Moreau theorem (cf. [2], Theorem 4.2.2), observing that () <  only if  is positive linear and extends  (see also Proposition 3.9 in [9]). This completes the proof.
