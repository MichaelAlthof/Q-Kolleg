Abstract
The utility maximisation problem is considered for investors with anticipative additional information. We distinguish between models with conditional measures and models with enlarged filtrations. The dual functions of the maximal expected utility are determined with the help of f -divergences. We assume that our measures are absolutely continuous with respect to a local martingale measure (LMM), but not necessarily equivalent. Thus we do not exclude arbitrage.

1 Introduction
In this paper we consider the utility maximisation problem for investors on financial markets who have some anticipative knowledge. These are investors who have some information which is relevant for the future price development, but which is not official and can not be obtained by observing

the price process or by reading the newspaper. Think, for example, of an investor knowing that a big trader is trying to keep the price of a certain asset below a fixed level during the next two weeks. More generally, suppose an investor knows that an event A will occur. In this case, he perceives the price process under a conditional measure P (·|A), where P is the original measure.
A different situation is given if an investor thinks about consulting an expert who has some knowlegde being of relevance for the financial market. For simplicity, suppose that the expert knows whether the event A will happen or not, and assume that this information would cost p > 0. In order to decide whether the investor should buy the information, we have to determine his additional expected utility before he gets the expert's information. This can be done by enlarging the set of his strategies: We allow him not only to use (Ft) adapted strategies, but also strategies which are adapted to the enlarged filtration (Ft  {A, Ac}). Summarising, we can distinguish two cases:
1. The investor knows that the event A will certainly happen. In this case he perceives the price process from the conditional measure P (·|A).
2. The investor will know whether A will happen or not. His information flow is represented by the enlarged filtration (Ft  {A, Ac}).
The first case describes the situation after the investor got the extra information, and the second case before he gets the additional information. In the second case the measure will switch either to P (·|A) or P (·|Ac). Let uA(x) and uAc(x) be the maximal expected utility under P conditioned on A and Ac respectively. By taking the average we obtain the expected utility in the second case, namely P (A)uA(x) + P (Ac)uAc(x). Thus initial enlargements of filtrations can be reduced to maximising the utility relative to conditional measures.
In order to solve the classical utility maximisation problem researchers have applied convex duality methods. We choose as a starting point the work by Kramkov and Schachermayer, [15] and [16], where the duality is anlaysed in the framework of the semimartingale model. Moreover, they represent the convex conjugate function of the maximal expected utility with the help of the equivalent local martingale measures (ELMM) of the underlying asset prices.
What about the utility maximisation problem under additional information? There exist solutions for enlarged filtrations. The first are [8] and [18]. Since then, their work was generalised by many authors. Just to mention a few, see [2], [1], [13] [12]. Most of these papers consider initial enlargements. Non-initial enlargements have been considered recently in [7], [5] and [4].

Baudoin introduced the concept of weak information (see [6]). In his model, the investors know in advance the distribution µ of a random variable G. The maximal expected utility has then to be maximised with respect to the whole set of equivalent measures under which the conditional distribution of G is given by µ. As a consequence, weak information leads to market uncertainty. In our case, however, we have certainty about the measure.
So far, most approaches assume that under the new information the market is still free of arbitrage, and hence, that there exist ELMMs. Thus, the maximisation problem can be solved with the classical methods. In this paper we will only assume that the conditional measures are absolutely continuous relative to P , i.e. P (·|A) P . As a consequence, ELMMs do not exist. However, the conditional measures are absolutely continuous with respect to a LMM. This is, as we will see, sufficient for deriving formulas of the dual function similar to the classical representations.

2 The model: starting from complete markets

Let (, F, (Ft), P ) be a filtered probability space, where (Ft) is a filtration satisfying the usual conditions. Let S be a continuous price process starting in zero and being a (Ft)-semimartingale with decomposition S = M +  · M, M . We assume the market to be complete. I.e. there exists a unique measure Q such that S is a local martingale relative to (Ft) and Q.
We denote by A(F) the set of all (Ft)-predictable processes  which satisfy 0 = 0 and which are integrable with respect to S and (Ft) in the usual sense (see Protter [19]). The elements of A(F) will be called strategies. Moreover, a strategy is called a-admissible if the stochastic integral process satisfies ( · S)t  -a, for all t  0. We fix a time horizon T > 0 and aim at maximising the utility of the wealth at time T . Given a utility function U , the maximal expected utility is defined by
uF (x) = sup{EU (x + ( · S)T ) :   A(F ) is x - admissible}.

We restrict the class of utility functions in order to simplify our analysis: let U be strictly increasing, strictly concave and continuously differentiable on (0, ). Furthermore we assume that U satisfies the Inada conditions

lim U (x) = 

and

lim U (x) = 0.

x0 x

Moreover let

V (y) = sup [U (x) - xy] , y  R,

be the convex conjugate function of -U (-x). Due to (1), V is the Legendre conjugate, i.e. V (y) = U ((U )-1(y)) + y (U )-1(y), y > 0. It can be shown
that V is a continuously differentiable, decreasing and strictly convex function satisfying limy0 V (y) = - and limy V (y) = 0. Furthermore, U is the Legendre conjugate of V , i.e. U (x) = V ((V )-1(-x)) + x (V )-1(-x),
x > 0. In the sequel, any pair of functions satisfying the mentioned proper-
ties of (U, V ) will be called Legendre pair. Note that also the function uF (x) is concave on (0, ). We can therefore
again define the conjugate

vF (y) = sup uF (x) - xy , y  R.
x>0
A sufficient and necessary condition for (uF , vF ) to be a Legendre pair was given by Kramkov, Schachermayer in [16].

Theorem 2.1. (Theorem 1 and 2 in [16]) (uF , vF ) is a Legendre pair if and only if vF (y) <  for all y > 0. Moreover,

vF (y) = EV

dQ y

.

dP

This theorem implies that the maximal expected utility depends on how

close the real measure P is to the risk neutral measure Q. Indeed, the value

EV

y

dQ dP

is a well-known distance between the two probability measures Q

and P , namely a so-called divergence. We now collect some basic definitions

we will need in the following.

Definition 2.2. Let µ and  be probability measures on the measurable space (, F). Moreover, let f : (0, )  R be a convex function, f (0) = limx0 f (x), and A a sub--algebra of F . The f -divergence of µ relative to  on A is defined as

fA(µ ) =

f

dµ d A

d,

if µ

 on A and the integral exists,

, else.

If f (x) = x log x, then f (µ ) coincides with the entropy of µ relative to . Crucial for us will be the next definition.

Definition 2.3. The reverse function of the convex function f is defined by

f^(x) = xf 1 , x  (0, ). x

Again we set f^(0) = limx f^(x).

4

Lemma 2.4. If f is strictly convex and differentiable on (0, ), then also the reverse function f^ is strictly convex and differentiable on (0, ). More-

over, if P  Q, then

fA(P Q) = f^A(Q P ).

Proof. For a proof of these properties see Lemma 1 in [10], or Theorem

1.13 in [17].

The conjugate function vF (y) in Thereom 2.1 is given as divergence with respect to the convex function x  V (yx). For simplicity we will use the notation Vy(x) = V (yx), x  0. Thus

vF (y) = (Vy)FT (Q P ) = (Vy)^FT (P Q) .

(2)

Finally, observe that the function Vy(x) is also convex in y, i.e. for all   (0, 1), and x, y, z > 0 we have

Vy+(1-)z(x)  Vy(x) + (1 - )Vz(x).

Conditional measures

Now let us consider the utility maximisation problem under conditional

measures.

For this let A  F and PA = P (·|A) =

P

1 (A)

P

(·



A).

If the

conditional measure PA is equivalent to P , then we obtain the dual function

by replacing P with PA in equation (2). We will prove that if they are

not equivalent, then the dual function still can be written as the reverse

Vy-divergence of PA relative to Q.

Theorem 2.5. Let vA(y) = (Vy)^FT (PA Q), y > 0. If vA(y) <  for all y > 0, then (uA, vA) is a Legendre pair.

Enlargement of filtrations
We will derive a similar result for an investor with information given by the filtration
Gt = Fs  (G), t  0,
s>t
where G is an arbitrary random variable with values in a polish space . For this let  be a regular conditional probability of P with respect to (G). Hence (·, ) is a probability measure and   (A, ) is (G)-measurable for all A  F.
If (Vy)^((·, ) Q) < , y > 0, then this function is the conjugate of the maximal expected utility u() relative to (·, ). We will show that there exists a (G)-measurable process Z such that Z(x) = u()(x), a.s. This allows us to derive a stochastic dual representation.

5

Theorem 2.6. Let Y (y) = (Vy)^FT ((·, ) Q), y > 0. If Y (y) < , a.s, then (Z, Y ) is a Legendre pair, a.s.
Note that Y (y) < , a.s, implies that (·, ) P , for almost all . This is similar to a condition introduced by Jacod in [14]. It guarantees that S remains a semimartingale with respect to (Gt).

the

Surprisingly, if A  FT and P (A) < 1, then there exists no LMM of S which is equivalent to PA. Suppose that there exists a LMM R which is equivalent to PA. Then the convex combination Rµ = µR + (1 - µ)Q is a LMM equivalent to P . Moreover, since P (A) < 1, we have Rµ = Q. This,
however, is a contradiction to the completeness under P . One can even show
that there exists arbitrage under PA:

Theorem 3.1. If A is FT -measurable and P (A) < 1, then the market admits arbitrage under PA.

Proof. Let c > 0, and f = 1A - c1Ac such that EP [f ] = 0. Due to completeness, there exists a strategy  such that ( · S)T = f . Moreover, ( · S)t = EQ[f |Ft]  -c, which shows that  is admissible. Note that under PA, ( · S)T = 1. Therefore  is an arbitrage strategy relative to PA.
We now aim at determining the maximal expected utility under the measure PA. For this let (FtA) the smallest filtration containing (Ft  {A, Ac})

6

and all PA-null sets, and put
uA(x) = sup{EPA[(U (x + ( · S)T )] :  (FtA)-predictable, x-adm. and S-integrable relative to PA}.
We start with the following observation.
Lemma 3.2. uA(x) is equal to the maximal expected utility where the supremum is taken only over all (Ft)-predictable processes which are x-admissible and integrable with respect to P . As a consequence, uA(x) <  for all x > 0.

Proof. We have to show that uA(x) is equal to
u~(x) = sup{EPA[(U (x + ( · S)T )] :  (Ft)-predictable, x-adm. and S-integrable relative to P }.

Every strategy integrable relative to P is also integrable relative to PA (see f.e. Theorem 25, Chapter IV in [19]), and therefore u~(x)  uA(x). For the reverse inequality let Gt = Ft  {A, Ac}. Denote by P(F ) and P(G) the predictable -fields with respect to (Ft) and (Gt) respectively. We show at
first

P(G) = {(  (A × R+))  (  (Ac × R+)) : ,   P(F )} . (3)

Note that the RHS is a -algebra which is contained in P(G). Moreover, each set of the form (B  A)×]s, t] or (B  Ac)×]s, t], B  Fs, belongs to the RHS. Therefore, P(G) is a subset of the RHS, and hence equation (3)
holds. A monotone class argument implies that every (Gt)-predictable process
may be written as a sum of the form 1A + 1Ac, where  and  are (Ft)predictable. Now assume that  is an x-admissible and bounded strategy. It
is straightforward to show, via stopping for example, that  and  may be
chosen to be bounded, x-admissible and hence S-integrable relative to P . As a consequence, the maximal expected utility obtained by using (Gt)-
predictable strategies is equal to u~(x) (here we also use the fact that u~(x) can be attained with bounded strategies). Since (FtA) is the filtration (Gt) completed by the PA-null sets, the proof is complete.

We define now

vA(y) = (Vy)^(PA Q) ,

and for the rest of the section we assume that vA(y) <  for all y > 0. We have to show that (uA, vA) is a Legendre pair. We will deduce this from

7

Thereom 2.1. For this we approximate the measure PA with the measures P = (1-)PA+P ,   (0, 1). Observe that P is equivalent to P . Moreover, the measure Q is the unique ELMM of S relative to P. Therefore, we may apply the Thereom 2.1 to the maximal expected utility under P. By taking limits we will obtain the result.
At first we define
u(x) = sup{EP[(U (x + ( · S)T )] :  (Ft)-predictable, x-adm. and S-integrable relative to P }

and show that u(x) converges to uA(x). Lemma 3.3. Let x > 0. Then

lim
0

u(x)

=

uA(x).

Proof. Let  be (Ft)-predictable, S-integrable and x-admissible relative to P . Put XT = x + ( · S)T and assume that U (XT ) is P -integrable. Then on the one hand, lim0 EP[U (XT )] = EPA[U (XT )], and therefore lim inf0 u(x)  uA(x) (see Lemma 3.2).
On the other hand, EP[U (XT )] = EP [U (XT )] + (1 - )EPA[U (XT )],
which implies
u(x)   u(x) + (1 - )uA(x).

Consequently, lim sup0 u(x)  uA(x), and thus the result.

Now let v(y) be the conjugate function of u(x). By Theorem 2.1 we

have

v(y) = EP V

y dP dQ

= (Vy)^FT (P Q)

We will show that v converges to vA as   0. But before, we need the following.

Lemma 3.4. The function vA is decreasing, differentiable and strictly convex on (0, ). Moreover,

lim
y0

vA(y)

=

-,

lim
y

vA(y)

=

0.

Proof. Our assumptions on U imply that V , and thus y  (Vy)^(z) (with

z > 0), is strictly convex, decreasing and differentiable on (0, ). Therefore,

also vA(y) is strictly convex and decreasing on (0, ).

It is known that for any convex function the left and right derivatives ex-

Thus

vA(y)

has

showing that vA is differentiable on (0, ). Since limy0 V (y) = -, mono-

tone convergence implies limy0 vA(y) = limy0

d dy

dQ = -.

Finally, since limy V (y) = 0, we obtain with dominated convergence,

limy vA(y) = limy

d dy

dPA dQ

dQ = 0.

We now prove the remaining properties needed for (uA, vA) to be a Legendre pair.

Lemma 3.5. The function vA is the dual function of uA, i.e.

vA(y) = sup [uA(x) - xy] , y > 0,
x>0

uA(x)

=

inf
y>0

[vA(v)

,

x > 0.

Moreover, uA is strictly concave and differentiable on (0, ), and

lim
x0

uA(x)

=

lim
x

uA(x)

=

0.

As a consequence, (uA, vA) is a Legendre pair; and Theorem 2.5 is shown.

Proof. By Lemma A.2 there exists a non-negative and convex function
g such that all g-divergences coincide with the (Vy)^-divergences up to some constant. To simplify notation, we assume that (Vy)^ is already non-negative. Therefore, since z  (Vy)^(z) is convex (y > 0),

(Vy )^

(Vy )^A

dP dQ

dQ = (Vy)^A (PA Q) = vA(y).

It remains to show that the limit vA is indeed the conjugate function of uA. By Theorem 2.1, the functions v are differentiable and strictly convex on

9

(0, ). Let w and w denote the inverse function of the derivative of v and vA respectively. Convexity implies that on (0, ) the derivatives of v converge pointwise to the derivative of vA (see Theorem 25.7 in [20]), and hence

lim
0

w(z)

=

w(z).

Since (u, v) is a Legendre pair,

u(x) = v(w(-x)) + xw(-x).

Moreover, v converges uniformly on each closed bounded set of (0, ) (see Theorem 10.8 in [20]). By letting   0, we obtain with Lemma 3.3

uA(x) = vA(w(-x)) + xw(-x), x > 0.

This shows that uA is the dual function of vA, and hence, that vA is dual to
uA. Since vA is strictly convex, we have limx0 uA(x) =  (see Theorem 26.3
in [20]). Finally, limx uA(x) = 0. If this were not the case, then vA(y) = supx>0[uA(x) - xy] were not finite for all y > 0, which is a contradiction to our assumption. Thus the proof is complete.

We close this section by considering special utility functions.

Proposition 3.6. (Logarithmic utility)

Let

U (x) =

log x

for

all

x

>

0.

Then

w(-x)

=

1 x

and

the

maximal

expected

utility is equal to the relative entropy of PA with respect to Q, i.e.

uA(x) = log(x) + H(PA Q).

Proof. Observe that the dual of the logarithm is given by V (y) = - log(y)-

1, hence

(Vy )^(x)

=

x(-

The conjugate is given by

therefore

Moreover,

uA(x) = xw(-x) - 1 - log(w(-x)) +

Example 3.8. Let (, F, P ) be the 1-dimensional canonical Wiener space equipped with the Wiener process (Wt)0t1. More precisely,  = C([0, 1], R) is the set of continuous functions on [0, 1] starting in 0, F the -algebra of Borel sets with respect to uniform convergence, P the Wiener measure and W the coordinate process. Let (Ft)0t1 be the completed natural filtration generated by W .
11

We consider a financial asset with price process described by the stochastic exponential of W , i.e.

St = E(W )t, 0  t  1.

Note that S satisfies (PRP) relative to (Ft). Moreover, let A  F1 such that

P (A) > 0. Then H(PA P ) =

1A log

1 P (A)

dPA = - log P (A), and thus

the maximal expected logarithmic utility relative to PA is given by

uA(x) = log(x) - log P (A).

4 Enlarging filtrations with finite partitions

Throughout this section let P = {A1, . . . , An} be a finite partition of  into F-measurable sets. We will study the utility maximisation problem under the enlarged filtration

Gt = Fs  (P), t  0.
s>t
Recall that the maximal expected utility is given by uG(x) = sup{EU (x + ( · S)T ) :   A(G) is x - admissible}.

Definition 4.1. The conditional maximal expected utility relative to the partition P is defined by

n
Z(x) = 1Ai uAi (x),
i=1

x > 0.

Lemma 4.2.

EZ(x) = uG(x).

Proof. Let   A(G). Observe that i = 1Ai  A(G), and 1Ai( · S)t = (i · S)t. Therefore,

n

EU (x + ( · S)T ) =

P (Ai)E[U (x + (i · S)T )|Ai]

i=1

n

 P (Ai)uAi(x),

i=1

12

and thus uG(x) is smaller than the LHS. For the reverse inequality, observe

that Lemma 3.2 implies that the maximal expected utility uAi(x) can be attained by using strategies in A(F). Consequently, for every  > 0 and i,

we may choose i  A(F ) such that E[U (x+(i·S)T )|Ai]  uAi(x)-. Then,

=

n i=1

1Ai

i

 A(G), and EU (x + ( · S)T )  - +

i P (Ai)uAi (x).

Hence the proof is complete.

The results of the preceding section imply that the stochastic convex con-
jugate of -Z(-x), defined by Y (y) = supx>0[Z(x) - xy] (y > 0), is given by
nn
Y (y) = 1Ai vAi (y) = 1Ai (Vy)^(PAi Q).
i=1 i=1
For later use we rewrite Y as a divergence of two measures on the product space ¯ =  × . The first measure is the image of P under the embedding  :   ¯ ,   (, ). We put P¯ = P  -1. The other measure is the product Q¯ = Q  P .

Lemma 4.3. Let A = FT  (P). Then

Y (y) =

dP¯ (Vy)^ dQ¯ A dQ, y > 0.

Proof. Note

that

An analogue of Lemma 4.2 is true for the expected utility conditioned on G. One could try to prove this directly with the same idea, however, one would have to show tedious details. Among other things, we would have to check measurability and S-integrability of processes (, t)  tG()(), where g  A(F) for all g  . Instead of doing so, we derive the generalisation with the help of a monotone convergence property which is interesting for its own.

5 Monotone utility convergence

Let (Htn) be an increasing sequence of filtrations with usual conditions and such that Htn  Ft. Moreover, let
Ht =  (Hsn : n  1) .
s>t
Throughout we assume that the price process S is a continous semimartingale with respect to all filtrations (Ft), (Htn) and (Ht). Moreover, we suppose that the maximal expected utility uH(x) relative to (Ht) is finite, and that there exists a (Ht)-predictable process such that the Doob-Meyer decomposition is given by

t
St = S0 + Mt + sd M, M s, t  0,
0

If limx U (x) = , then the existence of such a decomposition follows already from the finiteness of uH(x) (see [3]). Since (Htn) is increasing, the
sequence of the related maximal expected utility is also increasing. Indeed,

as will be shown below, it satisfies a monotone convergence property. We

will apply this result later in order to prove Theorem 2.6. Note that we do

not assume here that (Htn) is an initial enlargement of (Ft). To simplify notation, let un(x) denote the maximal expected utility with

respect to (Htn). We start with the observation that the utility maxi-

mum can be attained by L2-integrable strategies. Given a filtration (Gt),

we denote by L2G(M ) the set of all (Gt)-predictable processes  such that

Lemma 5.1. Let x > 0. Then

uG(x) = sup{EU (x + ( · S)T ) :   LG2 (M )  A(G), (x - ) - adm. for some  > 0}.

(4)

Proof. We prove at first for all x > 0

uG(x) = sup sup{EU (x + ( · S)T ) :   A(G), (x - ) - adm.} (5)
>0

We have only to show that the LHS does not exceed the RHS. For this let

  A(G) such that EU (x + ( · S)T ) > -.

and hence uG(x) is smaller than RHS of equation (5). In equation (4) the RHS is obviously not greater than the LHS. For
the reverse inequality choose  > 0 and an (x - )-admissible strategy  satisfying EU (x + ( · S)T ) > -. Due to (5) it is sufficient to show that EU (x + ( · S)T ) is not bigger than the RHS of (4). Since  is S-integrable, the stopping times

converge almost surely to T for n  . Note that the strategies n = 1[0,Tn] are (x - )-admissible and belong to LG2 (M ). Fatou's Lemma implies

and thus the result.

Here is the main theorem of this section.

Theorem 5.2. Let x > 0. Then

lim uHn(x) = uH(x).
n

Proof. Let   LH2 (M ) be (x - )-admissible. The stopping times
t
k = T  inf{t  0 : s2 d M, M s  k}

converge to T , a.s, and hence

By Lemma 5.1 it suffices to show that for all k  1, EU (x + ( · S)k ) is not greater than supn uHn(x). To simplify notation we assume that k = T for some k.
Now let n be the projection of  onto L2Hn. By Doob's inequality there is a constant C > 0, such that

E((n - ) · S)T  E((n - ) · M )T + E((n - ) · M, M )T  ((n - ) · M )T 2 + E((n - ) · M, M )T  C ((n - ) · M )T 2 + E(|n - ||| · M, M )T .

The first summand in the preceding line goes to 0, because (n) converges to

 in LH2 (M ). The second vanishes due to Kunita-Watanabe and due to our

assumption that

Consequently,

by

and hence the result.

We close this section with an example showing that Theorem 5.2 is not valid without the assumption that S is continuous.

Example 5.3. Let T > 1 and  a standard normal random variable. Suppose the price process is given by

1, if 0  t < 1,

St =

1 2

,

if 1  t  T,

and let (FtS) be the completed filtration generated by S. Moreover let (n)

be a sequence of independent normal random variables with mean zero and

Var(n)

=

1 n

.

We

define

Htn = Ft  (1{||1} + n), 0  t  T,

and claim that

uHn(x) = U (x)

for all x > 0. For this let  be (Htn)-predictable and S-integrable. If 1 = 0 a.s., then the integral ( · S)1 is unbounded from below and hence  is not
admissible. Since the process S is constant on the remaining part of the trading interval, we have uHa n(x) = U (x). A trader having access to

Ht = Htn
n1

knows whether the absolute value of  is bigger or smaller than 1. Therefore

he has access to non-trivial admissible trading strategies. As a consequence uF (x) > U (x), and hence

lim uHn(x) = uH(x).
n

By the way, the price process S satisfies the (NFLVR) property with respect to (Ht).

6 General initial enlargements
Let us now consider investors with additional information represented by an enlarged filtration
Gt = Fs  (G), t  0,
s>t
where G is an arbitrary random variable with values in a polish space . In Section 4 we considered filtrations enlarged by a finite partition. An approximation through discretisation will allow us to generalise the results.
We will write the dual of the conditional expectation as a reverse Vydivergence of the two measures P¯ and Q¯ on the product space ¯ =  × . Recall that P¯ is the image of P under the embedding  :   (, ), and Q¯ = Q  P .
Note that the embedded price process S¯(,  ) = S() is a Q¯-local martingale with respect to the filtration F¯t = s>t Fs  (G). The product measure Q¯ plays the role Q had in the old setting.
We abbreviate A = FT (G). Throughout we assume that (Vy)^A P¯ Q¯ is finite for all y > 0. In particular, P¯ Q¯ on A.
Let (Pn) be a sequence of finite partitions of (G) such that (G) = n (Pn), and Pn  Pn+1. We denote by un(x) the maximal expected utility under the filtration enlarged by (Pn). Then monotone utility convergence implies that limn un(x) = uG(x). As before, for all A  Pn, we denote by uA(x) the maximal expected utility under PA and the filtration enlarged by (Pn). Again, let Zn(x) = APn 1A uA(x) be the conditional expected utility with respect to Pn.
Lemma 6.1. Let x > 0. Then (Zn(x)) is a submartingale with respect to the filtration Hn = (Pn), n  1. Moreover, (Zn(x)) is uniformly integrable and convergent in L1.
Proof. Let n  1, and A  Pn. Since Pn  Pn+1, there are sets B1, . . . , Bk in Pn+1 such that A = B1  . . .  Bk. Obviously
E[1AZn(x)] = P (A)uA(x)  P (B1)uB1(x) + . . . + P (Bk)uBk (x) = E[1AZn+1(x)].
Therefore E[Zn+1(x)|Hn]  Zn(x), for all n  1, which means that (Zn(x)) is a submartingale.
Note that uA(x)  U (x), and hence Zn(x)  U (x), a.s. Assume for simplicity that U (x)  0 (else consider Zn(x)-U (x)). Then CC P (A) uA(x) 
17

uG(x) < , for every subset C  Pn. In particular
E [Zn(x); Zn(x)  M ]  uG(x),
showing that the submartingale (Zn(x)) is uniformly integrable. As a consequence, it converges in L1 (see f.e. Chapter 4 in [9]).

Definition 6.2. The L1-limit Z(x) = limn Zn(x) will be called conditional expected utility relative to G. Note that Z(x) is (G)-measurable, and for all B  (G) with P (B) > 0, we have uB(x) = B Z(x) dP .
We apply now the results of Section 4 to our approximations Zn(x): Lemma 4.3 implies that the stochastic conjugate of Zn(x) is given by
dP¯ Yn(y) = (Vy)^ dQ¯ FT (Pn) (,  ) dQ(), y > 0,
P -almost surely. We claim that Yn(y) converges to dP¯
Y (y) = (Vy)^ dQ¯ FT (G) (,  ) dQ().
More precisely:
Lemma 6.3. The processes Y (y) and Yn(y) are strictly convex, decreasing and differentiable on (0, ), almost surely. The derivatives satisfy
lim Y (y) = -, and lim Y (y) = 0.
y0 y
Moreover, for almost all  the functions y  Yn(y) converge pointwise to y  Y (y) on (0, ), and the derivatives Yn(y) converge to the derivative Y (y).

Proof. With similar arguments as in Lemma 3.4 one can show the first

and second statement. For the third, let y > 0. Note that (Vy)^FT (Pn) P¯ Q¯ converges to (Vy)^A P¯ Q¯ (see Lemma A.1). Assume that (Vy)^ is strictly

positive, else choose a modification as in Lemma A.2. As a consequence, the

sequence (Vy)^

dP¯ dQ¯ FT (Pn)

converges to (Vy)^

dP¯ dQ¯ A

in L1(Q¯). More-

over, (Vy)^

dP¯ dQ¯ FT (Pn)

is a uniformly integrable submartingale relative

to Q¯, and therefore it converges Q¯-almost surely. By Fubini's theorem,

(Yn(y)) converges to Y (y) for almost all .

We now apply the following well-known fact from convex analysis: If

(fn) is sequence of convex functions converging on a dense subset to a finite

18

function f , then (fn) converges to f everywhere and f is convex. Moreover (fn) converges uniformly on every bounded set (see Theorem 10.8 in [20]).
In order to apply this result to our processes (Yn), let D be a countable dense subset of (0, ). For any q  D we have limn Yn(q) = Y (q) almost surely, and therefore, for almost all , the functions y  Yn(y) converge pointwise to y  Y (y) on (0, ).
Finally, another result from convex analysis implies that the derivatives
converge almost surely, i.e. limn Yn(y) = Y (y) (see Theorem 25.7 in [20]).

Due to the previous lemma we may define

d -1

d -1

Wn(z) = dy Yn

(z), and W (z) = Y dy

(z), z < 0.

Note that Lemma 6.3 implies limn Wn(z) = W (z), a.s.

Theorem 6.4. For almost all , the two processes (Z, Y ) are a Legendre pair. Moreover, uG(x) = E[xW (-x) + Y (W (-x))], for x > 0.

Proof. We have to show that Z(x, ) = xW (-x, ) + Y (W (-x, ), ) for almost all . According to Theorem 2.6

Zn(x, ) = xWn(-x, ) + Yn(Wn(-x, ), ),
almost surely. Moreover, by Lemma 6.3, for almost all  the functions y  Yn(y) converge pointwise to y  Y (y) on (0, ). Since these functions converge uniformly on every closed bounded subset of (0, ), we have

lim
n

Yn(Wn(x,

),

)

=

Y

(W

(x,

),

),

and hence Z(x) = xW (x) + Y (W (x)), almost surely. This shows that Z
and Y are dual. The properties of Y imply that limx0 Z(x) = , and limx Z(x) = 0, almost surely. Finally, the last statement follows from uG(x) = E[Z(x)].

Proof to Theorem 2.6. Let  be a regular conditional probability of P with respect to (G). Then, on A, we have
(d,  ) dP¯ dQ() = dQ¯ (,  ).

Therefore, Theorem 2.6 is just a reformulation of Theorem 6.4.

19

Q¯ as a martingale measure

Under the product measure Q¯ the new information (G) is independent of the old information FT . Therefore, Q¯ can be referred to as a decoupling
measure. This measure was used in [3] in order to derive, with the Girsanov-
Lenglart Theorem, semimartingale decompositions relative to (Gt). If the conditional probabilities (·, ) are equivalent to P , then there exist mea-
sures on the original space which decouple the new from the old information.
The utility maxisation problem in this case has been considered in [1]. The measure Q¯ is not the only local martingale measure of the embedded
process S¯(,  ) = S() with respect to the filtration (F¯t): if P  P on (G), then RP is a martingale measure equivalent to Q¯. However, among all these measures R  P , the measure Q¯ minimises the entropy relative to P¯.
In order to sketch the proof, let P denote the set of probability measures P equivalent to P and defined on (G). Then R  P  Q¯ and, since P¯ R  P , we also have P¯ R  P for all P  P. Note that

inf H(P¯ R  P ) = inf

It is straightforward to show that the right hand side attains its infimum if P = P , and hence Q¯ is the entropy minimising martingale measure for S¯ with respect to the enlarged filtration (F¯t).
We close again the section by considering special utility functions.

Then

W (-x)

and

the

utility is equal to the relative entropy of P¯ with respect to Q¯, i.e. uG(x) =

log(x) + H(P¯ Q¯).

Remark 6.7. For the logarithm we need not to consider the conditional expected utility, in order to generate the conjugate function of uG(x). Recall Z(x) = infy>0[xy + Y (y)]. By taking expectations we obtain
EZ(x) = H(P¯ Q¯) - 1 + inf [xy - log(y)],
y>0
and hence the conjugate of uG(x) is given by
vG(y) = - log(y) + H(P¯ Q¯) - 1.

7 Additional logarithmic utility

The properties of the logarithm lead to simple formulas for the additional logarithmic utility of an investor with information Gt = s>t Fs  (G) compared to an investor having only access to (Ft).
Theorem 7.1. If U = log, then the utility difference u = uG(x) - uF (x) does not depend on x, and it is equal to the mutual information between FT and G, i.e.
u = HFT (G)(P¯ P  P ) = I(FT , G).
In particular, if G is discrete and FT -measurable, the additional utility is equal to the absolute entropy of G relative to P ,

u = - P (G = g) log P (G = g).
g

Proof. Let f (,  ) =

dP¯ dQ¯

FT (G) and g() =

dQ dP

FT .

We show at first

that

dP¯

f (,  )g() = d(P  P ) FT (G).

(6)

21

For this let A  FT and B  (G). Note that

1A×B(,  )f (,  )g() d(P  P ) = 1A×B(,  )f (,  ) d(Q  P )
= 1A×B(,  )f (,  ) dQ¯ = P¯(A × B),
which implies (6). Now recall that uG(x) = log(x) + H(P¯ Q¯) and uF (x) = log(x) + H(P Q). Thus
uG(x) - uF (x) = H(P¯ Q¯) - H(P Q) = log f (,  ) - log g-1() dP¯

= log f (,  )g() dP¯

dP¯ = log
d(P  P ) FT (G) = HFT (G)(P¯ P  P ).

dP¯

Finally, if G is discrete and FT -measurable, then u is equal to the absolute entropy of G.

Remark 7.2. Let Ht = s>t Fs  (H) be another initially enlarged filtration such that (H) is a sub--field of (G). Then the logarithmic utility difference uG - uH is equal to the mutual information of FT and G conditioned on H, which is defined by I(FT , G|H) = I(FT , G) - I(FT , G) (see
[11]).

Maximal expected utility for non-initial enlargements
So far we considered initial enlargements of a given filtration and we determined the conjugate function of the maximal expected utility conditioned on the enlarging random variable. What can we do, if the filtration is not only enlarged in the beginning, but at any moment during the trading period? Can we still determine a conjugate of the maximal expected utility?
Due to monotone utility convergence we can approximate general enlargements by piecewise initial enlargements of the filtration: the trading interval is devided into small subintervals, and in the beginning of each subinterval the filtration is enlarged initially. Naturally, the idea arises to apply our results to each subinterval, and thus derive again a dual representations of the maximal expected utility via f -divergences. Unfortunately

22

there is the following problem: Let t be a point in the trading interval (0, T ). The maximal utility up to time T is in general not the sum of the maximal utility up to time t and the maximal utility between t and T . It is shown in [5] that the logarithm is essentially the only utility function to have this property. So let for the remaining section U = log.
Let (Ht) be a filtration. We will maximise logarithmic utility with respect to the enlarged filtration

Gt = (Fs  Hs).
s>t

We approximate (Gt) with piecewise initially enlarged filtrations. For this let for any partition  : 0 = t0  . . .  tn = T ,

Gt = (Fs  Hti ) if t  [ti, ti+1[.
s>t

According to Remark 7.2, the additional logarithmic utility relative to (Gt)

is given by u(x) = I(FT , Ht0) +

n-1 i=0

I (FT

,

Hti+1

|Hti

,

Fti+1

).

Now let

(n) be a sequence of partitions such that n  n+1 and limn |n| = 0.

Monotone utility convergence implies uG(x) = limn un(x). As a con-

sequence, the sums I(FT , Ht0) +

n-1 i=0

I

(FT

,

Hti+1

|Hti

,

Fti+1

)

converge,

and we denote the limit as the mutual information between the filtrations

(Ft) and (Ht). We have thus shown the following result.

Theorem 7.3. Let U = log. Then the logarithmic utility difference uG - uF is equal to the mutual information between (Ft) and (Ht), i.e.

n-1

uG - uF = lim
n

I(FT , Ht0 ) +

I(FT , Hti+1 |Hti , Fti+1 ) .

i=0

A similar result has already been derived in [4], however, in a completely different way.

A Appendix: f -Divergences

Lemma A.1. (see Theorem 1.30 in [17]) Let (An) be a sequence of increasing sub--fields and A = (fAn(P Q)) is an increasing sequence and

n An. Then

lim
n

fAn

(P

Q) = fA(P

Q).

Lemma A.2. Let f be a finite convex function on (0, ). Then there exists a non-negative and convex function g and a constant C  R such that for all P Q we have g(P Q) = f (P Q) + C.

23

Proof. If f is bounded from below, then put g(x) = f (x) - C, where C is the minimal value of f .
Now suppose that limx f (x) = -. Then f (x)  f (1) + f (1)(x - 1), for all x > 0. Therefore, g(x) = f (x) - f (1) - f (1)(x - 1) is a non-negative convex function. Moreover, for all P Q, we have

g(P Q) =

g dP dQ = -f (1) + dQ

= -f (1) + f (P Q),

f dP dQ - f (1) dQ

dP - 1 dQ dQ

and thus the result.
