Abstract This paper extends the class of stochastic AK growth models with a closed-form solution to the case where there are two capital goods in the model. To be precise, we consider the Uzawa-Lucas model of endogenous growth with human and physical capital. The extension holds, even if an external effect in the use of human capital in goods production occurs. Using the "guess and verify" method, we determine the value function of the social planner in the centralized economy and the value function of the representative agent in the decentralized case. We show that the introduction of income taxes on wages and of a subsidy on physical capital earnings is able to help the decentralized economy in reaching the social optimum, while keeping the policy maker's budget balanced. Then the time series implications of the model's solution are derived. In Appendix to the paper the uniqueness of the value functions is proved by using an alternative method. Key words: closed-form solution, value function, saddle path stability, endogenous growth JEL Classifications: C61, C62

1 Introduction
In this chapter, we present the value function of a stochastic version of the Uzawa (1965) and Lucas (1988) model of endogenous growth in discrete time. The externality of human capital in goods production inherent to the model causes a difference between the social planner's solution and the market outcome. We pay attention to this fact by treating both cases separately and by presenting both the social planner's and the representative agent's value function. The chapter generalizes the results of Bethmann (2002) where a deterministic version of this model was examined. Furthermore, we show that the inefficiency of the decentralized economy can be overcome by introducing taxes and subsidies on factor compensations.
The main feature of the Uzawa-Lucas model is the fact that the agents have to allocate their human capital between two production sectors. On the one hand, there is a goods sector where a single good usable for consumption and physical capital investment is produced. This sector exhibits a production technology that uses human and physical capital. On the other hand, there is a schooling sector where agents augment their stock of human capital. Here, human capital is the only input factor. In short, agents have to "learn or to do" (Chamley, 1993). In his seminal paper, Lucas (1988) argues that the economy's average level of human capital contributes to total factor productivity in goods production. In a decentralized economy the individual's accumulation of human capital has no appreciable influence on this average level and agents are only compensated for their respective factor supplies. This incentive structure leads to non-efficient equilibria. Since agents are not able to coordinate their actions, their discounted utility could be higher without making a single agent worse off. As a result, the solution for the centralized economy deviates from that of the decentralized case.
The theoretical model considered here differs from that studied by Lucas (1988) in two ways. First, there is our choice of the utility function. We assume logarithmic preferences which imply that the constant intertemporal elasticity of substitution is equal to one. This assumption reduces the number of parameters by one and simplifies the calculations. Second, we assume discrete time where the two capital stocks depreciate fully at the end of the period. This way the closed-form solution of the stochastic one sector growth model with logarithmic preferences and full depreciation of physical capital (cf. McCallum, 1989) is extended to the case with two capital goods.
The chapter is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the model. Section 3 presents the value function in closed form as the solution to the social planner's dynamic optimization problem (DOP). In Section 4 we present the value function of the representative agent. Section 5 shows that the solutions are saddle path stable and determines their time-series implications. Section 6 summarizes our results and concludes. Appendix proves the uniqueness of the value functions found in the third and fourth section by using an alternative method.
2 The model
We consider a closed economy populated by an infinite number of homogeneous, infinitelylived agents. The representative agent enters every period t with predetermined endowments of human and physical capital, ht and kt, respectively. Furthermore, there are two sectors in the economy. Firms produce a single homogeneous good and a schooling sector provides educational services.
2

2.1 The household

The population is assumed to be constant and normalized to one. The representative agent has logarithmic preferences over sequences of consumption:



U (c0, c1, ..) = Et

t ln (ct) ,

t=0

(1)

where ct is the level of consumption in period t  N0 and   (0, 1) is the subjective discount factor. Expectations are formed over the sequence of shocks {t}t=0 entering goods production. The logarithmic utility function implies that the intertemporal elasticity of substitution is equal to one. In each period, agents have a fixed endowment of time, which is normalized to one unit. The variable ut denotes the fraction of time allocated to goods production in period t. Furthermore, as agents do not benefit from leisure, the whole time budget is allocated to the two production sectors. The fraction 1 - ut of time is spent in the schooling sector. Note that in any solution the condition

ut  [0, 1]

(2)

has to be fulfilled. The variables ct and ut are the two control variables of the agent. When maximizing her discounted stream of utility, the agent has to pay attention to the following budget constraint:

rrtkt + wwtutht = ct + kt+1,

t  N0,

k0 > 0,

(3)

where kt is the agent's physical capital stock in period t. The terms rrtkt and wwtutht are, respectively, the net returns on physical capital and work effort after taxation. We assume that both parameters r and w are positive. If the parameter r is smaller than 1, we have a tax on physical capital, if it is larger than 1, we have a subsidy. The same is true for the parameter w. If w < 1, work effort is taxed, if w > 1, work effort is subsidized. Hence, the rates of taxation are given by r - 1 and w - 1, respectively. The above constraint implies full depreciation of physical capital. The variables rt and wt are market-clearing factor prices. Prices and tax rates are endogenous to the model. The former via the market clearing mechanism and the latter via the government's balanced budget condition. Despite this fact, prices and tax rates are taken as given by the representative agent. The left-hand side describes her income derived from physical capital plus the income stemming from effective work, which is determined by the worker's level of human capital ht multiplied by the fraction of time spent in the goods sector in period t, i.e. htut. We assume that the initial values k0 and h0 are strictly positive. On the right-hand side, the spending of the agent's earnings appears, which she can either consume or invest. Another constraint the agent has to keep in mind is the evolution of her stock of human capital when allocating 1 - ut to the schooling sector.

2.2 The schooling sector

The creation of human capital is determined by a linear technology in human capital

only:

ht+1 = B (1 - ut) ht, t  N0, h0 > 0,

(4)

where we assume that B is positive1. If we set ut in equation (4) equal to zero, we get the potential stock of next period's human capital. If we set ut equal to one, tomorrow's

1The case when B equals 0 corresponds to the neoclassical growth model.

3

stock of human capital is equal to zero. The schooling technology implies that the potential marginal and average product of human capital coincide and are equal to B, whereas the realized marginal and average products are equal to B (1 - ut). Note that the depreciation rate of human capital is 100 percent per period.

2.3 The goods sector

We assume an infinitely large number of profit-maximizing firms producing a single good. They are using a Cobb-Douglas technology in physical capital kt and effective work htut. Furthermore, the average skill of workers ha,t has a positive influence on total factor productivity. Hence, output yt is determined by:

yt = Atkt (utht)1- ha,t.

(5)

The parameter  is the output elasticity of physical capital and we assume   (0, 1). The parameter  is non-negative and measures the degree of the external effect of human capital. If we set ut equal to one, we get the potential output in the goods sector. The homogeneity of the agents implies that:

ha,t = ht,

t  N0.

(6)

The state variable At denotes total factor productivity. Throughout this chapter, we assume that ln At follows a first-order autoregressive process, i.e.:

ln At+1 =  ln At + t+1, t  N0 and   N 0, 2 .

(7)

This assumption is a generalization of Bethmann (2002), where A was taken as fixed. The firm has to rent physical and human capital on perfectly competitive factor markets. In the decentralized economy, the representative firm's profit  in period t is given by:

 (kt, ht; At, ha,t) = Atkt (utht)1- ha,t - rtkt - wtutht,

where the semicolon indicates that the whole paths of ha,t and At are treated as exogenous by the representative firm. The first-order necessary conditions for the profit-maximizing factor demands are:

rt



yt kt

=

yt kt

and

wt



yt  (ut ht )

=

(1-)yt ut ht

.

(8)

These market-clearing factor prices ensure that the zero-profit condition holds. Inserting the prices into the agent's budget constraint (3) yields:

ryt + w(1 - )yt = ct + kt+1, t  N0.

(9)

2.4 The state sector in the decentralized economy
In each period t, we require the state's budget to be balanced. Therefore:

(r - 1) rtkt = (1 - w) wtutht

(10)

must hold for all t  N0. This means that if we consider a tax on physical capital returns, we are subsidizing work effort at the same time and vice versa. This remark ends the
presentation of the model. In Section 3, we solve the centralized version of this model.

4

3 The centralized solution of the model

In the centralized economy, the social planner internalizes the contribution of the economy's average level of human capital to goods production. That is, the planner is able to reach the efficient allocation of resources without the instrument of taxation. Therefore, we assume r =w =1 throughout this section.
The central planner internalizes the social returns of human capital when choosing his optimal controls. This means that he exploits the symmetry condition stated in equation (6) and writes his DOP as follows:

U = sup E0
{ct ,ut }t=0


t ln ct
t=0

,

with respect to the state dynamics

kt+1 = Aktut1-h1t -+ - ct, ht+1 = B (1 - ut) ht, ln At+1 =  ln At + t+1,
kt  0 and ht  0,

 t  N0,  t  N0,  t  N0,  t  N0.

(11) (12) (13)

Since the social planner uses the symmetry from (6), he has simply dropped the index
a. Furthermore, the initial values k0, h0, and A0 > 0 are assumed to be given and the social planner has to ensure that

ct > 0 and 0  ut  1

hold for all t  N0. He defines the value function as the solution to his optimization problem from time t onwards:

V (kt, ht, At)  sup Et
{cs ,us }s=t


s-t ln cs
s=t

s.t. (11), (12), and (13).

The Bellman equation associated with the planner's DOP is given by:

V (kt, ht, At) = sup {ln ct + Et [V (kt+1, ht+1, At+1)]} .
ct ,ut

(14)

The first-order necessary conditions for the optimal consumption choice and the optimal allocation of human capital between the two sectors are given by:

ct : ut :

1 ct

= Et

 Vt+1  kt+1

,

ut =

Et

Vt+1 kt+1

(1-)At

Et

Vt+1 ht+1

B

1 
,kt
-
ht 

(15) (16)

where Vt stands for V (kt, ht, At) and the asterisk denotes optimality. Equation (15) describes the behavior along the optimal consumption path. When shifting a marginal unit of today's output from consumption to investment, today's marginal change in utility should equal the expected discounted marginal change of wealth with respect to tomorrow's capital stock. Equation (16) states that the weighted expected marginal change of wealth with respect to physical capital equals the weighted expected marginal

5

change of wealth with respect to human capital. The first weight is the marginal product of human capital in goods production, given a certain choice of ut. The second weight is the potential marginal product of human capital when the remaining fraction of human capital is allocated to the educational sector.
We now turn to the Euler Equations. The envelope property with respect to physical capital is straightforward. Together with the above first-order necessary conditions (15) and (16), it gives rise to the following Euler equation in consumption:

= E .1 1 yt+1
ct t ct+1 kt+1

(17)

This is the Lucas asset pricing equation (cf. Lucas, 1978) with the constant of relative risk aversion being equal to one. Along the optimal consumption path, marginal utility of consumption in time t must be equal to the discounted expected marginal utility from the return on investment in the next period. The envelope condition for the stock of human capital is given by:

Vt ht

= Et

Vt+1 B(1-+ut)

 ht+1

1-

.

(18)

The last term on the right-hand side, ut, indicates that the expected marginal social gain of exploiting the external effect in goods production has an impact on the evolution of the shadow price of human capital. To be precise, today's shadow price of human capital is positively influenced by the degree of the external effect of human capital in goods production. This is the mechanism by which the external effect enters the second Euler equation along the optimal allocation of human capital between the two sectors:



ut

=

ct+1 kt+1

(1-+ ut+1 )yt+1

.

(19)

The transversality conditions with respect to the two capital stocks that establish the sufficiency of the two Euler equations (17) and (19) are given by:

lim T E0
T 

kyT
cT kT T

=0

and

lim T E0
T 

h(1-+uT )yT

cT uT hT

T

= 0.

(20)

The conditions (20) assert that the intertemporal budget constraints are met by the planner's decisions. Since the social planner exploits the external effect of human capital, the derivative of the production function with respect to human capital looks different from that in a decentralized economy below. This derivative is the sum of the private marginal return from utht and the marginal social gain of the average stock of human capital ht.
Using the guess and verify method, it is possible to generalize Robinson Crusoe's value function V and the planer's value function found in Bethmann (2002) as follows:

V =  + B ln B + A ln At + k ln kt + h ln ht,

(21)

where the i's, with i  {k, h, B, A}, are defined as follows2:

B

:=

(1-+) (1- )2 (1-

)

,

A

:=

1 (1-)(1-)

,

k

:=

.

The function V implies the following controls along the welfare-maximizing consumption and human capital allocation paths:

ct = (1 - ) yt

and

ut

=

(1-)(1-) 1-+

:=

u

.

(22)

Note that 0  u  1 is satisfied even in the strict sense. Furthermore, the allocation of human capital is constant regardless of the respective endowments of human and physical capital. The central planner simply devotes a constant share of goods production to consumption. Surely, findings (22) must also hold in period T such that it is easy to see that the Euler equations (17) and (19) and the transversality conditions (20) are satisfied. This remark closes the discussion of the centralized case. In the next section we turn to the decentralized economy.

4 The decentralized solution of the model
In the decentralized case, we assume a representative agent with rational behavior. The agent knows that her stock of human capital equals the average level of human capital in the economy. Furthermore, she knows that the external effects of human capital in goods production, captured by the term ha,t, may increase her and all the other agents' wealth. But here, in the decentralized case, the market mechanism prevents a coordination of agents' actions. This can be understood as a Nash game producing the prisoner's dilemma. For this reason, we introduce a government that taxes and subsidizes the respective factor compensations. In the first subsection we write down the representative agent's optimization problem. Then, the second subsection characterizes the agent's optimal behavior. Finally, the third subsection determines the government's optimal taxation policy.

4.1 The representative agent's optimization problem

Although the external effect of the economy's average human capital stock in period t may be not exploited, the whole path of ha,t is predictable and is therefore treated as given by the agents. The representative agent's DOP is given by:

U = sup E0
{ct ,ut }t=0


t ln ct
t=0

,

with respect to the state dynamics

kt+1 = rrtkt + wwtutht - ct, ht+1 = B (1 - ut) ht, ha,t+1 = B (1 - ua,t) ha,t, ln At+1 =  ln At + t+1,
kt  0 and ht  0,

 t  N0,  t  N0,  t  N0,  t  N0,  t  N0.

(23) (24) (25) (26)

The variable ua stands for the average human capital allocation in the decentralized economy, the value of which cannot be influenced by the representative agent.
We start the analysis of the decentralized economy with the definition of the value function as the solution to the representative agent's problem:



V (kt, ht; At, ha,t)  sup Et

s-t ln cs

{cs ,us }s=t

s=t

s.t. (2) - (8).

7

Note that the value function of the representative agent is restricted to a given path of ha,t. The corresponding Bellman equation is given by:

V (kt, ht; At, ha,t)  sup {ln ct + Et [V (kt+1, ht+1; At+1, ha,t+1)]} .
ct ,ut

(27)

Taking the derivatives with respect to the two controls and inserting the market-clearing factor prices (8) gives us the following first-order necessary conditions:

ct : ut :

1 ct

= Et

 Vt+1  kt+1

,

ut =

Et

Vt+1 kt+1

(1-)w At

Et

Vt+1 ht+1

B

1 
,kt ha,t
ht

(28) (29)

where Vt+1 is a shortcut for V (kt+1, ht+1; At+1, ha,t+1). Equation (28) is very standard and characterizes the effect of shifting one unit of today's output from consumption to investment. Today's marginal change in utility should equal the expected discounted marginal change in tomorrow's wealth with respect to tomorrow's capital stock. Equation (29) considers the shifting of a marginal unit of human capital from the goods production sector to the schooling sector, or vice versa. The condition states that the marginal change in goods production due to this shifting, weighted by the expected shadow price of physical capital, should equal the marginal change in the schooling sector weighted by the expected shadow price of human capital. Using the envelope property of the optimal decision rules:

ct = c (kt, ht; At, ha,t) and ut = u (kt, ht; At, ha,t) ,

(30)

leads us to the following envelope conditions:

= E ,Vt
kt

Vt+1 r yt

t kt+1

kt

and

Vt ht

= Et

 Vt+1  ht+1

B.

These conditions together with the above first-order necessary conditions along the optimal consumption path (28) and for the optimal allocation of human capital (29) imply the following Euler equations:

= E ,1 1 ryt+1
ct t ct+1 kt+1

ut =

Et

1 r yt+1 ct+1 kt+1

Et

1 yt+1 ct+1 ut+1ht+1

At B

.kt ha,t

(31) (32)

The two Euler equations (31) and (32) are necessary for a policy to attain the optimum. Together with the following transversality conditions they are also sufficient:

lim T Et
T 

k1 ryT
cT kT T

=0

and

lim T Et
T 

h1 w(1-)yT

cT uT hT

T

=0

(33)

Note that the first fraction in both conditions is the derivative of the utility function and the second fraction is the derivative of the goods sector production function with respect to the inputs of physical and human capital. To be more precise, the last derivative is taken with respect to the fraction of human capital that is allocated to the goods sector, i.e. utht. These derivatives are multiplied by the respective state variable. The transversality conditions tell us that the expected discounted marginal utility of an additional unit of the capital stocks in the "last period" is equal to zero. These requirements rule out that the agent plays Ponzi games.

8

4.2 The representative agent's optimal decisions
Again, it is easy to check that a generalized version of Robinson Crusoe's value function and of the representative agent's value function V found in Bethmann (2002) satisfies the Bellman equation (27) and the first order necessary conditions (28) and (29) simultaneously:

V (kt, ht; ha,t) =  + B ln B + A ln At + k ln kt + h ln ht + ha ln ha,t, where the i's, with i  {k, h, ha, B, A}, are defined as follows3:

k

:=

 1-

,

B

:=

(1-+) (1- )2 (1-

)

,

h

:=

1- (1-)(1-)

,

A

:=

1 (1-)(1-)

.

ha

:=

 (1-)(1-)

,

The optimal controls implied by V are the following:

(34)

ct = (1 - ) yt

and

ut

=

w (1- )  +w (1- )

.

(35)

If the government sets w and r equal to 1, these results correspond exactly to the deterministic case examined in Bethmann (2002). V implies a constant allocation of human capital between the two production sectors, i.e. the evolution of the average stock of human capital ha does not enter the first-order necessary condition for ut in (35). Hence, there is no linkage between the representative agent's decision and the economywide average decision. Therefore the solution strategy of determining the evolution of the agent's stock of capital and then exploiting the symmetry condition (6) is equivalent to the strategy of finding a fixed point where the representative agent's policy rules coincide with the economy-wide average decisions. Hence, the equation:

ha,t+1

=

B

  +w (1- )

ha,t

.

determines the path of the economy-wide average level of human capital in the decentralized economy. Together with the agent's optimal controls, this result implies that the Euler equations (31) and (32) and the transversality conditions (33) are met.

4.3 The government's optimal policy

The government wants to reach the social planner's solution by taxing, respectively subsidizing the agent's factor compensations. Note that the absence of r in the first order conditions (35) implies that the planner's solution can be reached by simply requiring ut to be socially optimal. On the other hand, assumption (10) requires that the state has to ensure that its budget is balanced in each period. These two requirements lead us to the following two conditions:

(1-)(1-) 1-+

=

w (1- )  +w (1- )

and

(r - 1)  = (1 - w) (1 - ) .

(36)

This implies the following optimal values of w and r:

w

=

1- 1-+

and

r

=

-2 + (1-+)

.

3The constant is given by:  

(1-) ln[w ] (1-)(1-)

-

(1-+) ln[+w (1-)] (1-)(1-)2

.

ln[1-] 1-

+

(1-) ln[1-] (1-)(1-)

+

 ln  (1-)(1-)

+

(1-+) ln  (1- )2 (1- )

+

Hence, the compensation of work effort is reduced by the ratio of the output elasticities of human capital in the decentralized and centralized economy, i.e. by the ratios of private and social marginal returns of human capital in goods production. These tax revenues are then distributed to the owners of the physical capital stock. This result is very intuitive and leads to an increased goods production in the decentralized economy.4 Note that the planner's and the representative agent's value functions are identical if we apply the above condition on w and use (6).
In the last two sections, we have studied both the centralized as well as the decentralized version of the Uzawa-Lucas Model of Endogenous Growth. We have found the two value functions and shown that the implied controls satisfy the Euler equations and the transversality conditions. In the next section, we show that the solutions are saddle path stable and determine their time-series implications.

5 Stability properties and time series implications of the solutions

In this section, the aim is twofold. First, we want to determine the stability properties

of the two solutions. Second, we want to characterize the time-series properties. Lucas

(1988) points out that the growth rate of human capital along the balanced growth

path is given by B(1 - ubgp). Furthermore, he shows that the growth rates of physical

capital,

output,

and

consumption

are

1-+ 1-

times

the

growth

rate

of

human

capital.

Mulligan and Sala-i-Martin (1993) use this property in order to introduce transformed

state-like and control-like variables. These new variables remain constant along the

balanced growth path. This stationarity together with the fact that the number of state

variables is reduced by one makes the analysis of growth models much simpler. Benhabib

and Perli (1994) follow this strategy and define the state-like variable xt and the control-

like variable qt. In principle, we apply the same strategy and argue that the DOP

is homogeneous in the initial conditions h0 = ha,0 and k0. However, as in Bethmann (2002) and Bethmann and Reiß (2003), our consideration leads us to a different definition

of the control-like variable qt5.

Because of the homogeneity in the initial conditions of the central planner's DOP, we

define the state-like variable xt and the control-like variable qt as follows:

xt :=

kt
1-+

ht 1-

and

qt :=

.ct
1-+

ht 1-

Similarly, the representative agent's DOP is homogeneous in its initial conditions. The only difference is that we must distinguish between the representative agent's stock of human capital h and the economy-wide average stock of human capital ha. Therefore we redefine the state-like variable xt and the control-like variable qt as:

xt := kt
htha1,-t 

and

qt := ct  .
htha1,-t 

4Uhlig and Yanagawa (1996) present an opposite result. They study a two period OLG model with endogenous growth where lower labor income taxes correspond to higher capital income taxes. Thereby the young generation is able to generate higher savings which in turn lead to higher growth.
5The first paper studies a discrete time version of the deterministic Uzawa Lucas Model of Endogenous Growth with full depreciation of human and physical capital while the second refers to continuous time and no depreciation. In both papers, we apply the same definition of q as we do here. On the other hand, Benhabib and Perli (1994) use q = c/k.

10

The state-like variable can be interpreted as a weighted ratio of the two capital stocks. In the deterministic model, the state-like variable xt remains constant along the balanced growth path. Here, we consider a stochastic model such that xt may sometimes be above or below its balanced growth path where the dynamics stem from the physical capital stock since our solutions imply that h evolves deterministically both in the centralized as well as in the decentralized case. In Section 4 we have shown that the government is able to force agents to make socially optimal decisions, i.e. to internalize the external effects stemming from the economy-wide average stock of human capital. Therefore this section focuses on the decentralized case. The representative agent's solution is fully described by the policy rules (35) together with the laws of motion for kt, ht, ha,t, and At. Using our results, the dynamics of total factor productivity, of the state-like variable, and of the control-like variable are described by the following equations:

ln At+1 =  ln At + t+1

xt+1 =

The evolution of the logged state-like variable x^ is described by a stochastic first-order

difference equation with stable root  and stochastic disturbance a^. Hence the logged

where the constant term on the right-hand side is the unconditional mean of the log state-like variable x^. Since the control-like variable qt is non-ambiguously determined by At and xt, we conclude that the whole system is saddle-path stable. Furthermore, the control-like variable qt follows an AR(2) process:

6 Summary and concluding remarks
We have proven that the functions (21) and (34) are the value functions of the social planner and of the representative agent, respectively. We can use these functions and the first order necessary conditions along the optimal consumption paths in order to find the optimal level of consumption. The result is the typical consumption rule for the standard AK model with logarithmic preferences, Cobb-Douglas technology, and full depreciation of physical capital. It is easy to check that this result does fit the Euler equation in consumption (31). Similarly, we can use (34) and the first order necessary condition for the optimal human capital allocation (29). We find that the optimal way to shift human capital between the two production sectors is to hold ut constant, once we have found the optimal allocation. Similar to the consumption rule, it can be shown that this policy rule fulfills the Euler equation (32). Furthermore, the restriction ut  [0, 1] holds. The transversality conditions in (33) ensure that the policy rules (35) of the representative agent are necessary and sufficient for a utility maximizing path. In the centralized case, the optimal stock of human capital employed in the goods sector ut is a little bit smaller than in the decentralized case without taxation, although ut  [0, 1] still holds. Hence, the path of human capital in the centralized economy lies above the human capital path in the decentralized economy given the same initial stocks of capital.
Finally, we have shown that the time series properties of the model are similar to those of the standard neoclassical growth model when looking at the detrended time series. This is due to the fact that the optimal human capital allocation is a constant and thus unaffected by the state variables. As a consequence, the growth rate of human capital is always equal to B(1 - ubgp). Hence, the introduction of the schooling sector does not change the dynamics of the model.

A Appendices

A.1 Finding the value function by iteration
In Sections A.2 and A.3 of this appendix, we will use an iterative method to find the value functions that attain the suprema of the two DOPs considered in Sections 3 and 4. We introduce some basic concepts of stochastic dynamic programming from the textbook by Stokey and Lucas (1989) and finally formulate Theorem 9.12. This verification theorem states that under certain conditions a solution to the Bellman equation is necessary and sufficient even in the stochastic unbounded returns case.
Let (X, X ) and (Z, Z) be any measurable spaces, and let (S, S) := (X × Z, X × Z) be the product space. The set X is the set of possible values for the vector of endogenous state variables, Z is the set of possible values for the exogenous shock, and S is the set of possible states of the system. The evolution of the stochastic shocks is described by a stationary transition function Q on (Z, Z).
In each period t, the decision-maker chooses the vector of endogenous states in the subsequent period. The constraints on this choice are described by a correspondence  : X × Z  X; that is, (x, z) is the set of feasible values for next period's state variables if the current state is (x, z). Let A be the graph of :

A = (x, y, z)  X × X × Z : y  (x, z) .

Let F : A  R be the per-period return function. Hence F (x, y, z) gives us the current period return if the current state is (x, z) and y  (x, z) is chosen as next period's vector of endogenous state variables. The constant one-period discount factor is denoted by  and we assume   (0, 1). The givens for the problem at hand are (X, X ), (Z, Z), Q, , F , and .
In period 0, with the current state (x0, z0) known, the decision maker chooses a value for x1. In addition, he makes contingency plans for periods t  N. He realizes that the decision to be carried out in period t depends on the information that will be available at that time. Thus he chooses a sequence of functions, one for each period t  N. The t-th function in this sequence specifies a value for xt+1 as a function of the information that will be available in period t. For t  1, this information is the sequence of shocks (z1, z2, .., zt). The decision maker chooses this sequence of functions to maximize the expected discounted sum of returns, where the expectation is over realizations of shocks. We define the following product spaces:

(Zt, Zt) = (Z × .. × Z, Z × .. × Z),

t times

t times

for all t  N. Furthermore let zt = (z1, .., zt)  Zt denote a partial history of shocks in periods 1 through t.

Definition 1. A plan is a value 0  X and a sequence of measurable functions t : Zt  X, t  N.
Hence, in period t with the partial history of shocks zt, the function t(zt) tells us the value of next period's states xt+1.
Definition 2. A plan  is feasible from (x0, z0)  S if
(1a) 0  (x0, z0),

13

(1b) t(zt)  [t-1(zt-1), zt].
Let (x0, z0) denote the set of plans that are feasible from (x0, z0). This set is nonempty if the correspondence  is nonempty and a certain measurability constraint is met.
Assumption 1.  is nonempty-valued and the graph of  is (X × X × Z)-measurable. In addition,  has a measurable selection; that is, there exists a measurable function h : (X, Z)  X such that h(x, z)   (x, z) for all (x, z) S.
Under this assumption, the set (x0, z0) is nonempty for all (x0, z0)  S.6 A plan  constructed by using the same measurable selection h from  in every period t is said to be stationary or Markov, since the action it prescribes for each period t depends only on the state [t-1(zt-1), zt] in that period. Nonstationary plans can be constructed by using different measurable selections ht in each period. Let a feasible plan and the transition function Q on (Z, Z) be given. We want to calculate the total, discounted, expected returns associated with this plan. Given the initial state (x0, z0)  S, we define the following probability measures µt(z0, ·) : Zt  [0, 1]:

µt(z0, Z) = ..

Q(zt-1, dzt)Q(zt-2, dzt-1)..Q(z0, dz1),  t  N.

Z1 Zt-1 Zt

The domain of the per-period return function F is the set A, the graph of . Then we can define the set A as:

A= C X ×X ×Z :C A .

Under Assumption 1, A is a -algebra. Furthermore, if F is A-measurable, then for any (x0, z0)  S and any   (x0, z0),
F [t-1(zt-1), t(zt), zt] is Zt-measurable,  t  N.

This rationalizes our next assumption.

Assumption 2. F : A  R is A-measurable, and either (a) or (b) holds.

(a) F  0 or F  0

(b) For each (x0, z0)  S and each plan   ,

F [t-1(zt-1), t(zt), zt] is µt-integrable,  t  N,

exists (although it may be plus or minus infinity).

Assumption 2 ensures that, for each (x0, z0)  S, we can define the functions un(·, x0, z0) : (x0, z0)  R, n  N0, by:

u0(, x0, z0) = F [x0, 0, z0],

n

un(, x0, z0) = F [x0, 0, z0] +

tF [t-1(zt-1), t(zt), zt] µt(x0, dzt).

t=1 Zt

6A proof of this result can be found in Lucas and Stokey (1989), page 243.

14

The value of un(, x0, z0) is the sum of expected discounted returns in periods 0 through n from plan  if the initial state is (x0, z0). Assumption 2 also ensures that for each (x0, z0)  S we can define u(·, x0, z0) : (x0, z0)  R¯ to be the limit of the series as the horizon recedes:

u(,

x0,

z0)

=

lim
n

un(,

x0,

z0).

Thus u(, x0, z0) is the infinite sum of expected discounted returns from the plan  if the initial state is (x0, z0). Under Assumptions 1 and 2, the function u(·, x, z) is well defined on the nonempty set (x, z), for each (x, z)  S. In this case we can define the supremum function v : S  R¯ by:

v(x, z) = sup u(, x, z).
(x,z)

That is v is the unique function satisfying the following two conditions:

v  u(, x, z), all   (x, z); v = lim u(k, x, z), for some sequence {k} in (x, z).
k

In the bounded returns case, a solution v to the functional equation must have the property that the expected discounted value of the implied policy in the very far future is equal to zero, that is we exclude for example sustained overinvestment. The difficulty with the unbounded returns case is that there may be some (x0, z0)  S and   (x0, z0) for which the condition:

lim t
t

v[t-1(zt-1), zt]µt(z0, dzt) = 0,
Zt

  (x0, z0),

 (x0, z0)  S

(37)

does not hold. For each (x0, z0)  S, however, we can define ^ (x0, z0) to be the subset of (x0, z0) on which this condition holds. Then define v^ : S  R by

v^(x, z) = sup u(, x, z)
^ (x,z)

Clearly v^  v. The following theorem provides sufficient conditions for the two functions to be equal.

Theorem 3. Let (X, X ), (Z, Z), Q, , F , and  satisfy Assumptions 1 and 2. Let , ^ , u, v, and v^ be as defined above. Suppose v is a measurable function satisfying the functional equation

v(x, z) = sup F (x, y, z) +  v(y, z)Q(z, dz) ,
y(x,z)
and that the associated policy correspondence G is nonempty and permits a measurable selection. For each (x, z)  S, let (·, x, z) be a plan generated by G from (x, z). Suppose in addition that (a) (·, x, z)  ^ (x, z); and
(b) for any (x0, z0)  S and   (x0, z0), there exists ^  ^ (x, z) such that u(^, x, z)  u(, x, z).
Then v(x, z) = v^(x, z) = v(x, z) = u((·; x, z), x, z), (x, z)  S.
Proof. See Stokey and Lucas (1989), page 274.
In the next sections we will apply this theorem to our model.

A.2 The centralized economy

The social planner's optimization problem can be rewritten such that in every period t
the states kt and ht are given and next period's states kt+1 and ht+1 have to be chosen, i.e. we want to replace the variables ct and ut. Equation (9) can be solved for ct and the resulting expression can be substituted into the utility function. Similarly, we solve
equation (4) for utht and insert the result into the production function. In terms of the state variables, the planner's maximization problem is now given by:

such that

sup E0
{kt+1 ,ht+1 }t=0


tF (kt, ht, kt+1, ht+1, At)
t=0

F (kt, ht, kt+1, ht+1, At) = ln

-

ht+1 B

1- ht - kt+1

,

0 < ht+1 < Bht, 0 < kt+1 < Atktht1-+ ,
ln At+1 =  ln At + t+1.
Hence, let (ht, kt)T  X = R+2 + and At  Z = R++ with the Borel sets X and Z. Let   (0, 1) and let:

(kt, ht, At) =

(kt+1, ht+1) Atkt

and

F (kt, ht, kt+1, ht+1, At) = ln

ht+1 B

1- ht -kt+1

,

where   (0, 1) and   [0, ). Let the exogenous shocks be serially correlated with

E[ln At+1] =  ln At. In order to apply Theorem 3, we want verify that Assumptions 1 and 2 hold; find (v, G) and construct the plan (·; x, z), for all (x, z)  S, and show that

the hypotheses (a) and (b) hold.

Clearly Assumption 1 holds: (k, h, A) =  and there are lots of measurable selections,

for example,

h(ht,

kt,

At)

=

(

1 2

Bht,

1 2

At

kt

h1t -+

)



(ht,

kt,

At).

To establish that Assumption 2 holds, note first that the per-period return func-

tion F t1-1(At-1), t2-1(At-1), t1(At), t2(At), At is µt(A0, ·)-integrable and second that for any (ht, kt, At) and any   (ht, kt, At) for all t  N:

ln t1-1(At-1) < t ln B + ln h0

(38)

t-1 t-1

ln t2-1(At-1) <

i ln At-1-i + (1 -  + ) i ln t1-2-i(At-2-i) + t ln k0

i=0 i=0

holds. Using the first inequality (38), we may further simplify the second and finally arrive at the following condition:7

t-1

ln t2-1(zt-1) <

i ln At-1-i +

t 1-

+

t -1 (1-)2

i=0

È7Note, that

Applying the expectations operator with respect to the information set available in period 0 to all At-1-i gives:

(1 -  + ) ln B

(39)

Since F (ht, kt, ht+1, kt+1, At)  F (ht, kt, 0, 0, At) holds for the per-period return function, we know that:

F t1-1(At-1), t2-1(At-1), t1(At), t2(At), At  ln At + (1-+) ln t1-1(At-1) +  ln t2-1(At-1)

(40)

must also hold. Hence for any triple (h0, k0, A0) and for any feasible plan , the sequence of expected one period returns satisfies:

E0 [F (·, t)]

<

t ln A0 + 

t -t -

ln A0 +

(1 -  + ) ln B

(1-+ )(1-t+1 ) 1-

where F (·, t) := F (kt, ht, kt+1, ht+1, At). Then for any feasible plan, the expected total returns are bounded from above:

 ln k0 1-

.

We know from Section 3 that:

v(h, k, A) =  + h ln h + k ln k + A ln A + B ln B

(41)

is a solution to the functional equation. The coefficients i, with i  {h, k, A, B}, are defined as follows:

h

:=

1-+ (1-)(1-)

,

k

:=

 1-

,

A

:=

1 (1-)(1-)

,

and

B

:=

(1-+) (1- )2 (1-

.

Indeed these coefficients imply that the function v(h, k, A) is below the upper bound. The policy functions associated with v are given by:

(1-+) 1-+

(42) (43)

Hence, given any initial state (h0, k0, A0), the plan 1[·, h0, k0, A0] generated by the first
policy rule can be calculated explicitly. Using this plan we can also calculate the second plan 2[·, h0, k0, A0]; in logs, they are:

ln t1-1[·, h0, k0, A0] =
ln t2-1[·, h0, k0, A0] =

It only remains to be shown that conditions (a) and (b) of Theorem 3 hold. In order to verify that the plans 1[·, h0, k0, A0] and 2[·, h0, k0, A0] satisfy (a), we have to show that (37) holds for all (h0, k0, A0) when applying 1[·, h0, k0, A0] and 2[·, h0, k0, A0],
where v is given by (41). In our case we consider:

Using the fact that 0 <  < 1, 0 <  < 1, and E0 [ln At] = t ln A0, it is straightforward to show that condition (37) indeed holds.8
In order to verify condition (b), we need to show that for any initial state (h0, k0, A0) in S, any plan in (h0, k0, A0) is weakly dominated by a plan in ^ (h0, k0, A0). Let (h0, k0, A0)  S and   (h0, k0, A0) be arbitrary. By definition   ^ (h0, k0, A0) if and only if (37) holds. With v given by (41), the condition (37) reads as follows:

lim
t

tE0

 + h ln t1-1[At-1] + k ln t2-1[At-1] + A ln At + B ln B

= 0.

It follows from the assumptions on the At's that:

lim
t

tE0

A ln At

=

lim

()t

0.

Hence (37) holds if and only if:

lim
t



tE0

h ln t1-1[At-1] + k ln t2-1[At-1]

= 0.

(44)

That is,   ^ (h0, k0, A0) if and only if condition (44) holds. In addition, we know from (38) and (39) that for all (ht, kt, At) and any   (ht, kt, At) for all t  N:

lim
t



t

E0

ln t1-1[At-1]

0

and

lim
t



t

E0

ln t2-1[At-1]

(45)

must hold. Now suppose that  / ^ (h0, k0, A0), i.e. (44) fails to hold. It follows from the inequality in (40) that:



u (, h0, k0, A0)  E0

t ln At + (1 -  + ) ln t1-1[At-1] +  ln t2-1[At-1] .

t=0

Since (44) fails, the conditions in (45) imply that this series must diverge to minus infinity: u (, h0, k0, A0) = -; in this case 1 and 2 dominate 1 and 2. Thus condition (b) is satisfied, and Theorem 3 applies. That is, v is indeed the value function and the
policy rules are given by (42) and (43). This ends the discussion of the centralized case.
In the next subsection we turn to the decentralized economy.

8Note, that for   (0, 1), limt tt = 0 holds.

18

A.3 The decentralized economy

We start the analysis of the decentralized case by rewriting the representative agent's optimization problem. In every period t the states At, kt, ht, and ha,t are given and next period's states kt+1 and ht+1 have to be chosen. The agent also knows the government's balanced budget restriction (36). This means that the agent's earnings generated by human and physical capital income can not exceed the economy's per capita production. Then the maximization problem is given by:

sup E0
{kt+1 ,ht+1 }t=0


tF (kt, ht, kt+1, ht+1; At, ha,t)
t=0

,

such that

F (kt, ht, kt+1, ht+1; At, ha,t) = ln

Atkt

ht

-

ht+1 B

1- ha,t - kt+1

,

0 < ht+1 < Bht, 0 < kt+1 < Atktht1-ha,t, 0 < ha,t+1 < Bha,t,
ln At+1 =  ln At + t+1,
ht = ha,t.

We have argued in Section 4 that the representative agent does not exploit the external
effect, because the market mechanism prevents agents from coordinating their actions.
However, the path of ha,t is predictable and the representative agent treats this path as given.
Let (ht, kt)  X = R+2 + and (At, ha,t)  Z = R2++ with the Borel sets X and Z.9 Let us now turn to the policy correspondence , which is given by:

 (ht, kt; At, ha,t) =

(ht+1, kt+1)

Atkt

ht

-

ht+1 B

1- ha,t - kt+1  R++;

kt+1, ht+1 > 0; ha,t = ht

for all t  0. The exogenous shocks are serially correlated with Et [ln At+1] =  ln At. Again we want to verify that Assumptions 1 and 2 hold; find (v, G) and construct the plan (·; x, z) all (x, z)  S, and show that the two hypotheses (a) and (b) of Theorem
3 hold.
First, note that Assumption 1 holds: (ht, kt; At, ha,t) is non-empty and there are lots of measurable selections, for example:

h(ht,

kt;

At,

ha,t)

=

(

1 2

Bht

,

1 2

Atktht1-ha,t)



(ht,

kt;

At,

ha,t).

In order to show that Assumption 2 holds, note first that the per-period return function
F t1-1(zt-1), t2-1(zt-1), t1(zt), t2(zt), zt is µt(z0, ·)-integrable and second that for any (xt, zt) and any   (xt, zt) for all t  N:

ln t1-1(zt-1) < t ln B + ln h0,

t-1

ln t2-1(zt-1) <

i ln At-1-i + (1 - ) ln t1-2-i(zt-2-i) +  ln ha,t-1-i + t ln k0

i=0

9Note that this Borel set differs from that in the previous section.

hold. Using the first inequality, we may further simplify the second and finally arrive at the following condition:10

Since F (ht, kt, ht+1, kt+1, At; ha,t)  F (ht, kt, 0, 0, At; ha,t) holds for the per-period return function we know that:

F t1-1(zt-1), t2-1(zt-1), t1(zt), t2(zt), zt  ln At +  ln ha,t + (1 - ) ln t1-1(zt-1) +  ln t2-1(zt-1)

(46)

must also hold. Hence for any pair (h0, k0, A0) and for any feasible plan , the sequence of expected one period returns satisfies:

E0 [F (·, t)]

ln A0 (1-)(1-)

This concludes our search for an upper bound of the value function, i.e. we have shown that the limit in Assumption 2 exists although it may be minus infinity.
We know from Section 4 that:

v(h, k, A) =  + k ln k + h ln h + ha ln ha + A ln A + B ln B

(47)

solves the functional equation. The coefficients i, with i  {k, h, ha, A, B}, were defined as follows11:

k

:=

 1-

,

h

:=

1- (1-)(1-)

,

ha

:=

 (1-)(1-)

,

B

:=

(1-+) (1- )2 (1-

)

,

A

:=

1 (1-)(1-)

.

È10Note that

by:

Indeed these coefficients imply that the function v(h, k, A) is below the upper bound. The policy functions associated with v are given by:

(48) (49)

Hence, given any initial state s0 = (k0, h0, ha,0, A0), the plan 1[·, s0] generated by the
first policy rule can be calculated explicitly. Using this plan we also can calculate the second plan 2[·, s0]; in logs, they are:

ln t1-1[·, s0]

=

t ln B + t ln

  +w (1- )

+ ln h0,

t-1

ln t2-1[·, s0] =

ln

+ ln B

It remains only to be shown that conditions (a) and (b) of Theorem 3 hold. In order to verify that the plans 1[·, s0] and 2[·, s0] satisfy condition (a), we have to show that (37) holds for all (s0) when applying 1[·, s0] and 2[·, s0], where v is given by (47). In
our case we consider:

v t1-1 At-1, hta-1 , t2-1 At-1, hat-1 , At, ha,t

=

 + B ln B + (h + ha ) t ln B + t ln

  +w (1- )

i=0 i=0

Using the fact that 0 <  < 1, 0 <  < 1, and E0 [ln At] = t ln A0, it is straightforward to show that condition (37) indeed holds12.
In order to verify condition (b) we need to show that for any initial state (s0)  S, any plan in (s0) is weakly dominated by a plan in ^ (s0). Let (s0)  S and   (s0) be arbitrary. By definition   ^ (s0) if and only if (37) holds. With v given by (47), condition (37) reads as follows:

lim
t



tE0

 + A ln At + ha ln hat + h ln t1-1[At-1,hta-1] + k ln t2-1[At-1,hat-1]

= 0,

where  :=  + B ln B. It follows from the assumptions on the At's that

lim
t



t

E0

A ln At

=

lim

0.

Furthermore, note that the path of ln ha,t is bounded by t ln B + ln ha,0. Hence condition (37) holds if and only if:

lim
t



t

E0

h ln t1-1[At-1] + k ln t2-1[At-1]

= 0.

12Note, that for   (0, 1) limt tt = 0 holds.

(50)

21

That is,   ^ (s0) if and only if condition (50) holds. In addition, we know from (38) and (39) that for all st and any   (st) for all t  N

lim
t

tE0

ln t1-1[At-1, hat-1]

0

and

lim
t

tE0

ln t2-1[At-1, hat-1]

(51)

must hold. Now suppose that  / ^ (s0), i.e. (44) fails. It follows from the inequality in (46) that



u (, h0, k0, A0)  E0

t ln At + (1 -  + ) ln t1-1[At-1] +  ln t2-1[At-1]

t=0

.

Since (44) fails, the conditions in (45) imply that this series must diverge to minus infinity: u (, h0, k0, A0) = -; in this case 1 and 2 dominate 1 and 2. Thus condition (b) is satisfied, and Theorem 3 applies. That is, v is indeed the value function and the
policy rules are given by (48) and (49).
