The (In)stability of Money Demand in the Euro Area:
Lessons from a Cross-Country Analysis
Dieter Nautz and Ulrike Rondorf 12th April 2010
Abstract
The instability of standard money demand functions has undermined the role of monetary aggregates for monetary policy analysis in the euro area. This paper uses country-specic monetary aggregates to shed more light on the economics behind the instability of euro area money demand. Our results obtained from panel estimation indicate that the observed instability of standard money demand functions could be explained by omitted variables like e.g. technological progress that are important for money demand but constant across member countries.

1 Introduction
While most economists would agree that standard money demand functions have become unstable in the euro area, the economics behind money demand instability are still under debate. On the one hand, the instability of empirical money demand functions are seen as ultimate proof of the decoupling of monetary aggregates from ination and the real economy. From this perspective, money demand instability undermines the information content and usefulness of money growth data for the ECB's monetary policy. On the other hand, empirical money demand functions might have been unstable simply because the estimated models were misspecied due to the omission of important variables.
The empirical literature has proposed several plausible candidates as additional regressors in order to reestablish money demand stability. Examples include proxies for wealth (Boone and van den Noord 2008, Beyer 2009) and macroeconomic uncertainty (Greiber and Lemke 2005, de Bondt 2009), the prices of stocks (Dreger and Wolters 2009, 2010) and their volatility (Carstensen 2006). Empirical results, however, have been mixed and the causes and consequences of money demand (in)stability are still underresearched. This paper re-investigates money demand (in)stability by estimating a euro area money demand function from cross-country data.
The empirical money demand literature is almost exclusively based on aggregated data for the whole euro area. For most applications, this is the natural choice because the common monetary policy in the euro area should depend on euro area wide aggregates and not on country-specic developments. Yet, money demand functions obtained from a panel analysis of regional data may still contain useful information. For example, Driscoll (2004) estimates the regional money demands of U.S. states to assess the relevance of the bank lending
channel.1
In the current paper, we estimate a panel money demand function of the euro area to shed more light on the causes of money demand instability. Since the panel estimation is based on national deviations from the euro area wide means, all variables that are constant across countries cancel out, including those who are probably responsible for the instability of the aggregate money demand, like technological progress, international stock market indices, consumer senti-
1Rondorf (2010) and Cappiello et al. (2010) adopt Driscoll's approach to explore the
impact of bank loans on output growth in the euro area. A further panel estimation of euro area money demand is provided by Setzer and Wol (2009).

ment etc. Put dierently, evidence in favour of stable regional money demand functions indicate that the observed instability of the aggregate money demand might be explained by some missing macro variables. In this case, stable euro area money demand functions may be obtained by augmenting money demand by those omitted variables and research directed to nd these variables is promising.
The cross-sectional approach to money demand has been introduced by Mulligan and Sala-i-Martin (1992) who estimated U.S. money demand using data from the federal states. They already emphasised that a cross-country analysis of money demand can overcome the stability problems of standard time series approaches, because omitted variables may drop out. Advancing on Mulligan and Sala-i-Martin (1992), we follow Driscoll's (2004) analysis of regional U.S. money demand by exploiting the panel structure of the data.
The following empirical analysis employs data from the founding members of the European Monetary Union (EMU) from 1999 to the second quarter of 2008. In contrast to traditional time series studies on money demand, the relatively short euro area period is not a problem for panel estimation. As a result, the analysis does not have to rely on synthetic euro area data. Our empirical results support the notion of structural stability of money demand in the euro area. In particular, we obtain reasonable estimates for the long-run (semi)elasticities of interest rates and income.
The paper is structured as follows: In Section 2 we briey review the main ndings of the literature on the European money demand. Section 3 discusses the features and problems of the cross-sectional approach to money demand estimation. Section 4 describes the data set and presents the empirical results. Finally, Section 5 oers some concluding remarks.
2 The (in)stability of European money demand
Since the start of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in 1999, the European Central Bank has repeatedly emphasised the prominent role of monetary aggregates for its monetary policy analysis. Especially in the early years of the century, inspired by the monetary targeting strategy of the German Bundesbank, the ECB tried to explain the course of monetary policy by the development of money growth. However, compared with former evidence on German money demand (Lütkepohl et al. 1999), the empirical link between money growth and

ination appeared to be less close and predictable in the euro area. Referring to the published reference value for money growth, naive forecasts of the ECB's interest rate decisions would have typically been misleading in the short-term, see Figure 1. In May 2003, the ECB responded to these communication problems by abandoning the reference value and with a clarication of its monetary policy strategy, see ECB (2003). Since then, the ECB's monetary analysis puts more emphasis on the long-term relation between monetary aggregates and ination.
The money demand function provides the predominant theoretical concept for the empirical relationship between monetary aggregates, ination, and the real economy. The (in)stability of euro area money demand functions has therefore always been an important theme in the recent debate on the role of money for monetary policy. Among others, Brand and Cassola (2004), Coenen and Vega (2001), Hayo (1999) and Funke (2001) conrmed the stability of euro area money demand. These early contributions employed standard specications of money demand and performed cointegration analysis to identity the long run relationship between real money supply, income and an interest rate variable.
Following this rst round of supportive evidence on money demand stability, several studies including Carstensen (2006) and Gerlach and Svensson (2003) fail

4

to nd a stable long-run money demand in the euro area. They conclude that money demand has become unstable implying that the informational content of monetary aggregates for monetary policy gets dubious. Carstensen (2006) provides a rst attempt to explain the observed instability. He augments the standard money demand specication by stock prices and stock market volatility to capture the massive re-allocations of liquidity observed in 2001. He shows that the sharp increase in money growth rates after 2001 can partly be explained by falling stock prices and high stock market volatility.
In the same vein, the recent literature tries to reestablish the stability of euro area money demand by including additional regressors in the money demand equation. Boone and van den Noord (2008) include stock prices and also house prices in their empirical money demand model to capture wealth eects. Greiber and Lemke (2005) investigate whether macroeconomic uncertainty can explain the portfolio shifts that lead to high money growth in the past decade. By incorporating nancial markets characteristics and economic sentiment indicators in a money demand equation, they are able to explain the movements of M3, at least until 2004. For a similar sample period, Dreger and Wolters (2010) suggest that the apparent instability of money demand can be explained by the strong movements in the stock markets. After 2004, however, economic sentiment indicators increased and nancial markets recovered, but the growth rates of M3 even increased further.
Even 10 years after the introduction of the euro, the empirical literature on euro area money demand has to rely on synthetic euro area data where national data starting from the early eighties have been converted into a single synthetic currency. As a consequence, the resulting data and, thus, the money demand estimates, crucially depend on the choice of the exchange rate. In the literature, current exchange rates, xed rates of a base period as well as the
PPP exchange rates have been applied.2 Moreover, the time series approach
to euro area money demand implicitly assumes a common European monetary policy even for the pre-euro period. In view of these problems, it is a further advantage of a cross-country panel approach to euro area money demand that estimates can be based completely on data from the euro area.
2Beyer et al. (2001) discuss the alternative ways to construct synthetic euro area data.

3 Money demand from a cross-sectional perspective
The cross-sectional approach to money demand has been introduced by Mulligan and Sala-i-Martin (1992). They estimate the US money demand year by year using cross-sectional data from the individual states. Following Mulligan and Sala-i-Martin (1992), cross-sectional estimation of money demand avoids many problems of the standard time series approach. In particular, structural breaks over time or instability of money demand due to time-varying coecients can only be an issue in a time series analysis.
More importantly, a cross-sectional money demand function can reveal information about the sources of money demand instability. From a purely time series perspective, the omission of relevant variables can lead to biased and presumably unstable estimates of in fact stable money demand functions. By contrast, crosssectional money demand estimations are unaltered by the omission of variables provided that those are constant across units. Since cross-section estimation is based on deviations from cross-sectional means those (probably omitted) variables simply drop out. Mulligan and Sala-i-Martin (1992) view the variable "technological process" as a typical example for a variable that aects US money demand but is constant across states.
While a pure cross-sectional analysis might be feasible for 50 US federal states, the number of euro area member countries is relatively small. Following Driscoll (2004), we therefore augment the cross-sectional perspective by the time dimension and shall estimate a euro area money demand using panel econometrics. Estimating a cross-sectional or panel money demand function does not only require the availability of regional data, see Section 4.1. For the US, the cross-sectional approach to money demand is feasible because federal states are (i) highly decentralised but (ii) still within a federal system having a common monetary policy.
Both assumptions also apply to the member countries of the euro area. In fact, the cross-sectional approach to money demand might work even better in the euro area than in the US. Firstly, in the euro area distortionary cross-border holdings are of minor importance. For Europeans, it is far less common to have an account in another Euro area country than it is for an US citizen to have an
account in a dierent federal state.3 3If a European household invests money abroad, it will mainly be for portfolio reasons. On
average cross-border holdings from other EMU members account for only 8% of deposits of
6

Secondly, in the US regional monetary aggregates are problematic because the states New York and Illinois (Chicago) are dominant nancial centres that attract a lot of money from other states. By contrast, the role of nancial centres, like Frankfurt, is comparably week in the euro area. In fact, the main European nancial centre is London which is outside the euro area. Luxembourg is the only euro area country where the nancial sector accounts for a very high fraction of the gross domestic product. As a result, the inclusion of Luxembourg could be a problem for the estimation of a cross-country euro area money demand. However, in the following empirical analysis, this country cannot be considered anyway because national monetary aggregates are not available for Luxembourg.
Finally, the use of cross-country data may ameliorate the critical issue of money supply endogeneity. Endogeneity might be of particular importance for the euro area where monetary aggregates play a role for the communication and the conduct of monetary policy. Suppose, for example, that a money supply shock leads to an increase in the interest rate governed by the central bank. If higher interest rates imply lower income, then the resulting correlation between money supply shocks and income will bias the estimated money demand coefcients. Therefore, as long as euro area wide monetary policy does not react to country-specic shocks, cross-sectional estimation mitigates the endogeneity problem of aggregate money supply.
4 A panel estimation of euro area money demand
4.1 Data
4.1.1 Monetary aggregates
Our panel analysis of euro area money demand employs quarterly data from all founding members of the European monetary union (EMU) including Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Finland and
the Netherlands.4 We use quarterly data from the start of EMU in 1999 until
the second quarter of 2008 which gives us 10 × 38 = 380 observations.
In accordance with Mulligan and Sala-i-Martin's (1992) and Driscoll's (2004)
non-monetary nancial institutions, see ECB bank balance sheet statistics. Note that crossborder holdings tend to be higher in smaller countries. Thus, cross-border holdings are more important in the US partly because the cross-sectional units (the states) are relatively small.
4The only exception is Luxembourg which is not included because of data availability.

analysis of US money demand, we use country-specic monetary aggregates supplied by the national central banks. In the euro area, these country-specic monetary aggregates can be interpreted as the national contribution to the euro zone-wide aggregate. Currency is excluded in these series as it cannot be unambiguously assigned to a specic country. Following the empirical money demand literature, we focus on the demand for M3. Figure 2 displays M3 for the euro area as a whole and the sum of the national contributions over all euro area countries under consideration. Conrming the reliability of the country-specic monetary aggregates, the dierences between the two series is small and mainly
due to the entry of further countries to the euro area.5 The average annual
growth rate of M3 less currency amounts to 7.2% from 1999 to 2008.

Notes: The line labelled ECB data shows the growth rates of the monetary aggregate M3 minus currency for all current member countries as published by the ECB. Aggregated data denotes growth rates of M3 derived from the sum of the national M3 contributions of the ten countries under considerations.

While Mulligan and Sala-i-Martin (1992) assume that the price level is the same in all US states, we obtain real money supply referring to country-specic GDP deators. The seasonally adjusted series of country-specic GDP and its deator are obtained from Eurostat.

4.1.2 Interest rates
The cross-sectional approach to money demand is based on cross-sectionally demeaned variables. Therefore, a variable can only be used in a panel estimation of euro area money demand if it diers across countries. This requirement has important implications for the choice of the interest rate variable in the money demand function. In particular, short-term money market rates are not feasible in our application because the degree of integration of euro area interbank money markets is extremely high. As a consequence the Euribor replaced the national interest rates as a reference rate after 1999 in the three month segment of the money market. In order to account for both, the opportunity costs for holding money and the own rate of money, we consider two dierent sets of countryspecic interest rates.
In contrast to interbank rates, the interest rate on the deposits of nonnancial corporations have converged but constraints are still in place, see the nancial integration report by the ECB (2008). From 2003 onwards, national deposit rates for deposits with a maturity up to one year are published monthly in the ECB-statistics, see Section interest rates by monetary nancial institutions . Before 2003, the series are obtained directly from the national central banks. Due to the maturity mismatch between the (up to) one year deposit rate and M3 which contains deposits up to only three month, the available deposit rates are not a perfect measure for the own rate of money. Driscoll (2004), for example, estimates a negative relationship between deposit rates and US money demand implying that deposit rates capture the opportunity cost of money rather than the own rate of interest.
According to the empirical money demand literature, a natural choice for a variable measuring the opportunity cost of money is the interest rate for longterm government bonds. Country-specic spreads between long-term interest rates are driven by the indebtedness and the economic situation in that country. In the current nancial crisis, spreads have increased dramatically for some euroarea countries. In our sample, cross-country deviations from the average euro area bond rate were typically about eight basis points, compare Figure 3.
We tested the stationarity of our data using the panel unit root test introduced by Pesaran (2007) that allows for cross-sectional dependence. The results clearly indicate that the levels of all variables, including real money supply, income, and both interest rates under consideration, follow I(1)-processes, see Table 4 in the Appendix.

4.2 The benchmark specication for euro area money demand
In accordance with Driscoll (2004), our empirical analysis is based on the following standard specication for the long-run money demand,

m~ it - p~it = 1y~it + 2r~it

(1)

where real money demand depends on income and an interest rate variable.

In the panel estimation, all variables are demeaned from their cross-sectional

average, i.e. x~it = xit - (1/N)

and

are

(except for the interest rates). In order to account for short-run dynamics of

money demand, we follow e.g. Pesaran and Shin (1999) and estimate the long-

run income and interest rate elasticities in an error correction framework,

where di denotes a country-specic xed eect and the long-run (semi)elasticities are obtained as 1 = -1/ and 2 = -2/, respectively. Similar to an esti-

mation of an aggregate euro area money demand based on a purely time-series

perspective, our benchmark specication assumes in a rst step that the short-

run dynamics are the same across countries. Applying standard information
criteria, we choose the lag orders p and q equal to two.

Table 1 presents the estimation results for the benchmark specication of

euro area money demand using three dierent interest rate variables for measu-

ring the opportunity cost of money. In the three columns of the table we show

the estimates obtained for long-term government bond yields (r lit), the interest

and

their

(r

The

results

suggests two main conclusions. First, for all interest rate measures under consi-

deration the estimated long-run income elasticity of euro area money demand

is highly signicant and plausibly signed. In line with earlier contributions on

euro area money demand based on a pure time series approach, the panel es-

timates of income elasticities are clearly above one, ranging from 1.41 to 1.55.

Therefore, the cross-country analysis of money demand supports the evidence

of a declining income velocity in the euro area.

Second, as expected, the results obtained for the long-run interest rate

(semi)elasticity strongly depends on the interest rate measure applied. In line

with the interpretation of an opportunity cost variable, one obtains a negatively

signed estimate for the long-term interest rate and the interest rate spread. In

contrast, the positive coecient of the deposit rate indicates that this interest

rate is more closely related to the concept of the own rate of money. However,
the long-run interest rate eect is only signicant in case of r~it = r ilt. Moreover,
panel cointegration tests show that the inclusion of the long-term interest rate

is required to obtain a cointegrated long-run money demand function for the

euro area. This shows that the long-term interest rate is the most appropriate

interest measure in our application. In the following, we therefore investigate

the robustness of the results focusing on money demand functions incorporating

the long-term interest rate.

4.3 Sensitivity Analysis
4.3.1 Heterogeneous short-run dynamics: Pooled mean group estimation
Following e.g. Driscoll (2004) and Mulligan and Sala-i-Martin (1992), the benchmark specication presented in Table 1 assumed that money demand coecients are homogeneous across euro area countries. This restriction may be particular severe for the short-run dynamics of a money demand function. In order to check the robustness of our results, we therefore re-estimate the euro area money demand function applying the pooled mean group estimation (PMGE) introduced by Pesaran, Shin and Smith (1999). In this model the short-run dynamics are allowed to dier between countries but the long-run relationships are restricted to be homogeneous. Advancing on our benchmark specication, the pooled mean group estimation is based on a ARDL-model with heterogeneous short-run dynamics:

(m~ it - p~it) = i (m~ it-1 - p~it-1) + 1y~it + 2r~ it+

(3)

We nd that the standard Hausman test rejects the null hypothesis of homogeneous short run dynamics at the 5% but not at the 1% signicance level. Therefore, it is not obvious that assuming heterogeneous short-run dynamics is actually helpful and that PMGE should be the preferred estimation technique. However, according to the results shown in Table 2, the main results obtained for the euro area money demand are not aected by the assumptions about short-run dynamics. The PMGE estimates for both, the long-run income and the interest rate (semi)elasticity are highly signicant, plausibly signed and similar to those obtained for the benchmark specication.

4.3.2 The role of wealth
Let us now investigate whether our results are also robust with respect to the inclusion of additional variables. According to the literature, wealth is the most critical factor that may have additional eects on long-run money demand. In particular, as Mankiw (1992) already emphasised, income elasticities higher

The interest rate measure is the long-term interest rate. The panel cointegration test rejects the null of "no cointegration" at the 1% level, compare Westerlund (2005). See Table 1 for further explanation.

than one could be explained by the omission of wealth in the estimated money demand function. Since both income and wealth increase the total volume of liquid assets that a household can possibly hold, wealth might be a relevant gure in portfolio decisions. Note, however, that it is not indisputable that the eect of wealth on the demand for money is positive, see Boone and van den Noord (2008). A rise in wealth can also cause a decline in money demand due to a substitution eect that is opposed by the positive income eect of wealth. If, for instance, equity prices go up, the households will probably move money into stock markets as the cost of the availability of liquid assets increase. This eect could be observed in the current nancial crisis. Conditional on the slump in all asset prices at the peak of the downturn, the attractiveness of money compared to other investment rose.
In according with the recent literature, we re-estimated the benchmark specication for euro area money demand by including two dierent wealth measures. The rst proxy of wealth refers to equity prices. Specically, we employ the leading national stock price index of the euro area countries under consideration, as indicated by Bloomberg. From a cross-country perspective, the role of wealth can only be assessed if it varies across countries. In fact, there have been notable cross-country variations in stock prices in the euro area, particularly during the

rst years of the monetary union, see Figure 5. The second variable measuring wealth refers to house prices where country-specic dierences are even more pronounced. For example, while Spain and the Ireland have experienced a massive housing boom, house prices in Germany and Austria more or less stagnated, see Figure 4. In the following, we use the house price indexes published by the ECB and the German Bundesbank as proxies for the house prices in the 10
countries.6
The results obtained for the wealth-augmented money demand functions are shown in Table 3. Apparently, none of our conclusions based on the benchmark specication of euro area money demand is distorted by wealth eects. In spite of the notable cross-country variations in both proxies for wealth, neither equity nor house prices aect the cross-sectional long-run money demand in a signicant way. The only signicant coecient refers to the lagged rst dierence of the cross-country deviation in stock prices. Overall, wealth does not seem to be a mayor determinant of the movements in the cross-country deviations of euro area money demand.
5 Concluding remarks
The (in)stability of the euro area money demand function plays a central role for the importance of money for the monetary policy of the European Central Bank. The current paper investigated the determinants of euro area money demand from a cross-country perspective. To that aim, we employed country-specic data including the national contributions to the euro-area wide monetary aggregates collected from the national central banks. In contrast to the partly mixed results of the empirical literature using aggregated time series data, panel cointegration tests provided evidence in favour of a stable long-run money demand function. In particular, irrespective from the interest rate measure, the estimation procedure, and the inclusion of wealth in the empirical money demand model, the estimated long-run income elasticity of money demand is clearly above one. This strongly conrms earlier evidence on the declining income velocity of money demand in the euro area.
The distinguishing feature of a cross-country perspective on money demand is that shocks like technological innovations or turmoils of nancial markets that

hit all countries equally cannot distort estimation results because the estimation is based exclusively on deviations from cross-country averages. A stable crosscountry money demand for the euro area thus indicates that the instability of standard euro area money demand functions could be explained by omitted macro variables. This nding has two important consequences. First, recent research directed to nd these omitted macro variables is promising, compare de Bondt (2009). And, second, our results support the renewed interest in the development of monetary aggregates stirred by the recent nancial crisis.
