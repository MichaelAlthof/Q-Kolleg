The optimal industry structure in a vertically related market
Ra§aele Fiocco
April 19, 2010
Abstract We consider a vertically related market characterized by downstream imperfect competition and by the monopolistic provision of an essential facility-based input, whose price is set by a social-welfare maximizing regulator. Our model shows that the regulatory knowledge about the cost for providing the monopolistic input crucially affects the design of the optimal industry structure. In particular, we compare ownership separation, which prevents a single company from having the control of both upstream and downstream operations, and legal separation, under which these activities are legally unbundled but common ownership is allowed. As long as the regulator has full information, the two industry patterns yield the same social welfare level. However, under asymmetric information about the input costs legal separation can make the whole society better o§. Keywords: access charge, legal separation, ownership separation, regulation.

1. Introduction
The large-scale liberalization process occurred over last decades has a§ected many sectors where naturally monopolistic and potentially competitive activities are vertically related. This is often the case, for instance, in network industries, like the electricity, natural gas, railways and water utilities. The supply of the service to ...nal consumers, which admits competition at least to some extent, requires the use of an essential facility-based input - the network - provided by a monopolistic ...rm.
One of the most interesting issues in policy debates is how to design the industry structure following the liberalization process. In practice, this question has received di§erent answers. The Electricity Act of 1989 divided the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) of England and Wales, which operated as a vertically integrated statutory monopoly, in four public limited companies and transmission grid activities were separated from generation. The same approach was followed in USA, where, after some important legislative measures, the Order 888 issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in 1996 mandated that owners of regional transmission networks act as common carriers of electric power. Rather than having one vertically integrated provider of electricity, retail customers can now access the wholesale power market directly and purchase unbundled distribution and transmission services from their local utility to deliver power.
On the contrary, in 1984 British Telecommunications (BT) was privatized as a vertically integrated monopoly and only in 1995 there was the accounting separation of its operations into network and retail businesses. Also the privatization of British Gas (BG) in 1986 occurred without restructuring. Even though the government did not follow the 1993 Monopolies and Mergers Commission's recommendation for breaking up the company, now BG provides its pipeline services through a separate unit.1
More recently, the European Union has focused on the design of market structure in network industries. The European directives 2009/72/EC and 2009/73/EC,2 which concern common rules for the internal market in electricity and natural gas respectively, provide that a transmission system owner, which is part of a vertically integrated undertaking, must be inde-

pendent at least in terms of its legal form, organization and decision-making from other activities not relating to transmission. These rules do not create an obligation to separate the ownership of assets of the transmission system from the other activities, even though the European Commission had strongly recommended the actual separation of production from network services.
This discussion emphasizes that we can identify two main approaches to the problem of designing the industry structure in markets where regulated and competitive activities are vertically related. The ...rst one, which prohibits the upstream regulated monopolist from participating (directly or indirectly) in the downstream competitive segment, is known as ownership separation. The alternative solution, according to which upstream and downstream operations must be legally unbundled but common ownership is allowed, is de...ned as legal separation. As Vickers points out, <<despite its importance for policy, the question of whether a regulated monopolist should be allowed also to operate in a vertically related industry has received relatively little theoretical attention>> [12, p. 16].
This paper aims at giving a contribution to the debate about the choice of the type of unbundling to implement in vertically related markets and advancing some policy suggestions.3
The topic is so broad and complex that it cannot be treated in an exhaustive way. We want to address only some relevant aspects of the problem at hand. Vogelgang [14] stresses that asymmetric information between regulators and regulated ...rms, despite its importance for the access pricing in network industries, has so far played a minor role in the policy debate. Armstrong and Sappington also have recently recognized that <<further research is warranted on the design of regulatory policy in vertically-integrated industries when regulators are less omniscient>> [4, p. 1684].
We intend to investigate how the presence of limited regulatory knowledge about the cost for providing an upstream facility-based input can a§ect the optimal industry structure,4 when the regulator is charged with determining the input access price paid by downstream competitive ...rms.
3 We recognize that a way to organize such an industry is to have one vertically integrated monopolist and to regulate the ...nal product price. However, we assume that policy makers want to promote liberalization in potentially competitive segments, consistently with the practical examples quoted above.
4 Armstrong and Sappington [3] emphasize that there are other important issues that should be take into account when the potential bene...ts of legal and ownership separation are assessed, like their di§erent impact on the economies of scope or the quality of the upstream input. The evaluation of these aspects is outside the scope of this paper.
3

In other terms, we want to answer the following question. When the input access price is regulated in a situation of asymmetric cost information, is it better to have legal separation or to require ownership unbundling between upstream and downstream operations?
Economic literature has recognized that one of the most important bene...ts from a policy of ownership separation is the prevention of anticompetitive practices in the unregulated market. When it operates (directly or indirectly) in the retail market, the input monopolist will generally anticipate greater pro...ts from its downstream activities as the costs of its rivals increase. If the regulator is uncertain about the cost for supplying the input, the monopolist will seek to rise the costs of its downstream competitors by exaggerating its input cost. Vickers [12] shows analytically that vertical integration can complicate the regulator's critical control problem, since it increases the monopolist's incentives to overstate the access costs.
In this paper we consider a vertically related industry in which two ...rms - an incumbent and an entrant - compete in the downstream market. This is of course a shortcut since in reality imperfect competition takes forms which are much more complex. However, we believe that such an assumption is able to capture in a simple way two main aspects that characterize downstream sectors in many network industries. The ...rst feature is the presence of a limited number of ...rms which can make positive pro...ts.5 The second element is the existence of a dominant ...rm (typically monopolist before liberalization) and one or more weaker competitors which have recently entered the market.
The upstream essential input is provided by a monopoly. It is important to stress that under either industry pattern this is the only ...rm which is subject to price regulation.6 Under legal separation, the downstream incumbent and the upstream monopolist belong to the same company, even though they are independent in terms of their legal form.7 On the contrary, ownership separation implies a stronger pattern of unbundling since the two
5 Vickers [12] considers a setting where the number of downstream ...rms is determined endogenously by free entry, which implies zero pro...ts. He shows that deregulation of the downstream sector may lead to excessive entry and duplication of the ...xed costs.
6 In Vickers's [12] model, also the monopolist's pro...ts arising from the downstream competitive activity are constrained by regulatory arrangements. However, as Vickers himself recognizes, regulatory bodies in the UK and elsewhere generally control only the monopolistic activities and allow the ...rm independently to operate in the deregulated sector, without a§ecting the outcome of competition there.
7 Empirical evidence shows that in most cases the company which runs the infrastructure segment is actually dominant also in the downstream sector when it is allowed to operate there.

undertakings cannot be subject to the same control. In such a setting, our model shows that the two industry regimes yield the
same social welfare level as long as the regulator is fully informed about the input costs. However, we ...nd that the presence of asymmetric information can make it more desirable to implement legal separation. The idea is that the upstream monopolist's greater pro...t from exaggerating input costs can be (at least in part) o§set by the losses of the downstream branch which pays a higher access price. Consequently, a trade-o§ occurs between the incentive to overstate the input costs and the incentive to understate. This relaxes the regulator's critical control problem and increases (expected) social welfare.
The policy implication of our model is that ownership separation should not be thought of as the best solution to mitigate the upstream monopolist's incentive to overstate its costs. Indeed, we ...nd that legal separation creates countervailing incentives within the vertical group that the regulator can exploit to make the society better o§.
The plan of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we describe the basic structures of the model. Section 3 compares the outcomes under legal and ownership unbundling in the benchmark case of complete information. In Section 4 we study how the presence of asymmetric information can affect the choice between the two regimes. This enables us to draw policy recommendations. Section 5 is devoted to some concluding remarks.

2. Basic structures
We examine a vertically related industry which supplies a single homogeneous ...nal product, whose inverse demand function is given by

p (Q) =

Q,

(2.1)

where Q denotes total quantity in the downstream market and ; > 0 are parameters.
The consumers'surplus from purchasing Q units of output is then

1 CS (Q) =

Q2.

2

(2.2)

The downstream market is characterized by an incumbent ...rm and an

entrant, whose pro...ts are respectively equal to

I (qI ; Q; a) = [p (Q) c a] qI and

(2.3)

5

E (qE; Q; a) = [p (Q) c a] qE,

(2.4)

where Q qI + qE. Expressions (2.3) and (2.4) show that the per-unit pro...t of each ...rm is given by the di§erence between the net revenue from the marketplace (p c) and the cost a incurred to purchase the access service. The level of downstream marginal costs c is constant and common to both producers.8
Notice that both ...rms incur a payment a per unit of input to the upstream monopolist. What we are implicitly assuming is that they cannot bypass the monopolist's access service, so that exactly one unit of upstream input is needed for each unit of the ...nal product.9
The upstream regulated monopolist, which provides the access to a crucial input (the network), has a pro...t equal to

N (Q; a; S) = (a cu) Q + S,

(2.5)

which is the sum of the net gain received from the two downstream ...rms plus a subsidy S ? 0. The supply of the upstream service implies a constant marginal cost cu.10
Under legal unbundling, the downstream incumbent and the upstream monopolist are separate only in legal terms. In fact, they constitue a single vertical group, whose aggregate pro...t from (2.3) and (2.5) is given by

V (qI ; qE; a; S) I + N = [p (Q) c cu] qI + (a cu) qE + S. (2.6)
We assume that the access price a and the subsidy S are set by a benevolent regulator, which is charged with maximizing social welfare W , de...ned as the sum of the consumers'surplus, the downstream ...rms'pro...ts and the upstream monopolist's pro...ts minus the subsidy S. Formally, we have

W CS + I + E + N S,

(2.7)

8 This is clearly a simpli...cation as ...rms are likely to have di§erent costs. However, such
an assumption should not undermine our results in terms of social welfare comparison. 9 When downstream ...rms have some ability to substitute away from the monopolist's
input, their constant marginal cost ' (a) for producing a unit of their own retail service is no longer equal to a + c [which implies 00 (a) = 0] but it is a concave function of a
00
[ (a) < 0]. 10 We can imagine that there are ...xed costs upstream which make the activity naturally
monopolistic. However, these costs are not excessively large in relation to consumers'
valuation of the product, so that they do not play no role in the analysis and can be
ignored.

6

where 2 [0; 1] is a weight on monopoly earnings, which reects the regulator's distributional concern in favour of consumers and ...rms which operate in the competitive market. It is important to stress that under legal separation the agency still regulates only the upstream ...rm, since it represents the legal entity charged with monopoly operations, while downstream activities occur in a liberalized market. Notice also that the downstream ...rms count as consumers for social welfare. The idea is that the regulator ...nds it so important to have competition as to give the pro...ts of the downstream ...rms the same weight as consumers'surplus.
Our regulatory model can be represented as a sequential game. At the ...rst stage, the regulator makes a take-it-or-leave-it o§er of a regulatory mechanism fa; Sg, which the upstream monopolist can either accept or reject. If the ...rm refuses the proposed policy the regulatory interaction ends. In case of acceptance, at the second stage the downstream incumbent determines its production and at the last stage another ...rm decides to enter the market.

3. Complete information
To study in a suitable way the impact of the regulatory knowledge about the input costs on the choice between legal and ownership separation, we ...rst derive the regulatory outcomes under both regimes in the benchmark case of complete information.

3.1. Legal separation
Applying the backward induction procedure, we start by deriving the entrant's strategy at the last stage. Substituting (2.1) into (2.4), we can write down the entrant's maximization problem as follows

max (
qE

qE qI c a) qE.

(3.1.1)

The ...rst-order condition for qE immediately yields the entrant's best reply function

1 qE (qI ; a) = 2 (

qI c a) .

(3.1.2)

Using (2.6) and (3.1.2), the maximization problem of the vertical group at the second stage is

7

max
qI

qI c a 2

qI c cu qI +

+ 1 (a cu) ( 2

qI c a) + S.

From (3.1.3) the ...rst-order condition for qI can be written as

(3.1.3)

1 qI + 2 (

c cu) = 0.

(3.1.4)

Solving (3.1.4) for qI yields the downstream output produced by the vertical group

qILS

=

1 2

(

c cu) ,

(3.1.5)

where c cu 0, which is the di§erence between the consumers' maximum willingness to pay and the total (marginal) costs (c + cu), can

be interpreted as the whole market size. Not surprisingly, the quantity

supplied by the vertical group does not depend on the access charge a,

which represents a mere internal transfer for the entire group.

If we replace (3.1.5) into (3.1.2) we obtain

1 qE (a) = 4 (

c + cu 2a) .

(3.1.6)

It is immediate to see from (3.1.6) that entrant's quantity decreases with a, since the input price represents a cost for the ...rm.
At the ...rst stage, the regulator has to determine the access price a and the transfer S in order to maximize social welfare, as de...ned by (2.7). Using (2.2), (2.3), (2.4), (2.5) and substituting (3.1.5) and (3.1.6) into (2.7) yields after some manipulations

where (PCC), (PCE), (PCI ) and (PCN ) are nonnegative utility constraints which guarantee the participation in the market of the consumers, the entrant, and the downstream and upstream branches of the vertical group, respectively. Notice that both parts of the aggregate ...rm are assumed to receive a nonnegative pro...t, since they are independent in terms of their legal form.
We can replace the policy instrument S with N , since from (2.5) there is a bijective correspondence between the two variables for a given a. Ignoring all the participation constraints but (PCN ),11 the regulator's maximization program in (3.1.7) becomes

3 max a; N 2

3c cu 2a + (a cu) 3 4

s:t: (P CN ).

Notice that the objective function in (3.1.8) is decreasing in N , so the

regulator ...nds it optimal to give zero pro...ts to the branch of the vertical

group which provides the essential input (

LS N

=

0).

Standard calculations show that the ...rst-order condition for a is given

by

1 (3 8

3c cu 2a) 1 (3 8

3c cu 2a) +

1 ( c + cu 2a) + 1 (3 3c cu 2a) 1 (a cu) = 0. (3.1.9)

2

From (3.1.9) we can derive the complete-information optimal access charge under legal separation, which may be written after some manipulations as

aLS = cu

1 (

c cu) .

11 It can be easily seen that they are all satis...ed in equilibrium.

(3.1.10)

9

It is immediate to see from (3.1.10) that in equilibrium the input price aLS is below its marginal cost cu. In other terms, the regulator ...nds it
optimal to subsidize the input access. As we will see, the access pricing policy
below costs is designed to o§set the potential distortion of the (unregulated) downstream price arising from the presence of imperfect competition.12
Substituting (3.1.10) into (3.1.6) yields the quantity supplied by the
entrant

qELS

=

1 2

(

c cu) .

(3.1.11)

Notice from (3.1.11) and (3.1.5) that in equilibrium the entrant and the

vertical group will produce the same quantity in the downstream market.

The subsidization of the access charge de...nitely bene...ts the entrant, which

can increase its production and o§set its strategic disadvantage with respect

to the rival.

Substituting (3.1.5) and (3.1.11) into (2.1) we ...nd that ...nal consumers

pay a price equal to

pLS = c + cu,

(3.1.12)

so that the marginal cost pricing is implemented. Even if it cannot

intervene directly in the liberalized downstream sector, the regulator charges

an input price below costs which eliminates any allocative ine¢ ciency arising

from imperfect competition.

If we replace (3.1.11) and (3.1.5) into (2.4) and (2.6) respectively and

recall that

LS N

=

0,

we

get

LS E

=

LS I

=

LS V

=

1 4

(

c cu)2 .

(3.1.13)

12 This access pricing policy can be implemented as long as transfers to the monopolist are feasible. Armstrong and Sappington [3] warn against the use of this sort of subsidies in the long-run, because they introduce at least two important problems. First, subsidized access to infrastructure can distort the technological choices of the competitor if the latter decides to use the existing network even though it would employ fewer social resources by building and running its own infrastructure. This issue refers to the provision to the entrant of the right make-or-buy incentives. Second, subsidies may permit an ine¢ cient ...rm to operate pro...tably in the market, thereby increasing industry costs and reducing social welfare. Indeed, following the e¢ cient component pricing rule (ECPR) - of which Armstrong, Doyle and Vickers [1] give a brilliant synthesis - the access price which prevents ine¢ cient entry should be equal in our setting to aLESCP R = cu, that is the di§erence between the direct cost of proving access (cu) minus the opportunity cost of proving access (p c cu = 0, since p = c + cu, as we will see below). However, neither the possibly ine¢ cient by-pass nor the threat of ine¢ cient entry are considered in our model.

10

The two downstream ...rms earn the same pro...t in equilibrium. This is a straightforward consequence of the even division of the market between them and of the unpro...tability of monopoly regulated operations for the vertical group.
Using (2.2), the consumers'surplus amounts to

CSLS = 1 ( 2

c cu)2 ,

(3.1.14)

which is increasing in the market size. From (2.5) the subsidy received by the monopolist is given by

SLS = 1 ( 2

c cu)2 .

(3.1.15)

Notice that (3.1.15) is equal to the sum of the pro...ts in (3.1.13) of the two downstream ...rms. Hence, the transfer to the upstream monopolist indirectly ...nances the pro...ts of its branch in the competitive market and those of its rival.
Using (3.1.13), (3.1.14) and (3.1.15), we can compute the completeinformation social welfare under legal separation

W LS = 1 ( 2

c cu)2 .

(3.1.16)

It appears from (3.1.16) and (3.1.14) that social welfare is equal to the consumers'surplus.

3.2. Ownership separation
To solve the regulatory game under ownership separation we adopt again the backward induction procedure. While (3.1.2) at the last stage still holds, the second-stage maximization problem of the incumbent in the downstream market must be reformulated, since the leader is now a separate ...rm which is independent from the upstream monopolist even in terms of ownership. Using (2.3) and (3.1.2), the incumbent's maximization program becomes

max
qI

qI c a 2

qI c a qI .

(3.2.1)

From (3.2.1) the ...rst-order condition for qI is given by

1 qI + 2 (

c a) = 0.

(3.2.2)

11

Using (3.2.2) we get

1 qI (a) = 2 (

c a) .

(3.2.3)

Notice from (3.2.3) that now the incumbent also incurs the essential input cost to produce its quantity. Substituting (3.2.3) into (3.1.2) yields

1 qE (a) = 4 (

c a) .

(3.2.4)

At the ...rst stage, using (3.2.3) and (3.2.4) the regulator's maximization problem of social welfare in (2.7) may be rewritten after some computations as

3 ( c a) 2

Since the objective function in (3.2.6) is decreasing in N , the regulator

0).

4

(3.2.7)

After some manipulations, the complete-information access charge under ownership separation can be written as

aOS = cu

1 (

3

c cu) .

(3.2.8)

We can immediately see from (3.2.8) that even under ownership un-

bundling the input price is below its costs in equilibrium. A comparison between (3.2.8) and (3.1.10) reveals that aLS < aOS and so the price dis-

tortion below marginal costs is higher under legal separation. To reach

its objective of minimization of allocative ine¢ ciency in the downstream

market, the regulator ...nds it optimal to subsidize access more when the

downstream imperfect competition is further undermined by the (indirect)

participation of the monopolist in the retail market. This is because in such

a case only the quantity in (3.1.6) produced by the entrant depends on the

regulated input price, while under ownership separation the regulator can

(indirectly) a§ect the outputs in (3.2.3) and (3.2.4) of both ...rms and then

the need for subsidizing the access service is lower.

Substituting (3.2.8) into (3.2.3) and (3.2.4) we ...nd the quantities sup-

plied by the incumbent and the entrant, which are respectively given by

qIOS

=

2 3

(

c cu)

and

(3.2.9)

qEOS

=

1 3

(

c cu) .

(3.2.10)

Notice that under ownership unbundling the dominant ...rm produces more than the entrant in the downstream sector, since now both ...rms bene...t from access subsidization and the incumbent can fully exploit its dominant position in the market. Consequently, as emerges from the comparison of (3.2.9) and (3.2.10) with (3.1.5) and (3.1.11) respectively, in equilibrium the independent incumbent supplies a higher quantity than the vertical group (qIOS > qILS), while the entrant proportionally reduces its sales (qEOS < qELS).
Substituting (3.2.9) and (3.2.10) into (2.1) we ...nd the downstream market price, which is equal to

pOS = pLS = c + cu.

(3.2.11)

13

Expression (3.2.11) shows that the marginal cost pricing applies under both regimes. This means that the total production is unchanged and the industry pattern only a§ects the allocation of the output between the two ...rms in equilibrium.
Using (2.3) and (2.4), the pro...ts of the incumbent and the entrant are respectively equal to

OS I

=

2 9

(

c cu)2

(3.2.12)

and

OS E

=

1 9

(

c cu)2 .

(3.2.13)

Consistently with the results in (3.2.9) and (3.2.10), ownership separation allows the incumbent to earn more than the entrant, even if both ...rms bear a reduction in their pro...ts relative to the case of legal unbundling [compare (3.2.12) and (3.2.13) with (3.1.13)]. The rationale is that now the higher input cost erodes the ...rms' pro...t margin, while the ...nal price is unchanged.
The consumers'surplus is equal to

CSOS = 1 ( 2

c cu)2 .

(3.2.14)

After a quick look at (3.2.14) and (3.1.14) we get the following result.

Lemma 1 When the regulator has full information about a vertically related market, the legal and ownership unbundling between the upstream monopolist and the downstream incumbent yield the same consumers' surplus.

The result in Lemma 1 is a straightforward consequence of (3.2.11).

If we use (2.5) and recall that

OS N

=

0,

the

transfer

to

the

monopolist

amounts to

SOS = 1 ( 3

c cu)2 .

(3.2.15)

Notice that (3.2.15) is equal to the sum of (3.2.12) and (3.2.13). Also the subsidy under ownership separation - which is lower than that under legal separation in (3.1.15) - just matches the pro...ts of the two downstream ...rms.

14

Using (3.2.12), (3.2.13), (3.2.14) and (3.2.15), we can now compute the complete-information social welfare under ownership unbundling

W OS = 1 ( 2

c cu)2 .

(3.2.16)

If we compare (3.2.16) and (3.1.16), we ...nd the following result.

Lemma 2 When the regulator has full information about a vertically related market, the legal and ownership unbundling between the upstream monopolist and the downstream incumbent yield the same social welfare level.

The result in Lemma 2 indicates that a fully-informed regulator is able to replicate the same social-welfare outcome under both regimes by implementing a di§erent allocation of the total output between the downstream ...rms through the regulation of access charge. As we will see, this conclusion no longer holds when the monopolist can use strategically its private information about the input costs.

4. Asymmetric cost information
The observations emphasized in Lemmas 1 and 2 have been derived under the condition that the regulator is fully informed. As Baron and Myerson argue, <<this assumption is unlikely to be met in reality, since the ...rm would be expected to have better information than would the regulator>> [6, p. 911].
We suppose now that there is asymmetric information about the upstream marginal costs cu.14 The revelation principle ensures that, without any loss of generality, the regulator may be restricted to direct incentive compatible policies, which require the ...rm to report its cost parameter and which give the ...rm no incentive to lie.15 The regulatory problem can be reduced to the design of a mechanism M = a (bcu) ; S (bcu) ; bcu 2 cu ; c+u , which determines the access charge a (:) and the subsidy S (:) to the ...rm as functions of its report bcu 2 cu ; cu+ , by inducing the ...rm to reveal honestly its private information, so that in equilibrium bcu = cu. The regulator is supposed to have only imperfect prior knowledge about cu, represented

4.1. Legal separation

We know that the regime of legal unbundling implies that the upstream

monopolist and the downstream incumbent form a vertical group which

acts as a single entity, even though the two ...rms are separate in legal terms

and only the upstream operations are regulated.

Economic theory has emphasized that a regulated ...rm has a natural in-

centive to overstate its costs if the regulator ignores asymmetric information

and implements the regulatory policy discussed in the previous section. This

conclusion can be de...nitely applied to the upstream monopoly. To see that,

let us compute the extrapro...t

the

obtains

since

any

which reports the truth gets zero pro...ts when the complete-information

regulatory policy is applied, and QLS (bcu) = c bcu 0 is the total output

derived from (3.1.5) and (3.1.11) for cu = bcu. It is evident that the mo-

nopolist has an incentive to exaggerate its costs (bcu > cu), because doing so

guarantees positive pro...ts [

We study now the impact of such a strategic behaviour on the down-

(4.1.2) that downstream activities bene...t from an understatement of the

upstream costs, as

LS I

(bcu;

cu)

0 if bcu < cu (the bracketed expression is

the sum of two nonnegative terms). This is not surprising, since a declared

lower value for cu reduces the access charge and thus increases the pro...t

margin of the downstream branch.

It is evident that the vertical group faces a trade-o§ when it lies. Ex-

aggerating the input costs will be desirable when the extrapro...t in the up-

stream market more than o§sets the losses on the downstream operations.

Such is the case if and only if

(4.1.4)

After dividing both sides of (4.1.4) by bcu cu > 0, we can see that the

vertical group will ...nd it optimal to overstate its upstream costs if and only

if

We may rewrite (4.1.5) as

value for bcu higher than the threshold cu (cu), otherwise it would incur losses

for its statement.

16 It is important to stress that the ...rm does not have any incentive to understate its

costs (bcu < cu). The condition for this to be the case

17

We suppose that cu (cu) = c+u if and only if cu = c+u , which implies that c cu+ = 0.17 In other terms, the highest-cost ...rm is so ine¢ cient that production cannot occur. In Figure 4.1.1 we depict graphically this situation.18 The area above the bisecting (broken) line represents the case of ...rm's overstatement of its costs, that is bcu > cu. The part of the graph under the other (solid) line captures condition (4.1.6), that is bcu < cu (cu).

Fig. 4.1.1. Incentives to lie under legal separation
Any type of the ...rm (with cu < cu+) is willing to report a cost parameter bcu 2 (cu; cu (cu)) which is strictly lower than cu+. This observation has crucial implications for the following analysis.
We are ready to solve now the regulatory game. We substitute the outcomes at the last two stages in (3.1.5) and (3.1.6), which still hold, into the regulator's maximization problem in (2.7) at the ...rst stage and get after some manipulations

(4.1.10)

20 In particular, the integral is strictly positive for cu < c+u since the integrand function is positive (as long as production occurs in equilibrium) and cu (cu) > cu, while it vanishes for cu = c+u as cu (cu+) = cu+.
21 The hazard rate H (cu) is supposed to be increasing in cu. This monotonicity property,
which is met by the most usual distributions, may be interpreted as a decrease in the
conditional probability that there are further cost reductions, given that there has already
been a cost marginal reduction, as the ...rm becomes more e¢ cient.

20

After some manipulations, we derive the asymmetric-information optimal access charge under legal separation

aLS (cu) = cu 1 ( 2

c cu) + 4 (1 3

) H (cu) .

(4.1.11)

Not surprisingly, expression (4.1.11) is higher than (3.1.10), so the in-

put price is distorted above its complete-information level according to the level of regulatory uncertainty, measured by H (cu),22 and the regulator's

distributional concern, captured by the parameter . Hence, in principle we

cannot predict whether the input will be subsidized in equilibrium or not. Only the most e¢ cient input provider (for which cu = cu ) will receive the
same price as under complete information [H cu = 0] because this is the type of the ...rm for which no one else wants to pass itself o§.23 Moreover,

notice that (4.1.11) is a decreasing function of , so the more weight the

regulator gives to the monopolist's pro...ts the lower will be the price. As

emerges from (2.7), the rationale for this result arises from the loss (1 )

that the society incurs for a transfer of a unit of money to the monopolist.

Only if there is no distributional issue ( = 1), the optimal access charge

does not need to be distorted in equilibrium. Substituting (4.1.11) into (3.1.6) yields the quantity produced by the
entrant

qELS

4 (1

) H (cu) .

(4.1.12)

It is immediate to notice that expression (4.1.12) is lower than (3.1.11). The higher asymmetric-information access charge results in a reduction in the quantity produced by the entrant.
From (3.1.5) and (4.1.12) the downstream market price is equal to

pLS = c + cu + 2 (1 3

) H (cu) .

(4.1.13)

A quick look at (4.1.13) and (3.1.12) shows that the price is distorted above the complete-information level. This is a direct consequence of the increase in the access charge in (4.1.11). However, notice that the distortion of the input price translates into a lower raise in the ...nal price.

22 Notice that a mean-preserving spread of the distribution implies an increase in H for
given costs. 23 This property is known in the literature as non distortion at the top and indicates
that the only e¢ cient price is that designed for the agent with the "best" characteristic.

21

Now we compute the pro...t of the downstream branch of the vertical group. Using (3.1.5), (4.1.11) and (4.1.12) we get

(4.1.14)

Notice that expression (4.1.14) is lower than (3.1.13), which means that the incumbent is worse o§ because of asymmetric information. Ideed, if we take the di§erence between (4.1.14) and (3.1.13) we obtain

(4.1.16)

We can easily see that the entrant is also penalized by the situation of asymmetric information, since its pro...t in (4.1.16) is smaller than the one in (3.1.13). Subtracting (3.1.13) from (4.1.16) yields after some manipulations

(4.1.17)

since the nonnegativity condition on qLES in (4.1.12) implies that the term in square brackets in (4.1.17) must be positive. This is the result of

two combined e§ects. The ...rst one is the reduction in the quantity produced

by the entrant seen before. The second factor is the decrease in the pro...t

margin. Indeed, the higher downstream price from which the ...rm bene...ts

is more than o§set by the greater access price that it has to pay.

Comparing (4.1.17) and (4.1.15) immediately yields

LS E

LS I

(as long as qELS 0). In other words, the incumbent is relatively less pe-

nalized by the situation of asymmetric information than the entrant. The

motivation is that, even if it incurs the same reduction in the pro...t margin

as its competitor, the quantity in (3.1.5) is unchanged (qLI S = qILS) since it does not depend on the access charge and thus cannot be distorted by the

regulator in equilibrium.

The downward distortion of the entrant's production in (4.1.12) entails a reduction in the total output, captured by the integrand in (4.1.18), which allows the regulator to curb the socially costly rent (if < 1) that the monopolist extracts for its informational advantage.
As shown in Appendix C, expression (4.1.18) satis...es the standard property of decreasing monotonocity in cu. This corresponds to the intuitive notion that the pro...t should increase in the e¢ ciency of the ...rm.
Using (2.2), we derive the consumers'surplus

(4.1.19)

The situation of asymmetric information makes the consumers worse o§, since their utility in (4.1.19) is lower than that in (3.1.14). The gains from reducing the informational rents in (4.1.18) come at the expense of a decrease in the consumers'surplus, since they imply allocative ine¢ ciency.

(4.1.20)

Notice that (4.1.20) may be less than zero for values of cu high enough, since the integral is quite low and the last term is likely to be negative. This means that, unlike in the complete-information case, the regulator may ...nd it optimal to tax rather than subsidize the monopolist in exchange for a higher price.
Using (4.1.14), (4.1.16), (4.1.18), (4.1.19) and (4.1.20), we derive after some computations the asymmetric-information social welfare under legal separation

It is immediate to see from (4.1.21) and (3.1.16) that the situation of asymmetric information is social-welfare detrimental, as long as the regulator has some distributional concern ( < 1). There are two elements of distortion with respect to the complete-information case. The ...rst one, captured by the term in square brackets, concerns the reduction in the consumers' surplus and in the downstream ...rms' pro...ts. The second factor, represented by the integral, refers to the part of the informational rent of the monopolist which represents a mere loss from the social-welfare point of view.

4.2. Ownership separation
The existence of asymmetric information does not change the outcomes at the last two stages of the regulatory game. Hence, still applying the backward induction procedure, we substitute (3.2.3) and (3.2.4) into (2.7) and write down the regulator's maximization problem when the privatelyinformed upstream monopolist is independent of the downstream incumbent even in terms of ownership

(4.2.4)

It appears from (4.2.4) and (3.2.7) that even under ownership unbundling

the optimal input price is set above the complete-information level. Notice

from (4.2.4) and (4.1.11) that the di§erence between the access charges un-

der the two regimes is the same as that with complete information, since the

regulator

applies

the

same

distortion

[equal

to

4 3

(1

) H (cu)] in response

to the asymmetric-information problem. This result is a bit surprising. We

have argued in Section 3.2 that the complete-information input price is less

distorted below the marginal cost under ownership separation because the

regulator can (indirectly) a§ect the outputs of both downstream ...rms rather

than only that of the entrant in order to minimize allocative ine¢ ciency.

Following this reasoning, we would have expected a lower distortion arising

from asymmetric information under owership separation. Then, why does

not this occur in equilibrium? One possible answer is that ceteris paribus -

that is, before considering the di§erent impact of the regulatory policy in the

two regimes on the quantities produced - the regulator's need for distort-

ing the price upwards is actually higher under ownership separation than under legal separation. We recognize that this explanation is incomplete and a bit cryptic, but its rationale will become clearer when we compare the informational rents received by the monopolist under the two industry regimes.
Replacing (4.2.4) into (3.2.3), we get the output supplied by the downstream incumbent

qOI S

=

2 3

[

c cu (1

) H (cu)] .

(4.2.5)

It is immediate to see from (4.2.5) and (3.2.8) that the higher input price
leads to a reduction in the production of the incumbent under asymmetric
information. Taking the di§erence between (4.2.5) and (3.1.5) we ...nd that qIOS >
qILS = qILS if and only if

c cu 4 (1 ) H (cu) > 0.

(4.2.6)

Notice that condition (4.2.6) holds when the access charge in (4.2.4) is distorted below the marginal cost (aOS < cu). In other terms, the incum-
bent will produce more under ownership separation as long as the input is
subsidized. This may not be the case under asymmetric information, so

26

we cannot predict under which regime the incumbent's production will be higher.
If we substitute (4.2.4) into (3.2.4) we derive the quantity produced by the entrant

qOES

=

1 3

[

c cu (1

) H (cu)] .

(4.2.7)

A quick look at (4.2.7) and (3.2.9) shows that the entrant will produce
less because of the asymmetric-information problem. If we subtract (4.1.12) from (4.2.7) we ...nd that qOES > qLES if and only if

c cu 2 (1 ) H (cu) < 0.

(4.2.8)

Condition (4.2.8) is satis...ed for H high enough. Therefore, we can state

that a su¢ ciently high level of regulatory uncertainty implies that the en-

trant will produce more under owership separation because of the greater

downward distortion of its quantity that occurs under legal unbundling [see

from

(4.2.7)

and

(4.1.12)

that

4 3

(1

) H (cu)

(1

) H (cu)]. Put an-

other way, the advantage of a higher input subsidization that the entrant

enjoys under legal separation in the case of complete information is more

than o§set by a decrease in quantity under asymmetric information when

the level of regulatory uncertainty is high enough.

It is also important to stress that conditions (4.2.6) and (4.2.8) cannot

be satis...ed simultaneously. Hence, under neither regime both downstream

...rms can increase their quantities.

If we substitute (4.2.5) and (4.2.7) into (2.1) we derive the price in the

downstream market

pOS = c + cu + (1 ) H (cu) .

(4.2.9)

As under legal separation, the increase in the access charge in (4.2.4) arising from asymmetric information yields a lower distortion in the ...nal price. More importantly, we see from (4.2.9) and (4.1.13) that consumers are worse o§ under ownership separation, since they pay a higher price. The rationale for this result will be analyzed when we derive the monopolist's informational rents.
Replacing (4.2.4), (4.2.5) and (4.2.9) into (2.3), we can compute the pro...t of the incumbent ...rm

ized than the entrant by asymmetric information. This is the opposite of

what we found under legal separation. The rationale is that now both ...rms

incur a reduction in their pro...t margin and output, so the incumbent will

Notice that the range between boundaries of the integral in (4.2.13) is higher than that in (4.1.18), as c+u > cu (cu) for cu 2 cu ; cu+ . The rationale is that under ownership separation the monopolist with costs cu has an incentive to report bcu 2 cu; cu+ , i.e. to mimic every more ine¢ cient type of the ...rm, and it has to be accordingly remunerated in order to reveal the
truth. Under legal separation, this incentive is weaker, since the network provider does not ...nd it pro...table to declare bcu > cu (cu). This implies
a higher distortion of total output under ownership separation in order to
curb the monopolist's informational rents, as is evident from the comparison

28

between the integrand functions in (4.2.13) and (4.1.18). Consequently, consumers will pay higher prices, as we found in (4.2.9).
Subtracting (4.1.18) from (4.2.13) we get after some manipulations

(4.2.14)

The sign of (4.2.14) is ambiguous. This is the outcome of the trade-o§ between the higher incentive to lie under ownership separation, which leads ceteris paribus to an increase in the informational rent, and the greater downward distortion in the total output, which is aimed at achieving the opposite result. Di§erentiating (4.2.14) yields

d dcu

N
(cu)

=

1

c cu (cu) 2 (1 ) H (cu (cu)) 0, (4.2.15) 3

since the expression (4.2.15) is the opposite of total output under legal separation when we replace cu with cu (cu). This result shows that the
di§erence in the informational rents under the two regimes reduces as the highest possible cost overstatement under legal separation cu (cu) increases and thus approaches cu+ which is the highest cost that the monopolist is willing to report under ownership unbundling.
Using (2.2), we derive the consumers'surplus

CSOS = 1 [ 2

c cu (1

) H (cu)]2 .

A comparison (4.2.16) and (4.1.19) gives the following result.

(4.2.16)

Proposition 3 When the regulator has asymmetric information about the production costs of the upstream monopolist in a vertically related market, ...nal consumers bene...t from the legal separation between the input monopolist and the downstream incumbent.

29

This is a straightforward consequence of the greater output distortion which occurs under ownership separation.
From (2.5) we derive the subsidy received by the monopolist, which is equal to

Zc+u SOS =

c ecu (1

c cu (1 3

[ c cu 4 (1 ) H (cu)] .

(4.2.17)

Notice that even under ownership separation the regulator may ...nd it optimal to tax rather than subsidize the monopolist. This can occur when the ...rm is highly ine¢ cient.
Substituting (4.2.10), (4.2.11), (4.2.13), (4.2.16) and (4.2.17) into (2.7), we derive after some computations the asymmetric-information social welfare under ownership separation

(4.2.18)

cu

From (4.2.18) and (4.1.21) we can see that the presence of asymmetric information still produces two e§ects. The ...rst one, which appears in the expression in square brackets, concerns the distortion in total output. Not surprisingly, the bracketed term in (4.2.18) is lower than that in (4.1.21). The second factor, which is captured by the integral, refers to the monopolist's information rent. Consistently with what we found before, we cannot know a priori whether this e§ect is stronger under ownership or legal separation.
A comparison between the expected values of social welfare under the two regimes yields a relevant result, which is summarized in the following Proposition.

Proposition 4 When the regulator has asymmetric information about the production costs of the upstream monopolist in a vertically related market, the regime of legal separation between the upstream monopolist and the downstream incumbent yields a higher expected social welfare level.

30

The proof is shown in Appendix F. Proposition 4 emphasizes that when the regulator has limited knowledge of the industry it is desirable from an expected social welfare viewpoint to separate the input monopolist from the downstream incumbent just in legal terms so that they can still belong to the same company. Such a kind of separation, unlike the ownership one, generates a trade-o§ between the incentive to exaggerate private information by the monopolist in order to have higher pro...ts and the incentive to understate this information by the downstream ...rm in order to pay a lower access charge. Hence, legal separation yields countervailing incentives within the vertical group which allow the regulator to reduce the output distortion to curb informational rents. The higher allocative e¢ ciency, emphasized in Proposition 3, leads to a greater expected social welfare level.
The result in Proposition 4 has crucial implications. Often in the literature and policy debates the regime of ownership separation between the input monopolist and the downstream incumbent is thought of as the best solution to the regulator's critical control problem, since it should remove the monopolist's practice of exaggerating the input costs in order to worsen the competitiveness of the downstream rivals. However, the monopolist's incentives to exploit its private information still play a relevant role. Our model shows that legal separation can be (expected) social welfare improving, since it creates a conict of interests within the vertical group, which reduces the negative e§ects of asymmetric information.
5. Concluding remarks
In this paper we have dealt with the problem of how to design the industry structure in a vertically related market when the regulator is charged with setting the price for the access to an upstream monopolistic input and there is imperfect competition downstream. Although the literature on the access pricing is quite extensive, this is an issue that, despite its importance after the liberalization process, has been by and large ignored in the economic research.
Empirical evidence shows that there are two main industry patterns that have so far been implemented. Under legal separation upstream and downstream operations are legally unbundled but common ownership is permitted. In contrast, ownership separation prevents a single company from controlling both activities. We have studied the impact on social welfare generated by these two industry structures of a problem that has so far played a minor role in the policy debate about access pricing: the asymmetric in-
31

formation about the industry on the part of the regulator. We have found that, while under complete information the two regimes yield the same social welfare, regulatory limited knowledge about the monopolist's input costs implies that legal separation is (expected) social welfare improving. The idea is that a trade-o§ occurs between the monopolist's incentive to overstate its costs in order to get higher pro...ts and incentive of the downstream branch to understate them to pay a lower access charge. The policy implication of this result is that owership separation should not be considered as the best solution to deal with the problem of the monopolist's incentive to raise the input costs. Under legal separation the regulator can exploit the conict of interests that emerges between the two branches of the vertical group and reduce the detrimental e§ects of asymmetric information.
We believe that the analysis can be extended in a variety of directions. We would like to mention three suggestions which are left for future research.
First of all, we have considered only two downstream ...rms, one incumbent and one entrant. However, in the literature imperfect competition is usually captured by assuming a dominant ...rm and a competitive fringe which makes zero pro...t. Would our results change in this case?
Other development would be to examine a more realistic setting where the regulator is uncertain not only on the costs of the upstream monopolist but also on those of the downstream ...rms.
Finally, it would be interesting to investigate in our setting the issues of the possible by-pass of the infrastructure by entrants and the impact on production e¢ ciency of increased competition.
Appendix A
We derive now the incentive compatibility constraint (ICCN ) of the network provider for the pro...t function in (2.5) and show that this represents a local necessary condition which is also globally su¢ cient in equilibrium if Q (cu) is nonincreasing.
The class of global incentive compatible mechanisms must satisfy the following set of conditions

N (cu; cu) N (cu) N (bcu; cu) , 8 bcu; cu 2 cu ; cc+ .

(A.1)

In order to induce a ...rm not to lie, the pro...t N (cu; cu) obtained by telling the truth has to be at least as great as the pro...t N (bcu; cu) that the ...rm could get for any report bcu.

32

Following the Baron [5] approach, we use (2.5) and rewrite N (bcu; cu) as

N (bcu; cu) = [a (bcu) cu] Q (bcu) + S (bcu) = N (bcu) + (bcu cu) Q (bcu) , (A.2)
where N (bcu) N (bcu; bcu). Substituting N (bcu; cu) from (A.2) into (A.1) and combining terms yields

N (cu) N (bcu) (bcu cu) Q (bcu) , 8 bcu; cu 2 cu ; c+u . Reversing the roles of cu and bcu implies

(A.3)

N (cu) N (bcu) (bcu cu) Q (cu) , 8 bcu; cu 2 cu ; cu+ .

(A.4)

Since (A.3) and (A.4) must hold simultaneously for any 8 bcu; cu 2 cu ; cu+ , we may write

(bcu cu) Q (bcu) N (cu) N (bcu) (bcu cu) Q (cu) .
If we divide by bcu cu > 0 and take the limit as bcu ! cu we get by applying de l'Hospital's theorem

d

N (cu) dcu

=

Q (cu) .

(A.5)

Since a derivative is a local property of a function, (A.5) is a local condi-

tion which indicates that for any incentive compatible mechanism the pro...t of the ...rm viewed across the possible types is a decreasing function of cu.

By integrating both sides in (A.5), we ...nd the local necessary condition for the incentive compatibility (ICCNLS) seen in the paper
