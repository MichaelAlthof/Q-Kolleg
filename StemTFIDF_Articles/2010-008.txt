Abstract. Global games are widely used for equilibrium selection to predict behaviour in complete information games with strategic complementarities. We establish two results on the global game selection. First, we show that it is independent of the payoff functions of the global game embedding, though it may depend on the noise distribution. Second, we give a simple sufficient criterion for noise independence in many action games. A many action game may be noise independent if it can be suitably decomposed into smaller (say, binary action) games, for which there are simple criteria guaranteeing noise independence. We delineate the games where noise independence may be established by counting the number of players or actions. In addition, we give an elementary proof that robustness to incomplete information implies noise independence.

1. Introduction
Games with strategic complementarities typically have multiple equilibria that give rise to coordination problems. Economic applications cover a wide range of topics, including poverty traps and underdevelopment (see for example Ray [24]) or financial crises (see for example Diamond and Dybvig [9], Obstfeld [20]). A widely used approach to predict behaviour in such games is by embedding them in a "global game". A global game extends a complete information game g by a payoff function u that depends on an additional state parameter  not directly observable by agents. The payoff function u coincides with the payoff function g at the true state, say , but agents have to rely on noisy private signals about the true state. This leads to uncertainty not just about their own relevant payoff function, but also--and more importantly--about the beliefs of opponents.
Frankel, Morris and Pauzner [10] (henceforth "FMP") show that as the noise in private signals vanishes, agents coordinate on some action profile that is a Nash equilibrium of the complete information game g. This global game selection of g may be used as an equilibrium prediction and to derive comparative statics results in games with multiple equilibria. Applications include Morris and Shin [17]; Cukierman, Goldstein and Spiegel

[7]; Rochet and Vives [25]; Coresetti, Dasgupta, Morris and Shin [5]; Goldstein [11]; Corsetti, Guimarães and Roubini [6]; Guimarães and Morris [12], among others. The theory has also been corroborated by experimental evidence, see Heinemann, Nagel and Ockenfels [13] and [14].
Unfortunately, the global game selection in g may depend on the fine details of the global game. A well known problem is that it may depend on the signals' noise distribution. FMP discuss the robustness of the global game selection with respect to the signals' noise distribution, and provide some conditions under which the global game selection is noise independent, that is, independent of this distribution.
In this paper, we establish two additional positive results on the robustness of global games. First, we show that the global game selection, though it may depend on the noise distribution, is always independent of the embedding payoff function u. This may come as a surprise, since the process of global game selection is often described informally as "infection" from high and low parameter regions.
Second, we provide new and simple conditions for noise independence in many-action games. We show that the global game selection in g may be noise independent if g can be suitably decomposed into smaller noise independent games. For example, we may split up a n-action game into many binary action games for which there are simple criteria that guarantee noise independence.
This approach is useful, since the simplest known criteria to establish noise independence are through counting the number of players and actions. Carlsson and Van Damme [4] show that two player, binary action games are noise independent. The global game selection is the risk dominant action profile. Morris and Shin [18] show how to find the global game selection in many player, symmetric, binary action games. Here, the global game selection is the best reply to the belief that the fraction of players choosing either action is uniformly distributed. Up to now, most applications of global games use these heuristics in binary action environments. Our result gives a simple tool to extend them to many action games.
But other criteria in terms of players and actions may also be applied. In this paper, we establish that all two player 2 × n action games are noise independent. Oyama and Takahashi [22] show that two player, symmetric 3 × 3 games are noise independent. Conversely, FMP show that symmetric 4 × 4 games may not be noise independent. An example by Carlsson [3] shows that noise independence may fail in three player, binary action games. In this paper, we establish that it may also fail in two player, asymmetric 3 × 3 games. As far as we know, it is the first 3 × 3 example in the literature. It completes the characterisation of games where noise independence can be established simply by counting the number of players or actions.
Another useful criterion that guarantees the noise independence of g is the existence of an equilibrium that is "robust to incomplete information", as defined by Kajii and Morris [15]. A heuristic argument may be found in Morris and Shin [18], but in this paper we give a formalisation. It allows one to make use of various known conditions

for robustness to incomplete information when trying to determine whether some game is noise independent. Our result is closely related to a similar theorem of Oury and Tercieux, who use a somewhat stronger, slightly non-standard, notion of robustness to incomplete information to exploit a link with so-called "contagious" equilibria [21]. Instead, we use the standard notion and give a direct proof.

Our paper is organised as follows. Section 2 contains preliminary definitions and results. In section 3, we set out by giving a simple characterisation of the global game selection process. Instead of analysing the limit of a series of global games with shrinking noise, we show that a single incomplete information game with a fixed noise structure allows one to determine the global game selection in g. Moreover, this incomplete information game does not incorporate the whole range of the payoff function u of the global game, but depends on the payoff structure of g alone. Hence, it establishes that the global game selection in g is independent of the embedding payoff function u. In section 4 we use this characterisation of the global game selection to establish our results on noise independence in many-action games. Section 5 contains the proof that robustness noise independence, based on our characterisation of the global game selection.

2. Setting and Definitions
In this paper we consider games with a finite set of players I, who have finite action sets AiI = {0, 1, . . . , mi} which we endow with the natural ordering inherited from N. We define the joint action space A as iI Ai and write A-i for j=i Aj. We say that a = (ai)iI  A is weakly greater than a = (ai)iI if ai  ai for all i  I and write a  a . A complete information game g is specified by its real-valued payoff functions giI(ai, a-i), where ai denotes i's action and a-i denotes the opposing action profile. A game g is a game of strategic complementarities1 if greater opposing action profiles make greater actions more appealing, or more precisely, if for all i, ai  ai, a-i  a-i,
gi(ai, a-i) - gi(ai, a-i)  gi(ai, a-i) - gi(ai, a-i).

§2.1. Global Games

Following FMP, we define a global game Gv(u, , f ) as follows. It is an incomplete

information game where payoffs depend on a real-valued random variable , called the

state parameter, which is distributed according to a continuous density , called the prior

distribution. For the most part, we will use  to denote both the random variable and

a specific value it assumes, but we denote the latter by  if confusion could arise. The

individual payoffs in the incomplete information game are given by ui(ai, a-i, ). f is

a

tuple

of

densities,

whose

support

that

refer

to

as

structure. Each player i  I observes a private signal xi =  + vi about , where v > 0

is a scale factor and i an error that is distributed according to the density fi. We use

1Strictly speaking, it would be more correct to say that g is a supermodular game [26, 27]. However, FMP use the term strategic complementarities in this context, so we stick to it.

4 CHRISTIAN BASTECK TIJMEN R. DANIËLS FRANK HEINEMANN
xi to denote both the random variable and the specific value it assumes, but sometimes denote the former by Xi to avoid confusion. The random variables {, 1, . . . , I} are independently distributed.
Moreover, FMP define four conditions that the payoff function u needs to fulfil.
A1 Strategic complementarities: For every value of , the complete information game specified by uiI(·, ) is a game of strategic complementarities.
A2 Dominance regions: Extreme values of  make the extreme actions dominant choices. That is, there exist thresholds  <  such that [ - v,  + v] is contained in the interior of the support of  and for all players i and all opposing action profiles a-i we have
ui(0, a-i, ) > ui(ai, a-i, ) for all ai > 0 and   , and
ui(mi, a-i, ) > ui(ai, a-i, ) for all ai < mi and   .
A3 State monotonicity: Greater states make greater actions more appealing. More precisely, there exists K > 0 such that for all ai  ai and        we have
(ui(ai, a-i, ) - ui(ai, a-i, )) - (ui(ai, a-i,  ) - ui(ai, a-i,  ))  K(ai - ai)( -  )  0.
A4 Payoff continuity: Each ui(ai, a-i, ) is continuous in the state parameter.

§2.2. Strategies in Global Games
A (pure) strategy for player i is a (measurable) function si : R  Ai and a (pure) strategy profile s is a tuple of such strategies, s = (si)iI. If x is a tuple of signals (xi)iI, then s(x) denotes the action profile (si(xi))iI. Slightly abusing notation, for x  R we also denote the action profile given by (si(x))iI by s(x). A strategy profile s is increasing if each component si is weakly increasing and left (right) continuous if each si is left (right) continuous. We say that the strategy profile s is weakly greater than the strategy profile s if s(x)  s (x) for all x  R and write s  s .

The joint density of Xi and  is given by fi

xi- v

(), so players can use Bayes rule to

derive the conditional density of :

fXi=xi () = ´Rfif(ix(ix-viv-))(())d .

Since all error terms are independent, the conditional density of X-i given Xi = xi can

be calculated as

denotes the conditional density of X-i given . We will also use the notation ^
P(X-i  E|Xi = xi) := i(x-i|xi)dx-i
E
to refer to probabilities conditional on the null set {Xi = xi}. In the special case where  is distributed uniformly, the conditional densities i(x-i|xi) satisfy the following very
useful symmetry property. (We give a derivation in the appendix.)

against the induced opposing action distribution. Let (s)i(xi) denote the set of best replies of player i conditional on the signal xi, viz the set of actions that maximise the expected payoff:

(s)i(xi) = arg max ui(ai|s, xi). aiAi
A strategy profile s is a (Bayes-Nash) equilibrium strategy profile, if it is a best reply to

itself, i.e.

ixi, si(xi)  (s)i(xi).

The upper-best reply is defined as

^(s)i(xi) = max (s)i(xi)
and determines the strategy profile ^(s). The strategic complementarities imply that if one opposing action distribution dominates another, the upper-best reply to the former is weakly greater than to the latter. In particular, ^ is monotonic, i.e., ^(s)  ^(s ) if s  s (see Topkis [26, 27] and Vives [28]). We can do upper-best reply iterations

s, ^(s), ^(^(s)), ^(^(^(s))), . . .

starting at some strategy profile s. If ^(s) is weakly greater (smaller) than s, the resulting sequence of strategy profiles will be monotonically increasing (decreasing). As the action space is bounded, the resulting sequence will then converge pointwise to an equilibrium strategy profile. In particular, choosing the greatest strategy profile given by

ixi, s0i (xi) = mi,
as a starting point, the best reply to the strategy profile s0 can only be weakly smaller, so that the iteration will converge pointwise to the (necessarily) greatest equilibrium strategy profile (see figure 1).
As is usual when dealing with games of strategic complementarities, virtually all of our results are order-theoretic in nature. By standard order-theoretic duality, each result

implies a dual result with all order-theoretic notions reversed (see Davey and Priestley [8], p. 15). We will invoke this duality throughout the text.

§2.3. Summary of FMP's Results

FMP showed that in a global game the least and greatest equilibrium strategy profile converge to each other as the noise vanishes.

Theorem. (Theorem 1 in FMP) The global game Gv(u, , f ) has an essentially unique equilibrium strategy profile in the limit as v  0. More precisely, there exists an increasing

pure strategy profile sf such that if, for each v > 0, sv is an equilibrium strategy profile of Gv(u, , f ), then limv0sv,i(xi) = sif (xi) for all xi, except possibly at the finitely many discontinuities of sf .
1
Moreover, FMP's proof implies that sf is independent of the prior distribution  (cf. their

lemma A3).

Since sf is determined up to its points of discontinuity, we will work with the left and

right continuous versions of sf , which we denote by sf and sf respectively.

To prove the theorem, FMP introduce the notion of a simplified global game Gv(u, f ) that differs from Gv(u, , f ) in that  is uniformly distributed over a large interval that contains [ - v,  + v] and individual payoffs depend directly on the private signal xi rather than on the true state . A simplified global game is much easier to analyse, as

the uncertainty about the relevant individual payoff function vanishes, and for signals xi

within [, ] the conditional densities of opponents' signals can be calculated easily as

Theorem. (Lemma A1, A3, and A4 in FMP) The simplified global game Gv(u, f ) has an
essentially unique, monotonically increasing equilibrium strategy profile svf . In the limit as v  0, svf converges towards sf in horizontal distance, that is

for all  > 0 there is v > 0 such that for v satisfying 0 < v < v, we have:

3. Equilibrium Selection in Global Games
Let g be a game of strategic complementarities. For a given global game Gv(u, , f ), we define the embedded game g() as the complete information game that has the same set of players and actions as the global game, and which has the payoff function given by u(·, ).
For g(), the global game can be viewed as an equilibrium refinement. The limit strategy profile of the global game, sf , determines an action profile sf (), which is in fact an equilibrium of the embedded game. Thus the global game approach generically selects a unique equilibrium of the game g, to which we refer as the global game selection (following Heinemann et al. [14]). In this section, we provide a conceptually simple characterisation of this selection process which shows that the selection depends only on the payoff structure of g() and on the2 noise structure f .

§3.1. Global Games as an Equilibrium Refinement
Our first aim in this section is to show that this approach can by applied to any game with strategic complementarities. Let Gv(u, , f ) be a given global game, and let g be some game of strategic complementarities. We say that Gv(u, , f ) embeds the complete information game g if there is there is a  such that g = g().
Lemma 2. For any game of strategic complementarities g, there exists a global game Gv(u, , f ) that embeds g.
We prove this by constructing a global game Gv(u, , f ) such that g = g(0).
Proof. Let u be given by ui(ai, a-i, ) := gi(ai, a-i) + ai, for i  I, ai  Ai and a-i  A-i. Clearly, each ui is continuous in , so u satisfies A4. For any fixed  and ai  ai, a-i  a-i we have
ui(ai, a-i, ) - ui(ai, a-i, ) = gi(ai, a-i) - gi(ai, a-i) + (ai - ai)  gi(ai, a-i) - gi(ai, a-i) + (ai - ai) = ui(ai, a-i, ) - ui(ai, a-i, ),

8 CHRISTIAN BASTECK TIJMEN R. DANIËLS FRANK HEINEMANN

as g is a game of strategic complementarities. So u exhibits strategic complementarities as well and satisfies A1. For ai  ai and    we have that
(ui(ai, a-i, ) - ui(ai, a-i, )) - (ui(ai, a-i,  ) - ui(ai, a-i,  )) = gi(ai, a-i) - gi(ai, a-i) + (ai - ai) - gi(ai, a-i) + gi(ai, a-i) -  (ai - ai) = ( -  )(ai - ai),
that is, u satisfies the state monotonicity assumption A3. For all ai < mi and sufficiently large i  0 we have
u(mi, a-i, i) - u(ai, a-i, i) = gi(mi, a-i) - gi(ai, a-i) + i(mi - ai) > 0,
so mi is the dominant action for   i. Analogously, there exists i  0 such that ai = 0 is the dominant action for   i. Choosing  = max{i} and  = min{i}, u satisfies A2. As we let  be distributed over a large interval containing [, ] and choose f arbitrarily, we have constructed a global game Gv(u, , f ) in which g is the embedded game g(0).
FMP show that generically, the limit profile of a global game determines a unique equilibrium of an embedded game. The following lemma slightly strengthens FMP's theorem 2 for games with finite action sets. It shows, in addition, that these equilibria are generically strict.

Lemma 3. Let Gv(u, , f ) be a global game and sf its essentially unique limit strategy profile. Then for any state parameter , sf () and sf () are Nash equilibria of the embedded game g(). Moreover, if sf is continuous at , then sf () = sf () = a is a strict Nash equilibrium of the embedded game g().

Proof. Let  be given, and first consider the case where sf is continuous at . Since

the joint action space A is finite, there is  > 0 such that sf is constant on the interval

[ - ,  + ]. Now consider the family of simplified global games Gv(u, f ) as v tends
to 0. Recall that each Gv(u, f ) has an essentially unique equilibrium strategy profile sfv , and that sfv converges towards sf in horizontal distance as v tends to zero. Since sf is constant on the interval [ - ,  + ], there must be some v > 0 such that if v < v then

svf

is

and

hence

constant

on

this

subinterval.

Choose some v < min{/2, v}. and assume that in the simplified global game Gv(u, f )

all players follow the strategy profile svf. Now suppose that in this game some player

i receives the signal xi = . Then i knows that all other players receive signals in the

interval

[

-

 2

,



+

].

As sfv is constant and equal to sf () = a on this interval,

i's opponents play the action profile a-i that is determined by sf (). As svf is an

equilibrium strategy profile, we know that sif () = ai must be a best reply to a- i for

player i. Moreover, since player i receives the signal xi = , she believes her payoff

function is exactly like in g(). Thus ai is in fact a best reply to a-i in the complete

information game g(). Since this is true for any player i that receives the signal , ai

is a best reply to a- i in the game g() for all i  I, viz. a Nash equilibrium.

If sf is continuous at  then it is constant and continuous on the interval [ -,  +].

By the above argument, for any   ( - ,  + ), sf ( ) = sf () = a is a Nash

CHARACTERISING EQUILIBRIUM SELECTION IN GLOBAL GAMES

equilibrium of any game g( ). Now suppose a is not a strict equilibrium of g(), i.e. there are i  I and ai = ai  Ai such that ai is a best reply to a-i in the game g(). Then, by the state monotonicity assumption A3, for either  <  or  > , u(ai, a- i,  ) > u(ai, a- i,  ). Yet this contradicts that a is a Nash equilibrium for all games g( ),   ( - ,  + ). Hence, a must be a strict equilibrium of g() after all.
If sf is discontinuous at , we know it is at least constant and continuous on the open interval (, + ) for some  > 0. By the above argument, for any strictly positive  <  , sf ( + ) = a is a Nash equilibrium of the game g( + ). Hence for all i  I, ai  Ai,
and all  satisfying 0 <  <  we have:

ui(ai , a- i,  + )  ui(ai, a- i,  + ).

The continuity of u in  (assumption A4) implies that for all i  I, ai  Ai,

).

So a = lim 0 sf ( + ) = sf () is a Nash equilibrium of g(). By a dual argument, sf () is also a Nash equilibrium of g().

Combined, lemmas 2 and 3 show that, at least technically, global games can be viewed
as equilibrium refinement for all games of strategic complementarities. By embedding such a game g into a global game Gv(u, , f ), and taking v  0, we find two distinguished equilibria of g = g(), namely sf () and sf ()  A, which generically coincide. FMP proved that this equilibrium selection is independent of the prior distribution , but may depend on the noise structure f . In the following subsection, we will show that it is also independent of the choice of payoff functions u(·, ) of the global game that embeds g.

§3.2. Attainability
Let g be a complete information game of strategic complementarities. The following incomplete information game, constructed around g, will be central to the rest of our results.

Definition. A lower-f -elaboration, e(g, f ), of g, is defined as the following incomplete

information

game.

the greatest action is dominant for all signals xi > 0.

Just as for global games, we define strategy profiles, expected payoffs ui(ai|s, xi), upperbest reply strategy profiles ^(s), and equilibrium strategy profiles in e(g, f ). In any

equilibrium strategy profile s of e(g, f ) we must have s(x) = 0 for signals x < 0. In

equilibrium, the behaviour of players receiving signals smaller than 0 affects the choices

of players receiving signals greater than 0 by the usual "infection" argument (cf. Morris

et al. [16]). As a consequence, even if the action profile a  A is a Nash equilibrium of

the complete information game g, the action profile a is not necessarily played in any

equilibrium strategy profile s of e(g, f ). We say an equilibrium strategy profile s of the

lower-f -elaboration

e(g, f )

an

equilibrium strategy profile s of an upper-f -elaboration e(g, f ) attains a if s(x)  a for

]).

We can use standard results (e.g. Vives [28]) on games with strategic complementarities

to analyse lower-f -elaborations. The upper-best reply function ^(s) is monotonic, and

hence there is a greatest equilibrium strategy profile s, which is increasing. The greatest

action

profile

s

attains

is

s(R

).

Definition. An action profile a  A is attained from below under f if in some lowerf -elaboration of g, the greatest equilibrium strategy profile attains a (see figure 3). In particular, we denote the greatest action profile that is attained from below under f by a(g, f ). We define attained from above under f dually, and in particular we define a(g, f ) as the least action profile used in the least equilibrium strategy profile of some upper-f -elaboration.

In the remainder of this section we will prove that in order to determine the global game selection in g, it suffices to look at a(g, f ) and a(g, f ). A first easy but useful observation is that to determine a(g, f ) it actually suffices to look at any one lower-f -elaboration. (Of course, a dual observation holds for a(g, f )).

Lemma 4. Let e(g, f ) be any lower-f -elaboration, and s its greatest equilibrium strategy profile. Then s(R) = a(g, f ).

CHARACTERISING EQUILIBRIUM SELECTION IN GLOBAL GAMES

Proof. Consider any lower-f -elaboration e (g, f ) of g with a greatest equilibrium strategy profile s that attains a(g, f ). Since s is increasing and the joint action space A is finite, we can identify s with a finite sequence z1, z2, . . . , zk, with k  R, of jump points, at which players switch to greater action profiles. If players follow the strategy profile s,
a small change in the jump point zn would influence their expected payoffs compared with s only at signals in the interval [zn-1, zn+1]. Thus the maximum distance between any two adjacent jump points zn and zn+1 must be less then 1. Otherwise, if s is an equilibrium strategy profile then, for sufficiently small , the similarly increasing strategy
profile determined by the jump points

z1, z2, . . . , zn-1, zn - , . . . , zk - 
would be an equilibrium strategy profile as well, contradicting the maximality of s. But if the distance between any two adjacent jump points is less then 1, then zk  R. Or, equivalently, s attains a  A if and only if a  s(R) = a(g, f ).
Now we may verify that the strategy profile given by the jump points z1, z2, . . . , zk can also be interpreted as the greatest equilibrium strategy profile s of e(g, f ).

Our first main result is an immediate consequence of our characterisation of the global game selection process in terms of a(g, f ) and a(g, f ).

Theorem 5. Let Gv(u, , f ) be any global game. The global game selection at any state parameter  depends solely on the noise structure f and on the complete information game g(), and is independent of u and .
More precisely, if sf is the essentially unique limit strategy profile of Gv(u, , f ), and g = g() then sf () = a(g, f ) and sf () = a(g, f ).

The irrelevance of the prior distribution  for the global game selection was already shown by FMP. It may be surprising that the choice of payoff functions surrounding g() is irrelevant as well. After all, the global game selection process is often described as an infection process, starting from the high and low parameter regions. Thus, one might think that choosing to embed g at  close to the lower dominance threshold  might influence the global game selection so that it selects a lower equilibrium compared to an embedding of g close to . However, theorem 5 tells us that will not be the case.
Another way to think about theorem 5 is the following. In economic applications, the state parameter  is typically interpreted as an economic fundamental affecting the decision problem of players. But there may be several economic variables that are candidates for the parameter . Theorem 5 tells us that the choice of the fundamental used to perturb the decision problem is irrelevant: the global game selection will be the same. It is determined by the payoff structure of the unperturbed game.

The theorem is an immediate consequence of the following three lemmas. The first lemma is inspired by a construction in the proof of theorem 4 in FMP.

12 CHRISTIAN BASTECK TIJMEN R. DANIËLS FRANK HEINEMANN
Lemma 6. Let Gv(u, , f ) be any global game that embeds g and sf its essentially unique limit strategy profile. Let g = g(). We have:
sf ()  a(g, f ), and dually, sf ()  a(g, f ).

Proof. We prove the first inequality. Without loss of generality assume that  = 0. For the moment, fix some v such that 0 < v  1. Consider the simplified global game

Gv(u, f ). We will want to assume that its random state parameter  is distributed over

an

interval

[L, R]

where

L



min{

-

1,

-

1 2

}

and

R



max{ + 1, R}.

This

will

allow

us

to compare the simplified global game with a lower-f -elaboration of g later in the proof.

For Gv(u, f ), this might mean extending the range over which  is distributed further

into the dominance regions. But that will not change its essentially unique equilibrium

profile svf, other than enlarging the range in which dominant actions are prescribed. So

this is without loss of generality.

Consider

the

lower-f -elaboration

e(g, f ),

with



distributed

on

[

1 2

,

R].

Its greatest

equilibrium strategy profile s is increasing and satisfies s(x) = a(g, f ) for x  R. We

define the profile sv as follows:

for all i  I,

 0  
sv,i(x) := si (x/v)
 a(g, f )

if

L



x

<

-

1 2

v,

if

-

1 2

v



x



vR,

if vR < x  R.

Next, we will compare the simplified global game with a "compressed" version of e(g, f ),

where all individual noise variables i have been scaled by the factor v, and  is distrib-

uted

uniformly

on

[-

1 2

v,

vR].

We

denote

this

compressed

lower-f -elaboration of

g

by

ev(g, f ). Compressing the elaboration amounts merely to a relabeling of signals. There-

fore, the restriction of sv to the signal space of ev(g, f ) is an equilibrium strategy profile

of ev(g, f ). Note also that in the games Gv(u, f ) and ev(g, f ) the distributions of op-

ponents' signals conditional on a player's own signal are identical, for all signals in the

interval

[-

1 2

v

,

vR].

Now suppose that players follow the strategy profile sv in the simplified global game

Gv(u, f ). For any player i, and any signal xi < 0, 0 is a dominant action in ev(g, f ), so that sv,i(xi) = 0  ^(sv)i(xi) in Gv(u, f ).
For xi = 0, we have sv,i(xi)  ^(sv)i(xi), since sv is an equilibrium of ev(g, f ), and
therefore sv,i(0) is a best reply to sv,i under the payoff function u(·, 0) = g. In particular,

this means sv,i(xi) must be weakly smaller than the greatest best reply under the payoff
function u(·, 0). For xi > 0, sv,i(xi)  ^(sv)i(xi), since sv,i(xi) is the best reply to sv,i under the
payoff function u(·, 0) = g, and hence the greatest best reply under the payoff function

u(·, xi) must be weakly greater than sv,i(xi) by assumption A3. In sum, sv  ^(sv), and therefore an upper-best reply iteration starting at sv yields

a monotonically increasing sequence of strategy profiles that converges to the essentially unique, increasing equilibrium strategy profile svf of Gv(u, f ). This shows svf  sv. For

CHARACTERISING EQUILIBRIUM SELECTION IN GLOBAL GAMES
the right continuous version of svf we find that sfv(vR)  sv(vR) = s(R) = a(g, f ).
Since svf is increasing, it follows that for all x  vR, svf(x)  a(g, f ).

13

Since the choice of v was arbitrary, the above argument shows that for all  > 0, there is v > 0 such that sfv ()  svf (vR)  a(g, f ) for all v  v (just take v = /R). Hence:

for all  > 0,

lim

implying

sf (0) = lim 0(limv 0sfv ())  a(g, f )

as claimed.

The next two lemmas establish that the converse of lemma 6 also holds.

Lemma 7. Let Gv(u, , f ) be any global game that embeds g and sf its essentially unique

limit strategy profile. Let g = g(), and assume that sf is continuous at . Then we

have:

sf ()  a(g, f ), and dually, sf ()  a(g, f ).

Proof. We will prove the first inequality. Consider again the simplified global game

Gv(u, f ). By (A2) there is some  such that for signals smaller than , the action 0 is dominant for all players. Without loss of generality we will assume that  = 0. Since

the joint action space is finite, continuity at the point  implies that, for some  > 0, sf

is constant, and equal to some a  A, on the interval [ - ,  + ]. Since sfv , the right

continuous equilibrium strategy profile of the simplified global game Gv(u, f ), converges

towards sf in horizontal distance, there must be v > 0 such that for v < v, sf equals sfv on the subinterval [ - /2,  + /2].

Fix some v < min{/2, v}. Consider the "compressed" lower-f -elaboration ev(g, f ), where all individual noise variables i have been scaled by the factor v, and  is distributed

uniformly

on

the

interval

[-

1 2

,

R],

with

R

the

same

as

in

the

simplified

global

game.

Assume that in this game players use the strategy profile s given by:

for all i  I,



si(x)

=

svf,i(xi) sfv,i()

if xi  , if xi > .

For any player i, and any signal xi < 0, 0 is a dominant action for i both in ev(g, f ) and in Gv(u, f ). So in the game ev(g, f ), we have

for xi < 0, ^(s)i(xi) = 0 = sfv,i(xi) = si(xi).

For

xi



[0, ],

player

i's

opponents

receive

signals

smaller

than

 +

,

since

v

<

.

So i's opponents behave as if they were following sfv,i(xi). Since the distributions of the

state parameter and of the signals are identical in Gv(u, f ) and ev(g, f ), but i's payoff

function is given by ui(·, ) in ev(g, f ) and by ui(·, xi) in Gv(u, f ), in the game ev(g, f )

14 CHRISTIAN BASTECK TIJMEN R. DANIËLS FRANK HEINEMANN

we have

for 0  xi  , ^(s)i(xi) = ^(svf)i(xi)  svf,i(xi) = si(xi),

where the inequality follows from the state monotonicity assumption A3 and the fact that

svf is the greatest equilibrium profile of Gv(u, f ).

For

xi

>

,

player

i's

opponents

receive

signals

greater

than



-

.

Since for such

signals s is constant and equal to sfv() = a, player i's opponents will use the action

profile a- i. By lemma 3, a is a Nash equilibrium under the payoff functions of the game

g. This means that in ev(g, f ) we have

for xi > , ^(s)i(xi)  ai = sfv,i(xi) = si(xi).

In sum, ^(s)  s. Therefore an upper-best reply iteration in the game ev(g, f ) starting from s yields a monotonically increasing sequence of strategy profiles that converge to an

equilibrium profile s  s. It follows that s()  s() = sf (). Since compressing

an elaboration amounts to a relabelling of signals, in the equivalent uncompressed lower-

f -elaboration there is an equilibrium strategy profile s such that s(/v)  sf (),

Thus sf () is attained from below under f , implying the inequality sf ()  a(g, f ).

Lemma 8. Let Gv(u, , f ) be any global game that embeds g and sf its essentially unique limit strategy profile. Let g = g(), and assume that sf is not continuous at . Then we

have:

sf ()  a(g, f ), and dually, sf ()  a(g, f ).

Proof. We will again prove the first inequality. Let {n}nN be a sequence that converges to  from above. By lemma 7, for any n, the greatest equilibrium profile sn of every lower-f -elaboration e(g(n), f ) attains sf (n), and hence attains sf (). Moreover, by the state monotonicity assumption (A3), the sequence of profiles sn converges to s = inf{sn|n  N} in monotonically decreasing fashion. Since the joint action space A is finite, for each x there is nx such that snx (x) = s(x).
Denote by ui(ai|s, xi ; n) the expected payoff of player i when she plays the action ai against the strategy profile s in the lower-f -elaboration e(g(n), f ). We claim that for all  > 0 and all signal tuples x  0, there is an n such that  < n <  +  and such that
iai, ui(si(xi)|s, xi ; n)  ui(ai|s, xi ; n).
But then, from the continuity of u in the state parameter (assumption A4), we deduce that for all xi  0 we must have
iai, ui(si(xi)|s, xi ; )  ui(ai|s, xi ; ),
viz. s is an equilibrium strategy profile of e(g, f ). Clearly s attains sf ().

To prove the claim, fix some x  0 and note that for all n > nx we have: iai, ui(si(xi)|sn, xi ; n)  ui(ai|sn, xi ; n),

CHARACTERISING EQUILIBRIUM SELECTION IN GLOBAL GAMES

15

since sn is an equilibrium profile of e(g(n), f ). In particular we may choose n > nx such that n <  + . In that case we find, for all n > n,

i and ai  si (xi), i and ai  si (xi),

0  ui(ai|sn, xi ; n) - ui(si (xi)|sn, xi ; n)  ui(ai|sn, xi ; n) - ui(si (xi)|sn, xi ; n)
0  ui(ai|sn, xi ; n) - ui(si (xi)|sn, xi ; n)  ui(ai|sn, xi ; n) - ui(si(xi)|sn, xi ; n)

by (A3), by (A1).

So we conclude that for all n > n

iai, ui(si(xi)|sn, xi ; n)  ui(ai|sn, xi ; n). Since {sn}nN converges to s, by the monotone convergence theorem we now find
iai, ui(si (xi)|s, xi ; n)  ui(ai|s, xi ; n).

4. Noise Independence
A game g embedded at state parameter  in a global game Gv(u, , f ) is called noise independent if its limit strategy profile sf takes on the same values at  regardless of the choice of f . Theorem 5 says that noise independence is a property of the complete information game g: a game of strategic complementarities is noise independent under one global game embedding if and only if it is noise independent under every other global game embedding.
In this section, we will use attainability to analyse how the global game selection may depend on the noise structure. Whether some action profile a can be attained from below in a lower-f -elaboration is in essence a coordination problem among the players. For each player i, there must be thresholds zi0, zi1, . . . , zik at which she is willing to switch to a greater action, given the action distribution of opponents' actions. The players' thresholds need to be mutually consistent under the noise structure f . This problem takes the simplest form--and may be solvable independent of f --if there are few players or few actions, or if some actions are very appealing for wide range of opposing action distributions.
The simplest non-trivial games with multiple equilibria are 2 player, 2 action games. For such 2 × 2 games it is known that the global game selection is noise independent; it selects the risk dominant equilibrium (Carlsson and Van Damme [4]). In a symmetric 2 × 2 game this means it selects the best replies to the conjecture that the opponent mixes over both actions with equal probability. If both the least and greatest actions are best replies to this conjecture, then the least is prescribed by the left continuous version of the limit strategy sf while the right continuous version prescribes the greatest.
But noise independence may fail quickly when the player set or the action sets of players are enlarged beyond size 2. An example of Carlsson [3] shows that noise independence may already fail in an (asymmetric) 3 player, binary action game. Oyama and Takahashi [22] show that symmetric 2 player 3 × 3 games are noise independent, but FMP present an example where noise independence fails in a symmetric 2 player 4 × 4 game. Below,

we provide two further results on how many players or actions it takes to violate noise independence. We show that any 2 player game in which one player's action space is binary (i.e., every 2 × n game) is no9ise independent. We will also give an example where it fails in an asymmetric 2 player 3 × 3 game. This gives a full characterisation of games where noise independence can be established simply by counting the number of players
or actions.

A well known, yet restrictive, criterion that guarantees noise dependence even in many player and many action games is the "p-dominance" criterion.

Definition. Let p = (pi)iI and (A-i) be the set of all probability distributions over A-i. An action profile a in g is p-dominant if for each player i and any opposing action distribution µ  (A-i) that assigns weight µ(a- i)  pi we find that

ai,

µ(a-i)gi(ai , a-i) 

µ(a-i)gi(ai, a-i),

a-i A-i

a-i A-i

i.e. ai is a best response.

If a is p-dominant for some p with iI pi < 1, then a is the global game selection (see FMP). It follows that, independent of the noise structure, a is the global game selection

in a two player symmetric payoff game if it is a best reply on the conjecture that the

opponent

will

play

with

less

than

1 2

.

The concept of attainability in a

lower-f -elaboration enables us to see why. For any f we find thresholds zi  [0, 1] such

that

(see

Now,

consider

the

strategy

profile s0 where each player i switches from her lowest action to ai at zi (see the bottom

that

reply to s0 is weakly greater than s0. Thus, an upper-best reply iteration starting at s0

converges towards an equilibrium strategy profile s that attains a.

Looking at the strategy profile s0, it becomes clear that it is unnecessarily strict to

require that players are willing to switch from 0 to a immediately. Allowing them to

reach a in many steps considerably weakens the criterion.

§4.1. A Decomposition Approach to Noise Independence
Elaborating on this idea, we will show that if there exists a suitable decomposition of a game of strategic complementarities g into smaller, noise independent games, this may be a sufficient condition for noise independence of g itself. Figure 5 illustrates the idea. If we can show that certain action profiles are attained in certain lower-f -elaborations that we obtain by restricting the strateg7y space of g, we can "patch" these strategy profiles together to obtain a strategy profile for a lower-f -elaboration of the full game g. In this case, simple known criteria for games with small action spaces may prove to be extremely useful to analyse games with bigger action spaces.
Definition. Consider a game of strategic complementarities g with joint action set A. The greatest and least action profiles in A are denoted by m and 0. For action profiles a  a , we define [a, a ] := {a~  A | a  a~  a }. The restricted game g [a,a ] is defined by the restriction of the payoff functions of g to the set [a, a ]. We write a g a if and only if a is the unique noise independent global game selection in g [a,a ], and conversely a g a if and only if a is the unique noise independent global game selection in g [a,a ].
We write 0 -g a if there exists an increasing sequence 0 < a1 < · · · < ak < a in A such that 0 g a1 g . . . g ak g a and a g- m if there exists an increasing sequence a < ak+1 < · · · < m in A such that a g ak+1 g . . . g m.
Now we may prove the following sufficient condition for noise independence.
Theorem 9. If 0 -g a g- m, then a is the unique noise independent global game selection in g. More precisely, let Gv(u, , f ) be any global game that embeds g, and sf its essentially unique limit strategy profile. Let g = g(). Then:
sf () = a = sf ().

18 CHRISTIAN BASTECK TIJMEN R. DANIËLS FRANK HEINEMANN
Theorem 9 reveals a first connection with the literature on robustness to incomplete information. Proposition 2.7 and 3.8 in Oyama and Tercieux [23] together imply that if game with strategic complementarities can be decomposed--as above--into restriced games, each of which has a strict p-dominant equilibrium with sufficiently small p (rather than "just" a unique global game selection), then a is the unique equilibrium of g that is "robust to incomplete information". The formal link to our theorem runs via the observation that if an equilibrium is robust to incomplete information, then it is also the unique global game selection (at least generically; cf. our theorem 11 and corollary 12 below), so that the conclusion of theorem 9 follows.
However, theorem 9 allows application of wide range of known criteria for noise independence besides p-dominance, such as the fact that all symmetric 3 × 3 games, all symmetric n-player binary games, and (as we show shortly) all 2 × n games are noise independent, or indeed the robustness to incomplete information of some equilibrium of the restricted game. None of these are equivalent to the p-dominance criterion--the conditions under which our theorem may be applied are strictly more general. Also, its conclusion does not hinge on the fact that a is a robust equilibrium. Thus theorem 9 establishes a more direct and more elementary result about noise independent global game selection.

Proof. In view of theorem 5, it suffices to prove that for any noise structure f , a(g, f ) =

a = a(g, f ). We will prove the first equality, the second follows by duality.

Fix some arbitrary noise structure f . By definition, there exists an increasing sequence

0 < a1 < a2 < · · · < ak < a, such that for each adjacent pair a, a in the sequence, the

unique noise independent selection in the restricted game g [a,a ] is a . Consequently, for each adjacent pair a, a there is a corresponding lower-f -elaboration e(g [a,a ], f ) with a corresponding equilibrium strategy profile s that attains a .

We claim that if s1 attains a1 in e(g [0,a1], f ) and s2 attains a2 in e(g [a1,a2], f ), then there
is a lower-f -elaboration e(g [0,a2], f ) of g [0,a2] with a corresponding equilibrium strategy profile s such that s attains a2. Consequently, there is a strictly shorter increasing

sequence 0 < a2 < · · · < ak < a with the property that for each adjacent pair a, a in

the sequence there is a corresponding lower elaboration e(g [a,a ], f ) and a corresponding equilibrium strategy profile s that attains a . By induction, it follows that a is attained

from below under f in g [0,a].

 si2(xi - (R1 + 1))

if x  R1, if R1 < x < R1 + 1, if R1 + 1  x.

CHARACTERISING EQUILIBRIUM SELECTION IN GLOBAL GAMES

19

For xi  R1, the opposing action distribution in e(g [a0,a2], f ) conditional on xi is just like that in e(g [0,a1], f ). Since s1 is an equilibrium strategy profile of e(g [0,a1], f ), we know that s1i (xi) is the best reply to s-1 i among the actions {ai  Ai | ai  ai1}. So it must be that ^(s)i(xi)  s1i (xi) = si(xi) in the game e(g [a0,a2], f ).
For xi  [R1, R1 +1], the opposing action distribution in e(g [a0,a2], f ) conditional on the signal xi (weakly) dominates the opposing action distribution conditional on the signal R1, since s is increasing. By strategic complementarities, ^(s)i(xi)  ^(s)i(R1) = a1i = si(xi).
For xi  R1 + 1, the opposing action distribution in e(g [0,a2], f ) conditional on the signal xi is just like in that e(g [a1,a2], f ) conditional on the signal xi - (R1 + 1). Moreover,
the opposing action distribution given the signal xi (weakly) dominates the opposing action distribution given the signal R1, since s is increasing. This implies ^(s)i(xi)  a1i . Furthermore, we know that si2(xi) is the best reply to s2i among the actions {ai  Ai | a1i  ai  ai2}, since s2 is an equilibrium strategy profile of e(g [a1,a2], f ). Combining, we must have ^(s)i(xi)  s2i (xi - (R1 + 1)) = si(xi) in the game e(g [a0,a2], f ).
In sum, ^(s)  s. Hence an upper-best reply iteration converges monotonically to an
equilibrium strategy profile s  s. Since, by construction, s(R1 + 1 + R2) = a2, certainly
s attains a2. This proves the claim.

Conclude there is a lower-f -elaboration e(g [0,a], f ) with an equilibrium strategy profile s that attains a. Since s is an equilibrium strategy profile, enlarging the joint action set from [0, a] to [0, m] cannot make players want to switch to smaller actions when they follow the strategy profile s. Hence a is attained from below under f given the original game g, implying a(g, f )  a.

It remains to be shown that a is the greatest action profile that is attained from below

under f . Towards a contradiction, suppose there is a lower-f -elaboration e(g, f ) of g with

a greatest equilibrium strategy profile s that attains some a > a. Let  be distributed

if si(xi) < ai, if si (xi)  ai.

For all signals xi < 0, si(xi) = ai is the dominant action in e(g [a,a ], f ). For all signals
xi  0, the opposing action distribution in e(g [a,a ], f ), conditional on xi and when players
follow the strategy profile s, weakly dominates the opposing action distribution at xi in e(g, f ) when players follow s. Since s is an equilibrium strategy profile of e(g, f ), it follows that ^(xi)i(s)  si(xi) in both lower-f -elaborations.
In sum, ^(s)  s in e(g [a,a ], f ). Thus an upper best-reply iteration converges to an equilibrium strategy profile s that attains a. Conclude that a(g [a,a ], f )  a > a.

20 CHRISTIAN BASTECK TIJMEN R. DANIËLS FRANK HEINEMANN
Yet this contradicts that a g a . So it must be that a(g, f ) = a after all. As f was arbitrary, this proves the theorem.

§4.2. Applications
Consider the global game game where payoffs depend on  as in figure 6. The pdominance criterion tells us that (c, c) is the unique noise independent selection for  > 3, as c is a best reply if one expects the opponent to chose c with probability one half. If  < -2, (a, a) is selected for the same reason, yet we cannot tell which action profile will be chosen if   [-2, 3] or whether the selection will be noise independent at all. However, by looking at 2 × 2 restricted games, and applying the risk-dominance criterion, we find that a -g() b and b -g() c for  > 0 so (c, c) is the unique noise independent selection. If  < 0, (a, a) is uniquely selected as c -g() b and b -g() a.

Figure 6. Symmetric two player three action game

As indicated, theorem 9 allows the application of more general criteria. For instance,

FMP find that symmetric binary action games are noise independent and give the follow-

ing simple criterion to determine which action profile will be selected. Let I = {1, ..., I},

AiI = {0, 1} and suppose that giI(ai, a-i) depends only on ai and the number of opponents that play 1 (this is always true if payoffs are symmetric). Furthermore, let n

denote the payoff difference on playing 1 rather than zero if n opponents play 1. Then

In

words,

game approach

selects the best reply on the conjecture that the number of opponents using action 1 is

uniformly distributed between 0 and |I| - 1. Theorem 9 allows us to apply this criterion

to games with more than two actions.

Figure 7. Symmetric three player game

Consider the three player, symmetric payoff game g in figure 7. As b is a best reply
if one expects his opponents to play (a, a), (a, b) or (b, b) with equal probability, we find that b is the unique noise independent selection in g [a,b], so a g b. Analogously we find

CHARACTERISING EQUILIBRIUM SELECTION IN GLOBAL GAMES

21

b g c, so a -g c. Then theorem 9 implies that (c, c, c) is selected uniquely and noise independently by the global game approach. Note that this result holds irrespective of the payoffs against (a, c). Also, we could set the payoffs of playing c versus (a, a) or (a, b) arbitrarily low without deterring players to play c.

§4.3. Two player, 2 × n action games
Obviously, in order to fruitfully apply theorem 9, we need as many basic conditions as possible that guarantee noise independent selection for restricted games. Just counting the number of players and actions is certainly one of the most simple conditions to check. One possible extension of a two player 2 × 2 game is enlarging the action space of just one of the players. We will show that such games are always noise independent. Let g be any game of strategic complementarities with I = {1, 2}, A1 = {0, 1}, A2 = {0, 1, . . . , m2}. For example, figure 8 shows a 2×3 game. Note that this game does not have a p-dominant action profile.

Figure 8. A 2 × 3 game with no p-dominant action profile

For any a2  A2, if (0, a2) is attained from below for some noise structure, a2 is simply

player 2's greatest best reply to player 1's action 0, and can be attained from below under

any noise structure. Now suppose the action profile (1, a2) is attained from below under

f . Then there exists a lower-f -elaboration e(g, f ) of g with an equilibrium strategy profile

s that attains (1, a2), and s may be identified with the thresholds z10 and z20, z21, . . . , z2k,

where players switch to greater actions. Without loss of generality, we may assume all

The opposing action distribution that player 2 faces at each of her thresholds z2j is

P(x1 > z10|x2 = z2j) = P(x2 < z2j|x1 = z10) := pj, j  {0, ..., k},

where the equalities follow from lemma 1 stated in section 2.2.
Let z = min{z10, z20, z21, . . . , z2k} be the smallest of the thresholds used in the strategy profile s, and let i be the associated player switching at z (that is, z = zi0). Now, if we consider a different noise structure f , we can construct a similarly increasing strategy profile s by again putting i's smallest threshold z~i0 to z, and then simply rearranging

22 CHRISTIAN BASTECK TIJMEN R. DANIËLS FRANK HEINEMANN
the k + 1 remaining thresholds {z~10, z~20, z~21, . . . , z~2k} - {z~i0} such that the k + 1 equations P(x2 < z~20|x1 = z~10) = pj, for j  {0, ..., k}
hold under the new noise structure. In this way, the action distributions of both players at all of their thresholds remains unchanged. Hence, since s is an equilibrium strategy in e(g, f ), it must be the case that s is an equilibrium strategy in e(g, f ), and clearly s attains (1, a2). So (1, a2) is attained from below under f , and we may conclude that a(g, f )  a(g, f ). By a symmetric argument, a(g, f )  a(g, f ). Thus a(g, f ) = a(g, f ), and by duality we may conclude that a(g, f ) = a(g, f ). Since f and f were arbitrary, g is noise independent. This establishes
Proposition 10. Any 2 × n game of strategic complementarities is noise independent.

§4.4. Examples of Noise Dependence
For an example where theorem 9 is of no help, turn to the game in figure 9. It is the 2 player, 4 action counterexample to noise independence that was discovered by FMP. Using the attainability criterion, we find that b -g a and b -g d, so we lack a unique focal point. All we can say is that either (a, a) or (d, d) will be selected.

Figure 9. FMP's counterexample

However, FMP's counterexample is not the smallest possible counterexample to noise independence. We conclude this section with two minimal examples. These examples show how the idea of attainability may be applied to establish the noise dependence of a game.
The first example is a noise dependent two player 3 × 3 game. This is a minimal counterexample to noise independence, since we have seen that all smaller two player games are noise independent. The second example is a noise dependent three player binary action game. It is minimal since all smaller binary action games are noise independent. As noted before, an analysis of this second type of game that establishes their noise dependence can already be found in Carlsson [3]. However, Carlsson's analysis does not fit well with the usual definition of a global game, since in his setup the players' signals are not conditionally independent, which is required to apply the theory of FMP. In our example this assumption is satisfied.

Let g be the two player 3 × 3 game given by I = {1, 2}, AiI = {a, b, c} and payoffs as

implying

that

the expected payoff of playing a given the signal x2 = ta2 is zero and equal to the payoff

of playing b. Thus there exists an equilibrium profile in the upper-f -elaboration of g in

which the action profile (a, a) is used, so the equilibrium (a, a) of g is selected by the left

continuous version of the limit strategy profile.

However,

24 CHRISTIAN BASTECK TIJMEN R. DANIËLS FRANK HEINEMANN

by the four thresholds zib, zic (i  {1, 2}) at which the players switch to greater actions. Let ia,b(xi) denote player i's difference in payoff of playing b rather than a when given a signal xi, and define bi,c(xi) analogously. We first examine the limit  = 0, so that
player 2 is informed about the true state . We find that for z1b = 0, z1c = 0.15, z2b = 0.07,
z2c = 0.34

so players strictly prefer to switch to greater actions at the thresholds and (conducting

an upper-best reply iteration) we see that (c, c) is attained from below under this noise

structure. Indeed, since players strictly prefer to switch at the thresholds, the same must

be true if we draw x2 from [ -, +] and choose  very small--this only slightly perturbs expected payoffs. And even as we very slightly perturb the payoffs of the game g, the

expected payoff differences at the thresholds remain positive. Thus (c, c) is a global game

selection for all games in some neighbourhood of the game g. This implies that (c, c) is the

unique noise independent global game selection in g for both the left and right continuous versions of the limit strategy profile sf .

Finally, consider the 3 player binary action game g given by I = {1, 2, 3}, AiI = {0, 1} and the payoffs given in figure 12. It is similar to the "Soros" game of Corsetti et al. [5].

We may think of player 3 as a large trader who can tip the balance, guaranteeing the

success of a speculative attack, if she is joined by at least one of the small traders 1 or 2.

The game has two Nash equilibria, (0, 0, 0) and (1, 1, 1).

To determine which action profile will be selected by the global game approach, we turn

to a lower-f -elaboration. Consider the noise structure f such that for each i  I, i is

Then

selection.

To

see

this, assume for the sake of argument that there is an equilibrium strategy profile where

players 1 and 2 switch to action 1 at thresholds z1 and z2. As both players have the same

payoff function and as f1 = f2 we can assume without loss of generality that z1 = z2.

Moreover, as they are willing to switch at this threshold, they must assign a probability

weakly greater than

1 2

to the event that the third player plays 1, i.e.

they assume that

player 3 switches to action 1 at some threshold z3  z1 = z2. Yet, if player 3 receives

the critical signal x3 = z1,2, she faces the opposing action profiles (0, 0), (0, 1), and (1, 1)

with equal probability (the "Laplacian" belief, see Morris and Shin [18]). So she cannot

that the result remains valid for small . Fix z1 = z2 = z3 = 0. When receiving signal

5. Robustness to Incomplete Information
A lower(upper)-f -elaboration e(g, f ) of g is "close" to g in the sense that conditional payoffs in e(g, f ) coincide with the payoffs in g with high ex ante probability. Kajii and Morris [15] examine incomplete information games that are close to some complete information game g in this sense. Specifically, they look for a Nash equilibrium a of g for which, in every incomplete information game sufficiently close to g, there exists an equilibrium strategy profile s in which players use the action profile a with high probability. Such equilibria are called robust to incomplete information. We will show that if a is robust to incomplete information, then a is attained both from below and from above under any noise structure f . Thus, robustness to incomplete information implies noise independence. Morris and Ui [19] provide a large number of criteria that establish robustness to incomplete information. These conditions may be helpful for analysing global games, especially since the LP-maximiser condition in FMP--which was thought to guarantee noise independence--has recently been shown to be insufficient by Oyama and Takahashi [22].
The main conceptual problem that we need to solve in order to use all these known criteria for robustness to incomplete information is that Kajii and Morris only look at discrete incomplete information games.
Definition. A discrete incomplete information game u consist of a finite player set I, finite action sets AiI, a countable probability space  and state dependent payoff functions ui : A ×   R. Each player receives a measurable signal Pi() = pi, where Pi can take on finitely many values and P(pi) > 0 for each pi  Pi[]. Under these assumptions, the conditional probabilities P(·|pi) are well defined, so that players have well defined posteriors over the true state  and their payoff function ui(·, ).

26 CHRISTIAN BASTECK TIJMEN R. DANIËLS FRANK HEINEMANN

Let (Ai) denote the set of all probability measures on Ai. A (mixed) strategy for player i is a function i : Pi[]  (Ai). When player i uses the strategy i, the probability that she chooses action ai given the signal pi is denoted by i(ai|pi). A strategy profile  = (i)i is a tuple of mixed strategies. The probability that the action profile a = (ai)iI is played given the strategy profile  and given  is denoted by (a|). The domain of
ui extends to mixed strategies as follows:

ui((), ) = ui(a, )(a|).
aA
A strategy profile is a (Bayes-Nash) equilibrium strategy profile of a discrete incomplete information game u if for all i  I, pi  Pi() and ai  Ai

ui((), )P(|pi) 

ui(ai, -i(), )P(|pi)

P -1[{pi}]

P -1[{pi}]

i.e. if it is a best reply to follow i on any signal pi against the opposing action distribution induced by -i.

Now let g be a complete information game of strategic complementarities. For an incomplete information game u, we define
g = {|ui(·,  ) = gi(·) for all i  I,   Pi-1(Pi())}
as the set of states where each player i receives a signal pi telling her that her payoff function is gi. A discrete incomplete information game u said to be an -elaboration2 of g if P(g)  1 - , following Kajii and Morris [15]. Although in the event g each player i knows that payoffs are the same as in g, there will still be uncertainty about the signals that opponents receive, and this uncertainty affects higher order beliefs in u.
Definition. A Nash equilibrium a of g is said to be robust to incomplete information (Kajii and Morris [15]), or more succinctly, a robust equilibrium of g, if for every  > 0, there exists  > 0, such that in any -elaboration u of g, there exists an equilibrium strategy profile  such that a is played with ex ante probability at least 1 - , i.e.
 (a|)P()  1 - .
The next theorem gives the formal link between robustness and noise independence, showing that every robust equilibrium is "sandwiched" between sf and sf .
Theorem 11. Let Gv(u, , f ) be any global game that embeds g and sf its essentially unique limit strategy profile. Let g = g(). If a is a robust equilibrium of g, then sf ()  a  sf (), for any noise structure f .

This theorem slightly generalises a similar result by Oury and Tercieux [21], who use a more restrictive notion of robustness to incomplete information. They require that a is robust not only in g itself but in all complete information games in a neighbourhood of g, and then exploit a link with so-called "contagious" equilibria to show that their notion
2-elaborations should not be confused with the notion of lower(upper)-f -elaborations, where f denotes the noise structure instead of the size of the event  - g.

CHARACTERISING EQUILIBRIUM SELECTION IN GLOBAL GAMES

27

implies that a is the unique noise independent global game selection. We can connect our theorem to their result as follows:

Corollary 12. Let Gv(u, , f ) be any global game and sf its essentially unique limit strategy profile. Suppose g(1) = g and g(2) = g for some 1 < 2. If a is a robust equilibrium of both g and g , then it is the unique noise independent global game selection at any state parameter   (1, 2). More precisely, sf () = a = sf () for any noise structure f .

Proof. Fix f and some   (1, 2). Recall that the joint action space A is finite. Since sf is increasing, it is discontinuous at finitely many points, implying
sf (1)  sf ()  sf ()  sf (2).
From theorem 11 we infer sf (2)  a  sf (1). Thus, sf () = a = sf ().
We will prove theorem 11 in the obvious way, by showing that a is attained from below (and dually, from above) under any noise structure f . So let us fix some f .

We start by discretising the information structure of lower-f -elaborations in order for

them to fit the definition of a discrete incomplete information game. Let e(g, f ) be a

lower-f -elaboration

of

g

and,

for

where pn = [n, (n + 1)),

and , r  Z, < r,

and

the

partition

P

covers

[-

1 2

,

R].

Now, for each  > 0, we may consider a discrete incomplete information game e(g, f )

based on e(g, f ), in which instead of receiving their signal xi, players are only informed about the interval p  P  that contains xi. A pure strategy profile s in the e(g, f ) is said to be an equilibrium under -discretised information if and only if it is constant on every p  P  and maximises expected payoff under this constraint, assuming that opponents

follow the same strategy. More precisely: ^

iaip,

ui(si(p)|s, xi) dxi 

ui(ai|s, xi) dxi,

xip

xip

where, as before, ui(ai|s, xi) denotes the expected payoff of playing ai  Ai.

Theorem 11 is proved if we can show that some lower-f -elaboration e(g, f ) has an equilibrium profile s that attains a. The main step in our argument is given by the following
lemma, which retrieves the robust equilibria of g in our continuous lower-f -elaborations via the discrete incomplete information games e(g, f ).

Since a is a robust equilibrium of g, if we choose R sufficiently large, there exists (by

definition) a (mixed) equilibrium strategy profile  in e(g, f ), such that a is played in

some interval p  P  with strictly positive probability. So let us choose R > 2R + 2

accordingly, thus fixing e(g, f ).

Conducting an upper-best reply iteration in e(g, f ) starting at  will give a pure

equilibrium strategy profile s that prescribes actions weakly greater than a on the interval

p.

Similarly, if we conduct an upper-best reply iteration in e(g, f ) starting at

ip, si0(p) = mi,
we find the greatest (pure) strategy profile s  s that is an equilibrium under -discretised information (see figure 13). As s is increasing, we can identify it with k  R jump points z1, z2, . . . , zk, at each of which players switch to strictly greater actions. Under discretised information, each jump point zn influences the expected payoff on all intervals p contained in [z - 1 - 2, z + 1 + 2], so the maximum distance between any two adjacent jump points zn, zn+1 is 1 + 2 < 2. Otherwise, the similarly increasing strategy profile given by the jump-points:

z1, z2, . . . , zn - , zn+1 - , . . . , zk - 
would also be an equilibrium, contradicting the maximality of s. Therefore, s  s is constant for signals greater than 2R. If we interpret s as an strategy in e(g, f ), i.e.
for all i, si(xi) = si(pk) for xi  pk,
it is an equilibrium under -discretised information, right continuous and increasing, and satisfies s(x)  a for x  2R.

Thus, if a is a robust equilibrium, then for each sufficiently small  there is some elaboration e(g, f ) of g with a strategy profile s that attains a such that s is an equilibrium strategy profile under -discretised information. As we choose  smaller and smaller, the
discretised information structures start resembling the continuous information structures

ever more closely. Intuitively, there should be an equilibrium strategy profile in some lower-f -elaboration e(g, f ) that attains a, which is all we need to show. To take this final step, we need two new concepts.

where yiai denotes the least signal at 8which player i plays some action ai  ai. The joint

Definition. A player's relative loss function in e(g, f ) is defined as

ri(s)(xi) := ui(^(s)i(xi)|s, xi) - ui(si(xi)|s, xi).

By identifying increasing, right continuous strategies with elements of M we can regard r as a function on M . To prove theorem 11, it suffices to establish that r(s) = 0 somewhere on the compact set Ma. To this end, the next lemma establishes a crucial property of r.

Lemma 14. The function r : Ma  R is continuous.

Proof. We will first show that ri(s)(xi) is continuous for each xi. For each s  Ma and for each player i, the payoff function is bounded, and the difference in payoff between playing s(xi) and playing a best reply at xi is 0 if xi < 0 and less than
Ti := max{gi(a)|a  A} - min{gi(a)|a  A}  ui(^(s)i(xi)|s, xi) - ui(si(xi)|s, xi).

otherwise. Let sn be an arbitrary sequence converging to s in the (compact metric) space

Ma. Observe that convergence in Ma is equivalent to the sn converging to s pointwise almost everywhere when the sn are regarded, as usual, as measurable functions on the

space

[-

.

Thus,

by

the

dominated

convergence

theorem,

for

any

i,

xi,

and

ai,

ui(ai|sn, xi) converges to ui(ai|s, xi). Hence, for each i, xi and ai, ui is continuous on Ma.

Since Ma is compact, ui is continuous, and Ai is finite, Berge's maximum theorem [1, p. 116] then implies that vi(s)(xi) = ui(^(s)i(xi)|s, xi) is continuous on Ma for all i, xi.

It follows that

ri(s)(xi) := vi(s)(xi) - ui(si(xi)|s, xi) = ui(^(s)i(xi)|s, xi) - ui(si(xi)|s, xi)

is continuous for all i, xi.

Next, to prove the lemma, again let sn be an arbitrary sequence converging to s in Ma. For each i, the continuity of ri at each xi implies that ri(sn) converges pointwise ri(s).
From the dominated convergence theorem we deduce that ^^
ri(sn) := ri(sn)(xi)dxi converges to ri(s)(xi)dxi =: ri(s)  2RTi.

Since the player set I is finite, this shows that r(s) = maxiI ri(s) is continuous.

We are now set to prove theorem 11.

Proof. Consider again the lower-f -elaboration e(g, f ) with  distributed over the interval

and

the

Ma .

As promised, we will show that

there is a strategy profile s  Ma such that r(s) = 0. Since r is continuous by lemma

14, r has a minimum on the compact set Ma. It suffices to show that there are strategy

profiles in Ma which have arbitrarily small relative loss.

First we will prove the following claim.

Claim. For every i  I and every  > 0, there exists i > 0 such that for all ai  Ai, all s  Ma, and all xi, xi  [0, 2R + 1] we have that:
|xi - xi | < i = |ui(ai|s, xi) - ui(ai|s, xi )| < .
Proof of claim. Choose any i. Consider the density function i(x-i|xi) of player i's opponents' signals, conditional on xi, as given by lemma 1. The induced probability

CHARACTERISING EQUILIBRIUM SELECTION IN GLOBAL GAMES

measure is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure µ (Bogachev, [2],

theorem 2.5.7), in other words, for any  > 0 there exists  > 0 such that ^

(1)

µ(D-i)   =

i(x-i|xi)dx-i  .

D-i

Since changes in xi shift the probability density function i(x-i|xi) in the real space but do not change its shape,  can be chosen independently of xi.
Now let , s, and ai be given, and assume without loss of generality that k := xi -xi > 0. Consider the strategy profile s defined by:

for all i,

 si(xi) 
si(xi) = si(xi + k)
 si(xi)

if xi < xi - 1 if xi - 1  xi  xi + 1 if xi > xi + 1

The strategy profiles s-i and s-i differ on a set D-i. Clearly, for any , there exists i > 0 sufficiently small to guarantee that |xi - xi| < i implies µ(D-i)  . Choose  < /Ti, choose  in line with (1), and then i accordingly. We have:

and thus the claim is proved.

Now, to prove the theorem, choose any  > 0, however small. We will find a strategy

s  Ma such that r(s)  . To this end, put  = /(8R) and subsequently, for each

choose

i.

Lemma 13 states that there exists a strategy profile s that is an equilibrium under

-discretised information in some lower-f -elaboration of g, and that s attains a, and is

constant for signals above 2R. By restricting s to the signal space of e(g, f ), we can

interpret s as a strategy profile of e(g, f ).

For any i  I and all signals xi  2R + 1, player i knows that her opponents receive signals xj  2R. Since s is constant and equal to some a  a for signals greater than 2R, the relative loss function ri(s)(xi) is constant for xi  2R + 1. Moreover, since s is an equilibrium under discretised information, we infer ri(s)(xi) = 0 for xi  2R + 1. Similarly, for signals xi < 0, we have ri(s)(xi) = 0, since si(xi) is equal to the least action

0, the dominant action at such signals.

We turn to signals xi  [0, 2R + 1]. On any interval p  P , s is constant and equal to

some a depending on p. For any pair of signals xi, xi  p we have |xi - xi |    i, and hence our claim above implies that the expected payoff ui(ai|s, xi) from playing si = ai varies by less than  on the interval p. Now, if ui(ai|s, xi) varies by less than  on any

32 CHRISTIAN BASTECK TIJMEN R. DANIËLS FRANK HEINEMANN

interval p  P , then ri(s)(xi) varies by less than 2 on any interval p. To see this, assume the contrary, i.e. that for some p  P  we could find xi, xi  p such that
ri(s)(xi ) - ri(s)(xi) > 2,

that is,

ui(^(s)i(xi )|s, xi ) - ui(si (xi )|s, xi ) - ui(^(s)i(xi)|s, xi) + ui(si(xi)|s, xi) > 2. Since si (xi ) = si(xi), our claim above would then imply that
|ui(si(xi)|s, xi) - ui(si(xi )|s, xi )| < ,

so that we could deduce

ui(^(s)i(xi )|s, xi ) -  > ui(^(s)i(xi)|s, xi).

Furthermore, if at the signal xi player i would play ^(s)i(xi ), by our claim she would be able to guarantee herself a payoff within  of ui(^(s)i(xi )|s, xi ):

ui(^(s)i(xi )|s, xi) > ui(^(s)i(xi )|s, xi ) - .

So we infer ui(^(s)i(xi )|s, xi) > ui(^(s)i(xi)|s, xi), contradicting that ^(s)i(xi) is a best reply.

Thus ri(s)(xi) indeed varies by less than 2 over any interval p  P . Moreover, since

s is an equilibrium under -discretised information, we find that ^

ri(s)(xi)dxi  2.

p

Otherwise, putting si(p) to some action that is a best reply at some xi  p, would yield a relative loss of less than 2 at all signals xi  p, which contradicts that s minimises
the average relative loss over p.
