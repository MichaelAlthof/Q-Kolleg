Abstract. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) is an important tool in data analyses, particularly in social science. Usually four steps are carried out which contain a large number of options. One important option is the number of factors and the association of variables with a factor. Our tools aim to visualize various models with different numbers in parallel of factors and to analyze which consequences a specific option has. We apply our method to data collected at the School of Business and Economics for evaluation of lectures by students. These data were analyzed by Zhou (2004) and Reichelt (2007).

1 Introduction
The exploratory factor analysis of a dataset consists of four steps:
1. estimating the correlation matrix R^ between the observed p items. The Bravais-Pearson correlation is the one usually used. For ordinal data Kendall's b, Spearmans rank correlation or polychoric correlation (underlying variable approach, see e.g. Bartholomew, Steele, Moustaki and Galbraith, 2002) can be used.
2. estimating the number of common factors k < p. Various criteria are used to find the number of factors: Kaiser (eigenvalues larger than 1), Parallel analysis of Horn (1965), 90% of explained variance and Elbowcriterion.

3. estimating the loadings matrix A^ of the common factors. Depending on the beliefs about the data, several extraction methods can be used: principal component (PC), principal axis (PA), maximum likelihood (ML), unweighted least squares (ULS).
4. rotating the loadings to improve interpretability. Different rotation methods have been developed, e.g. the varimax rotation if the rotated factors should be uncorrelated and the promax rotation if the rotated factors can be correlated.
2 Visualizations
We have used four plots to obtain information about our items and factor models:
correlation plot which visualizes the underlying correlation matrix of the items (see Figure 1 left). White here represents a small correlation whereas black represents a large absolute correlation. If we group the highly correlated variables together then we can see which variables will become a factor.
scree plot which is a simple Scree plot added with the decision criteria (see Figure 1 right) mentioned before. The horizontal grey line represents the Kaiser criterion, the (nearly) horizontal falling line represent the Horn criterion and the vertical lines the 10%, ..., 90% variance criterion. This plot indicates how many factors should be chosen.
factor model plot we can see for each factor model which variables are explained by the same factor (see Figure 2). These variables are combined by a grey horizontal line. A grey square indicates that the absolute factor loading is smaller than a cut-off value (default: 0.5), but still has its absolute maximum loading at this factor. The black square indicates that the absolute factor loading is above the cut-off value. The colored plot version allows to differentiate between between small and large loadings above the cut-off value.
communality plot where each curve represents one factor model and shows how much "variance" is explained by it (see Figure 3). For each model we can see where it improves the variance explanation of an item.
In all graphics except the scree plot we can choose the order of the variables. In the correlation plot the variables are arranged in such a way that variables with the largest absolute correlation are near to each other. In the factor model plot and communality plot we count, in all computed models, how often variables are explained by the same factor (based on the grey and black squares). The variables with the highest counts are placed near to each other.

3 Application

For more than ten years, each semester students of the School of Business and Economics have been asked (see appendix A) to evaluate by questionnaire the lectures they have attended. Questionnaire data for the summer term 2002, 2003, 2005 and 2006 was analyzed by Zhou (2004) and Reichelt (2007). Here we reanalyze the data from lectures in the summer term of 2003 where the questionnaire consisted of 29 questions, each item with five answers ranging from good to bad. The missing values have been replaced by the maximum likelihood for categorical data method as described in Schafer (1997, p. 239ff).
The correlation plot, Figure 1 left, indicates that we should expect around five factors. One with the variables e5-d3; this is pretty much uncorrelated with all other factors. The other four groups of variables (c4-c5, c6+c7, b3-b6, b5-e1) seem to be correlated to each other.
In the scree plot in Figure1 (right) we identify four (Horn) or five factors (Kaiser). Both explain between 60% and 70% of the total variance. Zhou (2004) identified five factors: "communication skill" (b1, b2, b3, b4, c1, c2, c3), "lecture notes" (c5, c6, c7), "course attributes" (d1, d2, d3, e5), "question answering" (b6, b6 2) and "student reactions" (e1, e2, e3, f2, f4). It might also be interesting to look at the seven factor model since the eigenvalue curve here falls down a fraction.
For the factor model plot we therefore decided to visualize all models starting from a one factor model up to a ten factor model. We are currently looking for a set of variables which form a factor and which is stable to about several factor models.
Looking for the models, especially the four till seven factor model, we see that
∑ the variables e5, d1, d2 and d3 (course attributes) form a stable factor over nearly all models. Since the questionnaire was carried out four weeks before the exams, the student could also appreciate the speed and difficulties of a course.
∑ Another set of variables is f2, f4, e1, e2 and e3 (student reactions). However, as the variable f4 also loads on a different factor, it might be better to exclude it from the factor.
∑ c5, c6 and c7 also form a stable factor (lecture notes). ∑ In the eight factor model the variables b1-b5 and c1-c4 form one factor
(communications skill). However some variables turn out to be problematic in earlier models: b3 and b5 belong either to different factors or also load on a different factor. ∑ Finally, we have two factors (f1, f3 and "question answering": b6, b6 2, b7) with a small number of items.
We end up with four or six factors depending whether we want factors with a small number of items or not. This complies with Zhou's result (2004) that a six factor model is appropriate; her final choice of a five factor model is

4 R routines
To produce our plots we have written several R routines. Figures 4 and 5 show the order how the routines should be applied:
efa generates from a data set a R object of class efa and computes a correlation matrix. Possible correlations are: pearson (default) for BravaisPearson correlation, kendall for Kendalls  , spearman for Spearmans rank correlation, cov for covariance and uv for tetrachoric correlation (slow).
efa.plotCorr visualizes the correlation between the variables (see Figure 1 left).

which variables should belong to a factor. It also incorporate steps from a more traditional approach (computing a model, creating scales and computing reliability). If a variable in a scale leads to a too small Cronbachs , it may load on different factors in different factor models. With a different questionnaire we were able, based on the factor model plot, to analyze the effect of missing value treatment and to provide a better interpretable factor model.
