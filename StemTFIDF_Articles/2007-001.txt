3One could also assume that R&D is relatively more skill-intensive than production. The extreme assumption of skilled and unskilled workers being the only inputs in R&D and production, respectively, just simplies the model.

6In an alternative setup, investment decisions might be made before production takes places. Then rms also face strategic motives to undertake R&D investment. However, this would not change the results of the paper. The strategic motives for R&D investment are also well understood and discussed in, for instance, Lin and Saggi (2002), Neary (2002) and Rosenkranz (2003).

Proposition 1. For positive levels of intra-industry trade lower trading barriers (lower values of t) will increase total output and the investment of rms in both process and product R&D. Higher investment in process and product innovations will translate into further changes in output, which induce rms to invest even more in both types of R&D. Thus, process and product R&D are found to be complementary.

he nlysis of eqution @ISA leds diretly to

Proposition 2. Trade liberalization has three competing eects on relative skill demand. First, lower trading barriers increase the investment in product and process innovation, which translates
IH

into higher demand for skilled workers. Second, investment in process innovation reduces the per
unit requirements of unskilled labour in production. Hence, for any given level of output demand
for the unskilled declines. The third eect works in the opposite direction. Trade liberalisation
increases output and raises the demand for unskilled workers holding @kiA constant.
