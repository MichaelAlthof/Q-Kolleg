Abstract
This paper explores the optimal risk sharing arrangement between generations in an overlapping generations model with endogenous growth. We allow for nonseparable preferences, paying particular attention to the risk aversion of the old as well as overall "life-cycle" risk aversion. We provide a fairly tractable model, which can serve as a starting point to explore these issues in models with a larger number of periods of life, and show how it can be solved. We provide a general risk sharing condition, and discuss its implications. We explore the properties of the model quantitatively. Among the key findings are

the following. First and for reasonable parameters, the old typically bear a larger burden of the risk in productivity surprises, if old-age risk-aversion is smaller than life risk aversion, and vice versa. Thus, it is not necessarily the case that the young ensure smooth consumption of the old. Second, consumption of the young and the old always move in the same direction, even for population growth shocks. This result is in contrast to the result of a fully-funded decentralized system without risk-sharing between generations. Third, persistent increases in longevity will lead to lower total consumption of the old (and thus certainly lower per-period consumption of the old) as well as the young as well as higher work effort of the young. The additional resources are instead used to increase growth and future output, resulting in higher consumption of future generations.

1 Introduction
One can distinguish pension system along three dimensions (see Lindbeck and Persson (2003)): defined benefit versus defined contribution; funded versus pay as you go; and actuarial versus non-actuarial. The first dimension involves intergenerational risk sharing: how are macro-economic risks distributed over various generations? In particular, in defined-benefit systems, the retired generations are shielded from macro-economic risks. In definedcontribution systems, in contrast, these generations are bearing some of the investment risk. The second dimension relates to intergenerational redistribution: are there predictable transfers from the young, working generations to the retired generations? The third dimension, finally, involves the link between contributions and benefits on an individual level. A system is actuarially fair if the individual premium paid corresponds to the actuarial value of the additional pension benefits that are being accumulated.
This paper explores the first two dimensions of an optimal pension system. In exploring optimal pension systems, we distinguish between predictable intergenerational transfers and optimal risk sharing. Hence, in contrast to Merton (1983) and Krueger and Kubler (2002, 2005), we allow the government to enhance intergenerational risk sharing without necessarily implementing a pay-as-you-go system. Indeed, defined-benefit funded pension systems that link benefits to wage rates and absorb financial-market shocks by adjusting pension premia paid by the young can help to trade risks between the young who are long on human capital and the old who are long on financial capital. In contrast to defined-benefit pay-as-you-go systems, these funded systems enhance risk sharing without crowding out capital formation. We in effect analyze the optimal mix between defined-benefit and defined-contribution pensions as part of the optimal risk sharing scheme while at the same time determining the optimal mix between funded and pay-as-you-go financing as part of optimal redistribution between the old, young and future generations.
To investigate optimal intergenerational redistribution and optimal intergenerational risk sharing in a general equilibrium setting, we develop a stochastic overlapping generations model of a closed economy featuring endogenous growth. Optimal risk sharing under an ex-ante welfare criterion has been explored in a partial-equilibrium setting by Gordon and Varian (1988), Shiller (1999), and De Menil, Murtin and Sheshinski (2005). Our analysis builds on the general equilibrium model of Bohn (1998, 1999, 2003, 2005),

who investigates optimal risk sharing under an ex-ante welfare criterion between overlapping generations in an exogenous growth model with capital accumulation. Regarding related contributions on this issue, see also Olovsson (2004), for optimal risk sharing under an ex-post criterion, see Blanchard and Weil (2001), Demange (2002) and Barbie, Hagedorn, and Kaul (2003, 2004) while for the role of agent heterogeneity, see e.g. Conessa and Krueger (1999). We extend Bohn's analysis by incorporating endogenous growth so that we can also explore the optimal response of long-term growth to various productivity and demographic shocks. Moreover, we integrate various elements that Bohn has studied in separate papers, such as endogenous labor supply (see Bohn (1998)), productivity shocks (in labor productivity, factor productivity, and depreciation, see Bohn (1998)) and demographic shocks (fertility and longevity, see Bohn (1999)). We explore also how government transfers between the generations should optimally respond to various shocks and clearly distinguish between predictable intergenerational transfers and optimal risk sharing.
Key to studying issues of risk sharing is the issue of risk aversion. For that reason, we pay particular attention to the distinction between intertemporal substitution and risk aversion, as formulated by Epstein and Zin (1989) or Weil (1990). In fact, as in Bohn (1998), we also allow for risk aversion of the young agents, which one may either read as a desire of the social planner towards insuring the yet-unborn or life-risk aversion of young agents before they are able to participate in market activities. The life risk aversion parameter will play a crucial role.
As in the classic overlapping-generations model of Diamond (1965), at any point in time two generations are alive. Only the older generation participates in the capital market and is thus subject to capital-market risks. The younger generations works and is subject to labor-income risks. These two overlapping generations can not trade risks in the capital market because the young cannot participate in the capital market before the shocks occur and thus cannot insure against the realization of uncertainty at their birth. An alternative interpretation is that the young cannot borrow against their human capital to invest in the capital market. The young who are long on human capital and the old who are long on physical capital thus have to rely on government intervention to trade and diversify risks. To illustrate, through the pension system, the government in effect can create new non-tradable assets that are not traded in financial markets and give the old a claim on labor
2

income and the young a claim on capital income. By endowing the various generations with net positions in these assets, the government can in principle create an insurance equilibrium that would emerge if agents could freely trade ex ante. The government can trade not only risks between these two overlapping generations but also shift risks between current generations and future generations through capital accumulation. In this way, the government can engineer also implicit trades between non-overlapping generations. We thus consider risk sharing both within periods between overlapping generations and across time between non-overlapping generations.
We consider a social planning problem and characterize some necessary properties of optimal risk sharing arrangements across generations. Our economy features three imperfections calling for government intervention. First, the endogenous growth feature implies an externality in capital formation, which calls for an investment subsidy. Second, the intergenerational distribution may not be optimal from the point of view of a social planner, who thus may want to engage in intergenerational redistribution. Third, ex-ante trading in risks between generations is not possible because generations can participate in capital markets only after they are born and most shocks have already materialized. Shifting risks to the groups who can best bear them can thus create an ex-ante Pareto improvement and maintains incentives for risk-taking in general equilibrium. Improved risk sharing generates a Pareto improvement only in an ex-ante sense and not in an ex-post sense. Indeed, thinking about risk sharing before shocks actually hit helps to avoid divisive battles about intergenerational redistribution after the shocks have in fact materialized.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. After Section 2 formulates the model, section 3 sets up the social planners problem and interprets the conditions for optimal intergenerational risk sharing. Section 4 solves the social planners problem. It investigates the solution to the steady state, showing that the calculation of the equilibrium boils down to solving one equation in labor supply. For the dynamics, it relies on using log-linearization techniques rather than projection algorithms as in Krueger and Kubler (2004) in order to derive insights into the linearized behaviour around the steady state. In particular, it is shown that the dynamics of the model is characterized by a single, endogenous state vector, which combines ex-ante utilities as well as the current capital stock. We thus provide a flexible framework that can be used and calibrated as a workhorse for exploring intergenerational risk shar-
3

ing with endogenous growth. Section 5 explores how the social optimum can be decentralized through a pension system. Section 6 provides some quantitative explorations of the model and investigates the factors determining optimal intergenerational distribution and risk sharing. Section 7 concludes.
We obtain the following key results.
1. We provide a general characterization of the optimal risk sharing condition, see in particular propositions 1, 2 and 3. A detailed interpretation is provided subsequently to proposition 3.
2. An endogenous growth model is provided, which is fairly tractable, despite featuring endogenous labor supply, a number of different shocks and nonseparable preferences. In passing, we provide the conditions necessary for balanced growth under Epstein-Zin preferences, see section 3.2.1 and appendix A.2. In special cases, it is possible to characterize the steady state completely, while it generally requires solving a one-dimensional equation characterizing steady state labor supply, see section 4 and in particular equation (62) and appendices A.4.5 and A.4.7.
3. We use log-linearization techniques to characterize the response to shocks, see propositions 2 and 3 as well as appendices A.1 and A.4.8, including implications for risk premia, see appendix A.3. It should be understood that this is a "small-shock" approximation or an approximation to shocks with bounded support, see Samuelson (1970) and the discussion in Judd and Guu (2001). Despite the limitations of loglinear approximations, this provides a useful starting point for further explorations of risk-sharing with higher-order numerical techniques, or, alternatively, for searching for interesting special cases, which can be solved analytically.
4. The endogenous dynamics can be shown to solve a third-degree polynomial in a single state variable, with typically only one stationary solution. This is shown explicitely in appendix A.5. Thus, the model is suitable for exploring a rich set of features while keeping the amount of analytics moderate, providing a starting point and intuition for models featuring a larger number of periods of life.
4

5. A number of interesting insights emerge from the quantitative exploration of the model (see section 6). The usual caveat, that these statements are strictly valid only for the parameter ranges investigated (and should not be read as globally valid theorems) applies.
(a) At a benchmark parameterization, the old bear a smaller burden of the risk in productivity surprises, if old-age risk-aversion is larger than life risk aversion, but a larger one, if the old-age risk aversion is smaller, see equation (53) and section 6.5 . Thus, whether young agents should insure the old agents against the random returns on stock markets due to the uncertainty in technological progress depends on how one views the risk aversion of old people versus the desire to ensure the yet-unborn against their "life-risk". Note how a fully-funded defined-contribution system, where the old save for retirement by holding equity, would lead to an equal sharing of the productivity risk between young and old in the case of full depreciation, while a defined-benefit system would impose the entire risk on the young. Neither solution is typically optimal from a social planners perspective, although the defined contribution private capital system seems to be optimal in some special circumstances with respect to productivity shocks that equally affect labor and capital income.
(b) Consumption of the young and the old always move in the same direction, even for a population growth shock, where the size of the new young generation is larger than expected, see section 6.6 . This result is in contrast to the result of a fully-funded decentralized system without risk-sharing between generations: there, the old would receive higher consumption (due to the increase in return to capital), while the young would receive lower consumption (due to decreasing marginal returns in labor from the larger working population).
(c) Persistent increases in longevity will lead to lower total consumption of the old (and thus certainly lower per-period consumption of the old) and the young as well as higher work effort of the young. The additional resources are used to increase growth and future output, resulting in higher consumption of future generations, see 6.7 . Thus, increases in life-expectancy require old agents not only
5

to get by with less per period but also with less in total, in contrast to what a defined benefit system or standard insurance contracts might offer.

2 The model
2.1 Motivation and Overview
We aim at providing a model in which the key features can be studied, while remaining tractable. As a starting point, we follow Uhlig and Yanagawa (1996) and construct an overlapping generations model with capital and endogenous growth, effectively delivering an AK model. This eliminates capital as a state variable, thus simplifying the analysis. Since we want to study both risk aversion and intertemporal substitution, we keep them separate using Epstein-Zin preferences. As sources of risks, we allow for variations in factor productivities, depreciation, longevity, and population growth.

2.2 The environment
Consider a discrete time overlapping generations model with t = 1, 2, . . . in which all agents live for two periods, and where random shocks occur at the beginning of each period. For convenience, tables 1 and 2 summarize the symbols. Let ct,y, ct+1,o denote the per-capita consumption of the representative agent born at the beginning of period t when young and when old, respectively. Agents work only during the first period of their lives. nt denotes labor supply of the generation born in period t. t+1 stands for be the fraction of the second period during which the old are actually alive to enjoy consumption. t+1 is an exogenous variable known at the beginning of period t + 1. It measures the remaining expected life-time of the old given the medical and demographic knowledge at the beginning of period t + 1 . We define ct+1,o as total consumption of the old in the second period, so that ct+1,o/t+1 represents consumption of the old per unit of time. Given some utility q(∑) for old-age consumption per unit of time, total utility when old is

Ut,t+1 = t+1q

ct+1,o t+1

(1)

6

We wish to distinguish intertemporal elasticity of substitution from risk aversion. We therefore use some concave and differentiable function x(∑) to increase the curvature of Ut,t+1 before taking expectations and undoing this curvature again. Furthermore, we allow for risk aversion to life-time risk (or, alternatively, for a preference of the social planner towards equality across generations). Overall preferences of the generation born at the beginning of time t (conditional on the information that is available during that period) are assumed to be given by

Ut,t = U (ct,y, nt, ct+1,o; t+1)

= z u (ct,y, nt) + x-1 (Et [x (Ut,t+1)])

=z

u (ct,y, nt) + x-1

ct+1,o t+1

(2) , (3)

where u(∑, ∑) is an instantaneous utility function in consumption and work effort during the first period of life, and z(∑), x(∑) and q(∑) are strictly increasing and continuously differentiable functions such that U (.) is strictly concave in ct,y, nt and ct+1,o.
As an important special case, consider

where   0 and     0, see also equation (44). This specification and its consequences are discussed in greater detail in section 3.3.
For the generation which is old at the beginning of the planning period, U0,1 are the preferences at the start of period 1, see equation (1), and

U0,0 = z(u0 + x-1 (E0 [x (U0,1)])

for some parameter u0 are the preferences of the initially old, when considering them ex ante, i.e. behind the veil of ignorance before the uncertainty about the first period is resolved. We have incorporated z(∑) and u0 as a normalization in order to compare utilities of the initially old and agents living
in two periods in the same units, when studying the social planners problem.

Let the population of the young at date t be t, and denote the growth factor of the young population as

t

=

t t-1

.

(6)

We use capital letters to denote aggregate variables, so that Ct,y = tct,y, and so on. With kt-1, we denote the capital stock available for production per old person at date t. Thus, Kt-1 = t-1kt-1 represents the aggregate capital stock in period t.
The aggregate production function is given by

Yt = AtKt-1f (Ztnt),

(7)

for some positive, concave, strictly increasing and strictly concave function f (∑). Here, At stands for a total factor productivity parameter and Zt represents a labor-specific productivity parameter. Aggregate production Yt is proportional to the aggregate capital stock. We are thus essentially assuming an AK model. Note that labor per young person nt rather than aggregate labor tnt appears as an argument of the function f (∑). This aggregate AK production function can arise from a decentralized production economy with a production externality that is proportional to the capital stock per young person, Kt-1/t, see section 5.
With yt, we denote aggregate production, divided by the population of the old (i.e. yt = Yt/t-1)

yt = Atkt-1f (Ztnt).

(8)

Aggregate feasibility requires that

Ct,y + Ct,o + Kt = Yt + (1 - t)Kt-1,

(9)

where we allow for time-variation in the depreciation rate t. Expressed relative to the older population, this equation reads (after substituting (8) to eliminate yt)

ct,yt + ct,o + ktt = (Atf (Ztnt) + 1 - t) kt-1.

(10)

The vector (Zt, At, t, t, t)  S is stochastic and iid, and where S = RI +5 +. k0 and 0 are given and non-random, and we normalize 0 = 1 .

ht = ((Zt, At, t, t, t), . . . , (Z1, A1, 1, 1, 1))

denotes the history up to and including t. Let Ht = {ht | all ht} = St  RI 5t

denote the set of all histories up to and including t and let H =

 t=1

Ht

denote their union.

Let some initial level of capital k- 1 be given.

Definition 1 A feasible allocation is a mapping from the set of all histo-
ries into a vector of positive real numbers,  : H  RI +5 , such that k-1 = k- 1 and the vector (ct,y, ct,o, nt, kt) = (ht) satisfies (10) for all histories ht  H.

Associated with a feasible allocation are ex-post utilities Ut,t = Ut(ht), U0,1 = U0(h1).

3 The social planners problem

The social planner maximizes the utility of the agents (2) subject to the feasibility constraint (10) given the exogenous stochastic process (Zt, At, t, t, t). In this connection, one needs to take a stand on whether agents born at the same time but with different histories are different agents or not. If they are different, then "insurance" of young agents against shocks during their period of birth (i.e. redistributing from young agents born in "good" times to young agents born in "bad" times) will typically not constitute a Paretoimprovement. Indeed, this would be a redistribution from good-state agents to bad-state agents.

Definition 2 [PO 1] A non-insurance Pareto optimum is a feasible allocation with associated "ex post" utilities Ut,t (i.e. (2)) and U0,1, see (1), such that no other feasible allocation exists that attains equally large utilities for all histories and generations and a strictly larger utility for at least one history and generation.

When contemplating insurance, the social planner compares states with different population sizes. In particular, the social planner treats all agents born at the same date and under the same history in the same way and thus assigns the same weight per person across different states of nature. Hence, the "ex-ante" preferences of the social planner for generation t > 0 at the beginning of time amount to

Ut,0 = E0 [tUt,t] .

(12)

9

The "ex-ante" preferences of the social planner for the initial old are given by U0,0 stated in (5) in view of our normalization 0 = 1.
Definition 3 [PO 2] A Pareto optimum with insurance is a feasible allocation with associated "ex ante" utilities U0,0 (see (5)) and Ut,0 ((12 )), such that no other feasible allocation exists attaining equally large ex-ante utilities for all generations and strictly larger ex-ante utility for at least one generation.
Clearly, any Pareto optimum with insurance is also a non-insurance Pareto optimum, but not vice versa. As an example, suppose that in some allocation A, a particular generation receives consumption c - µ if times are bad and c + µ if times are good, for some µ > 0. Suppose that bad times and good times are equally likely. Suppose finally that some alternative allocation B exists, equivalent in all aspects, except that this generation then receives consumption c in both eventualities. In view of the concavity of the preferences, allocation A could not be a Pareto optimum with insurance, since allocation B provides insurance ex ante. However, allocation A might well be a non-insurance Pareto optimum, since the generation born in good times is considered to be different from the generation born in bad times. Thus, conditions necessary for a non-insurance Pareto optimum are also necessary for a Pareto optimum with insurance. Voluntary schemes can implement non-insurance Pareto optima (see e.g. Blanchard and Weil (2001) and Barbie, Hagedorn and Kaul (2003, 2004)). Insurance optima, in contrast, require compulsory participation to commit generations to the ex-post redistribution that is implied by ex-ante insurance.
Pareto optima with insurance are more interesting for our purposes because the issue of intergenerational risk sharing among the yet-unborn is at the heart of our analysis. One should bear in mind, however, that our analysis involves a choice regarding the welfare weights assigned to agents of the same period born under different histories: their relative weights correspond to the relative probabilities of their specific histories.
To provide a single objective for the social planner, we follow Bohn (2003) in formulating a weighted sum of the ex-ante utilities of the various generations with (t)t=0 as a sequence of (nonstochastic) welfare weights.
10

(13)

This social optimum implements a particular Pareto optimum with insurance. Using (12), we can write the social objective function as

To focus on stationary solutions, we implement exponential discounting so that t = t.

3.1 First-order conditions
Consider the problem of finding a social optimum for welfare weights t = t. Let tt be the Lagrange multiplier on the aggregate feasibility equation (9) so that t-1tt is the Lagrange multiplier on the feasibility constraint (10). For ease of notation, assume that random variables can only take one of finitely many values, each with positive probability given any history. Let Ht be the set of all histories up to and including t, and let Prob(ht) be its unconditional probability. The Lagrangian then amounts to

We have made the dependence of only t and Ut,t on ht explicit. In fact, the population, their growth rates and all economic choices at date t, like ct,y or kt, are similarly functions of ht.
Dropping the argument ht, the first-order conditions are

(16) (17) (18)

In equation (16) we have been a bit more formal than usual. A more gen-

eral treatment would involve treating this equation as an equality between

measures or their Radon-Nikodym derivatives. The right hand side of that

equation involves taking the derivative of a conditional expectation with re-

spect to one of its arguments. To be more explicit (and after cancellations

of the conditional probability terms on both sides of the equation), (16) can

be rewritten as

is a "discounting correction" due to the separation of intertemporal substi-

Define wt to be the marginal social productivity per unit of labor:

(23)

and the social rate of return as

Rt = Atf (Ztnt) + 1 - t.

(24)

We can then write the fourth first-order condition as a familiar asset price equation
1 = Et[mt+1Rt+1].
Substitute t from (15), t+1 from (19), and Atf (Ztnt) + 1 - t from (24) into (18) to obtain

where dt is defined in (20) and at is defined in equation (28).

Proof: Direct. ∑

In the special case of a linear z(∑), the terms z(at) and z(at-1) drop out and one obtains the familiar condition, equating marginal utility of consumption for the young to a constant factor times marginal utility of consumption for the old "state by state", and adjusted with the risk curvature term.
In the general case, log-linearization helps to deliver further insights. For the variables in (29), denote with an upper bar some benchmark value for each parameter, which we assume to be known as of date t - 1 or possibly earlier, and which together satisfy equation (29). We use an inverted hat to denote the logarithmic deviation of a variable from this benchmark. Thus, for example,
ct,y = cØt,y exp (ct,y)

For any twice differentiable function y = f (x), define the logarithmic

derivative

f

=

f (x)x f (x)

=

 log(f (exp(log(x))))  log(x)

with the latter equation valid only if x > 0 and y > 0. Further, define the negative logarithmic derivative of its first derivative per

µf

=

-

f (x)x f (x)

For example, if f (x) = cx, then f =  and µf = 1 - . Often, µf arises as an elasticity.
We shall keep a subindex t to denote the period for which the approximation applies. By assumption, the approximation is around a point known at t - 1 or earlier. For functions with two arguments, we shall also note the argument(s) with respect to which the derivative is taken. For example, for

14

some given utility function u, the intertemporal elasticity of substitution is given by the inverse of µuc,c,t, whereas the cross-partial is given by

µuc,n,t

=

-

unc(cØt,y, nØt)nØt uc(cØt,y, nØt)

.

Furthermore, define the argument share

t

u(cØt,y , aØt

.

A complete, explicit list of all logarithmic derivatives can be found at the beginning of appendix A.1.

Proposition 2 [The loglinear risk-sharing condition.] Optimal intergenerational risk sharing implies the following first-order approximation to (29) in log-deviations around the chosen benchmark,

where

µz,tat + µuc,c,tct,y + µuc,n,tnt = µz,t-1at-1 + dt + µq,t (ct,o -  t)

(31)

at = t (u,c,tct,y + u,n,tnt) +(1 - t) ((1 - q,t+1)Et[ t+1] + q,t+1Et[ct+1,o])
dt = µx,t ((1 - q,t) ( t - Et-1[ t]) + q,t (ct,o - Et-1[ct,o]))
Proof: Calculate or follow the calculations in appendix A.1. ∑

(32) (33)

Consider the standard case in which both z(∑) and x(∑) are linear (so that
µx,t = µz,t = µz,t-1 = 0) and in which old and young agents feature the same risk aversion in consumption, i.e. µq,t = µuc,c,t). If additionally, labor is assumed to be constant (i.e. nt = 0) or u(c, n) is assumed to be separable in c and n (i.e. µuc,n,t = 0), one obtains

ct,y = ct,o -  t,

(34)

In that case, the percentage changes of the consumption of the young as well as of the old per unit of time should be exactly the same. One may want

15

to consider this as a natural benchmark for risk sharing between young and old.
If labor is not assumed to be constant and u(c, n) is not separable, equation (31) becomes instead

ct,y

+

µuc,n,t µuc,c,t

nt

=

ct,o

-

 t,

(35)

where one should note that µuc,n,t can have either sign. Consider the case where consumption and leisure are substitutes and hence, µuc,n,t < 0. If circumstances are such that the social planner commands more work from the young, nt > 0, the associated decline in leisure enjoyed by the young will make a marginal unit of consumption for the young relatively more valuable. In order to keep the total increase in marginal utility from consumption the same for both generations, the relative consumption decrease of the young should be smaller than the relative consumption decrease of the old per unit of time (i.e. ct,y > ct,o -  t) . The direction reverses if leisure and consumption are complements, µu,t,nc > 0. Then, changes in leisure of the young (i.e. -nt) are associated with changes in relative consumption of the young vis-a-vis the old, ct,y - (ct,o -  t), which are of the the same sign. With complementarity between leisure and consumption, changes in leisure are associated with changes in consumption that further increase the impact of leisure on the overall utility level of the young. Intuitively, decreases in leisure reduce the marginal utility of the young so that the young not only obtain less leisure but also get less consumption relative to the old.

3.2.1 Scale Invariance and Balanced Growth
We wish to avoid effects from rescaling the units in which e.g. capital is measured. An alternative interpretation is that we seek a solution delivering a balanced growth path. Thus,
Definition 5 Let the allocation
(ht) = (ct,y, ct,o, nt, yt, kt)
be a solution to the social planners problem, given initial capital k- 1. Let t(ht) be the implied argument share, see equation (30). The preference

16

specification1 is said to be scale invariant, if for all scalars  > 0, ~ is a solution to the planners problem with initial capital k- 1, where
~ (ht) = (ct,y, ct,o, nt, yt, kt)

and if additionally the implied argument share ~t is unchanged (i.e. ~t(ht) = t(ht)) for all histories ht.

Scale invariance yields a number of implications (see the appendix):

u,c,t u,n,t

=

- ct,y , wtnt

0

=

-µuc,c,t

+

µuc,n,t

u,c,t u,n,t

+ 1,

µuc,c,t = µq,t+1,

u,c,t = q,t+1.

(36)
(37) (38) (39)

If in addition we impose that µuc,c,t is constant over time (i.e.   µuc,c,t), we can derive a semi-closed form for the utility function u(c, n), as is wellknown from the literature, see e.g. King and Plosser (1989):

u(ct,y, nt)

=

(v (nt )ct,y )1- 1-

(40)

up to a constant, if  = 1 and

for  = 1.

u(ct,y, nt) = log ct,y + v(nt)

(41)

3.3 Epstein-Zin Preferences
We now provide a particular parametric example, satisfying the general implications listed in subsection 3.2.1. This parametric example is therefore "special" only insofar the various elasticities and logarithmic derivatives have been assumed to be constant.
1Note that the production side is already made "scale invariant" by construction, i.e. our assumption about AK-type endogenous growth.
17

We use the preference specification of (40), i.e.

u(c, n)

=

(c v(n))1- 1-

(42)

with  = 1. We restrict v(n) to be strictly positive and such that u(c, n) satisfies strict concavity and strict monotonicity. Define its logarithmic derivative,

v (n)

=

v(n)n . v(n)

(43)

Note that v(n) < 0. As before, we let

v,t = v(nØt),

where nØt is some chosen benchmark. The utility function is

3.3.1 Preferences and the length of life.

If  < 1 and given a total amount ct+1,o of consumption when old, agents prefer a longer life with a fairly small amount of consumption per unit of time to a shorter life with a fairly large amount of consumption per unit of time. This is not so, however, if  > 1 with the preference specification above, and indeed, the utility function then even has the feature, that old agents strictly prefer a shorter life to a longer life. Put differently, committing suicide is optimal. This is obviously an undesirable feature. As a further consequence, note that with the preferences as defined above, the limit for   1 is not well defined.
There are at least three ways to resolve this conundrum. One possibility is to modify preferences when old so as to generate strictly positive utility, whenever the agent is alive. This can be done e.g. by modifying

q(c)

=

(c

+

c)1- - 1-

c1- ,

(46)

for some "baseline" level of consumption c > 0. With this, total utility while

old is

q

c 

=

c 

+c

1- - c1-

1-





log

c c

+

1

(  1)

which exists and is always guaranteed to be positive, but has a nonconstant elasticity in c as consumption grows (holding c constant).
The second possibility is to let agents compare utility of consumption c while alive to some benchmark level of consumption c (possibly dependent on the date t), while alive, and otherwise assign zero utility,

q(c)

=

c1- 1

- -

c1- 

(47)

so that the total utility for old agents is given by

q

c 

=

c 

1- - c1-

1-





log

c c

(  1)

19

which exists and has a constant elasticitiy as c grows, but may no longer be

guaranteed to be always positive.

The third possibility is to restrict  < 1 for the original preference speci-

fication. At the expense of generality but at the gain of some simplification

for the analytics, we shall proceed with this restriction.

In either of these scenarios, the social planner effectively contemplates

insurance against the utility loss (or gain!), when dead. Put differently, if

there is a longevity shock, the old are happier simply due to living longer.

Hence, the social planner may seek to redistribute the gains in utility of the

old also to the young.

These insurance motives, while present in this paper, merit deeper philosph-

ical thought. For suppose some medical treatment could be found, which

extends the life of the old, but is rather costly. How much should it be worth

to society and who should pay for it? This depends rather crucially on the

additional utility generated due to being alive. For the third possibility, i.e.

our original specification and with  < 1, the additional utility generated is

bounded.

With  > 1 and the specification (46), the utility gain is unbounded,

as c  0, i.e., death can be made to be arbitrarily unattractive. In that

case, the cost limit ultimately is the entire GDP. To see this, suppose, total

average consumption of the old is given by c = c(), reflecting the cost of

improving longevity and the opportunity costs of transferring consumption

from the young to the old. The first-order condition with respect to  is

given by

0=

c() 

1-
- c1- 1-

-

c() 

1-
(1 - c)

(48)

where

c

=

c() c()

For any value c()/ > 0 and c, there is some c > 0, so that this derivative is positive, i.e., unless one obtains direction observations on choices involving the length of life, there is always some specification for the "fear of death", parameterized by c, which would justify additional spending on life-prolonging measures, no matter how costly.
Ultimately, from an economic perspective, this raises the need for measuring the aversion of agents against death in data, and using it to calibrate

20

these preferences. There are a number of activities, where agents clearly trade off the risk of dying against some utility-enhancing activity. For example, driving cars at a higher speed entails a higher risk of dying, and smoking causes people to die at an earlier age. By carefully measuring the utility gain (and measuring marginal changes, e.g. due to the change in the price for cigarettes or due to higher safety of cars), one may be able to calculate an economic value for death. This provides appropriates limits for the amount of resources which should be spent on extending lifes. The difficult discussions, when economic reasoning of this sort combined with ethic and moral judgements provide guidelines for the share of GDP to be spent on health care or, more drastically, turning off life-support measures for a terminally ill patient has only begun, and will surely intensify in the future, as the technological possibilities advance, see e.g. Murphy and Topel (2002) or Hall and Jones (2004).
3.3.2 Optimal risk sharing
Proposition 3 [Risk-Sharing with Epstein-Zin preferences.] With the preferences given by (42) and (44) and up to a first-order approximation in the log-deviations around a chosen benchmark, optimal intergenerational risk sharing implies

( - )at + ct,y - (1 - )v,tnt = ( - )at-1 + dt + (ct,o -  t),

Proof: Note first, that for any function f (x) = x, we have f =  and µf = 1 - . Leaving away the time subscript t except for µuc,n,t, u,n,t and

Substitute into equation (31). ∑

Note that we assume  < 1, as discussed in section 3.3.1. Thus, leisure and first-period consumption are complements and µu,nc,t < 0.
To provide some intution for the risk sharing condition, it may be useful to consider the following six special cases.
1. Assume: no Epstein-Zin, constant labor. Result: Perfect correlation of per-period consumption,
ct,y = ct,o -  t

2. Assume: additionally, endogenous labor. Result: Since  < 1, i.e., since leisure and consumption of the young are complements. leisure moves in the same direction as consumption of the young relative to per-period consumption of the old. To see this, rewrite

The intuition was discussed subsequent to proposition 2.

3. Assume: the old are risk-averse,  > , while there is no additional life risk aversion,  =  > 0. Benchmark uses information up to t - 1. Result: The old bear less of the risk. Longevity enters separately from old-age consumption.

4. Assume: the old are risk-averse,  > 0. The young are risk neutral,  =  = 0. Assume constant labor. Result: The young bear all the risk, 0 = ct,o - Et-1[ct,o]
5. Assume: infinite elasticity of intertemporal substitution,  = 0, constant labor, equal risk aversion of young and old,  =  > 0. Evaluate risk sharing based on information up to t - 1. Result: the life-time consumption of young reacts as much as consumption of old,
tct,y + (1 - t)Et[ct+1,o] = ct,o - Et-1[ct,o]

6. Assume: infinite elasticity of intertemporal substitution, no risk aversion of the old  =  = 0, constant labor, but risk aversion of young,  > 0, Evaluate the risk sharing condition based on information up to and including t - 1. Result: The old bear all the risk,
0 = tct,y + (1 - t)Et[ct+1,o]

The parameter  is most sensibly interpreted as life risk aversion. Suppose ct,o = Et-1[ct,o], i.e., old-age consumption changes are predictable when these agents are young, and suppose that  t  0. Then, the right-hand side of equation (49) can be written as
( - )t-1 (ct-1,y + v,tnt-1) + (( - )(1 - t-1) + ) ct,o.

23

The relevant scaling parameter on the rate of change for consumption of the

old ct,o is given by a combination of the curvature parameter  of the utility

of the young and life risk aversion . The curvature parameter of the young

comes in because, with a foreseeable shock, the intertemporal elasticity of

substitution between the two periods of life rather than the post-birth old-

age risk aversion  matters.

If relative consumption changes are the same, cs,o = cs-1,y, for s = t and s = t - 1, and if labor stays constant, nt = nt-1 = 0. then as = cs,y = cs+1,o for s = t and s = t - 1. and the risk-sharing condition (49) for
a foreseeable shock becomes

ct,y = ct,o.

(52)

as in (34). I.e., young and old should share consumption risk equally (in proportion to their benchmark level), when faced with a foreseeable shock. Their relevant risk aversion is now the life risk aversion , which is the same for both generations.
With unanticipated changes, by contrast, i.e. if Et-1[ct,o] = ct,y = 0, and assuming fixed employment and longevity, as well as ct,y = Et[ct+1,o], the risk-sharing condition (49) becomes

ct,y = ct,o.

(53)

Whereas old-age risk aversion  is relevant for consumption of the old in this case, life risk aversion  applies to the young. Indeed, in contrast to the young who can change all the arguments of their utility function, the old can adjust only their old-age consumption in response to an unanticipated shock. Eqation (53) is a version of one of the results announced in the introduction: the old bear a proportionally larger share of the consumptions risk, iff their risk-aversion is lower than the corresponding life risk aversion. In section ?? we shall see that this result continues to hold approximately for reasonable parameters, when preferences towards leisure are introduced.

4 Solving the social planners problem and parametric choices
Assume from now on that preferences are given by equation (44).

(54)

The exponent of the normalization variable differs here in order to achieve the appropriate scaling for these utility variables. Moreover note that we scale st by kt- rather than by kt--1 because that way, s~t-1 (rather than s~t-1 and k~t-1) turns out to be the only remaining endogenous state variable.
One can then solve for a steady state in these detrended variables as well calculate the dynamics around this steady state using loglinearization. The details are available in the appendix. Here we shall highlight only some key results.

4.1 Parametric choices
To explicitely calculate the steady state and provide quantitative results, we introduce a number of parametric assumptions regarding preferences, technologies and shocks.

25

For preferences regarding leisure, we assume specifically, that

4.3 The dynamics

After detrending with kt-1, the model no longer contains a state variable, except
s~t = stkt-.
This variable arises solely from the intertemporal optimization of the social planner, and disappears if e.g.  = , i.e., if life-time risk aversion equals the inverse of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution. One can think of s~t as representing a utility promise to future generations, or as a device which allows the social planner to share a risk across many generations, if there is additional life-time risk aversion.
Using loglinearization and assuming a recursive law of motion, in which s^t-1 is the only state variable, one can show that the dynamics can be reduced to solving a polynomial of third degree,

0 = s + s,ss,s + s,sss2,s + s,sss3s,s

(63)

28

for some coefficients s, s,s, s,ss and s,sss. The explicit calculations can be found in appendix A.5.
Equation (63) generally has three roots, s,s,i, i = 1, 2, 3, and for which closed-form solutions are available. If only one of these roots is stable, i.e. less than one in absolute value, then this is the root we use. If more than one stable root exists, then an additional state variable is needed as generally would be necessary to solve the system. If there are no stable roots, the system is explosive and our baseline assumption that there is a stationary solution to the social planners problem in the detrended variables unjustified.
When computing results below, we use the "toolkit" implementation, see Uhlig (1999), and allow for up to five rather than one endogenous state variable mostly for accounting reasons, see the appendix.

5 Decentralization and generational accounting

The solution of the social planner can be implemented in a decentralized economy using lump sum taxes and transfers on young and old agents and possibly a return subsidy to old agents, when privately holding capital in order to equate the social and the private rate of return.
We assume that production takes place by a competitive sector of firms, renting capital and hiring labor from competitive households, and experiencing an externality in production. More precisely, assume that production by firm j is given by

Yt,j = AtKt-1,j f

Zt

Kt-1 t

Nt,j Kt-1,j

(64)

where Nt,j is the amount of labor hired by firm j and Kt-1,j is the amount

of capital rented by firm j. The term

Kt-1 t

is an externality, enhancing

labor productivity in proportion to the capital available per young person.

Assuming that firms hire workers at their marginal product and rent capital

at its marginal product on competitive markets, one can easily show that

the capital-labor ratio across all firms is the same, and that the aggregrate

production function becomes (7).

29

The private rate of return to investing in capital is given by

Rtpriv = Rtsoc - Atf (Ztnt)Ztnt

(65)

where we recall the social rate of return from equation (24) as Rtsoc = Atf (Ztnt) + 1 - t.

(66)

Thus, the private rate of return is diminished by the externality in accumu-

lating capital, which is measured by the total wage payments per unit of

capital,

Atf (Ztnt)Ztnt

=

wttnt Kt-1

=

wttnt kt-1

Note that wages are given by (21),i.e.

wt

=

Atkt-1f

(Ztnt)

Zt t

.

(67)

We assume that the budget constraint of the individual household is given by

ct,y + st + t,y = wtnt ct+1,o + t+1,o = (1 + t+1)Rtp+r1ivst

(68) (69)

where st is private savings at date t, t,y is a lump sum tax when young, t+1,o is a lump-sum tax, when old, and t+1 is a return subsidy.
We shall focus on two extreme scenarios. In the first scenario - call it the case of "private capital" - all capital is held privately and the government budget balances period by period,

st = kt

Define the tax share

t,priv

=

t,y wtnt

=1-

ct,y wtnt

-

kt wtnt

(70)

in order to express the magnitude of the lump-sum taxes more intuitively in proportion of the wage earnings of the young. One may want to view

30

the average value of this share as reflecting the desire of the social planner towards redistribution, while its fluctuations may be viewed as fluctuating insurance payments of the young to the old in response to realizations of macroeconomic risks.
In this scenario, it is necessary to subsidize the returns to capital in proportion to capital held by the individual agent, so that the total proportional subsidy amounts to giving the entire production including the capital stock net of depreciation to the capital-holding old agents, and in turn lump-sum taxing the old agents so that the government budget constraint balances,

t+1,o

=

Rts+o1c Rtp+r1iv

-

1

=

wt+1t+1nt+1 Rtp+r1ivkt

t+1,o = t+1,oRtp+r1ivkt - t+1t+1,y

= t+1(ct+1,y + kt+1)

One interpretation of this last equation is that the generational account balances, i.e. the generational account of the old equals minus the generational account of the young.
In the second scenario - call it the case of "public capital" - all capital is held by pension funds,
st = 0

Thus, the lump sum taxes to be paid by the young are payments to pension funds, which in turn finance old-age consumption. Note that this is a mixture of a pay-as-you-go system and a fully funded system. In that case, the payments by the young to the pension system are

t,pub

=

t,y wtnt

=1-

ct,y wtnt

(71)

We examine both. A "defined benefit" system can be viewed as a system, where the old do
not bear any of the risk (except perhaps longevity) whereas the old bear the entire risk of random returns in a "defined contribution" system. The analysis here instead considers the degree of optimal risk sharing between

31

young and old. The relationship between the solution to the social planners problem, as investigated here, and these more specific "real world" pension system shall be investigated in future research.
6 Quantitative Results
This section explores the quantitative properties of the model and numerically calculates the reaction of the various quantities to the relevant shocks. We use a "hat" on variables to denote the logarithmic deviation from the expected balanced growth path with s~t constant, see appendix A.4.8 for details.
6.1 Benchmark parameterization
As a benchmark parameterization, pick  =  = 0.4,  = 1,  = 0.5, Ø = 1 and  =  = 2. Set  = .5,  = 1/3, Ø = 1, Ø = 1, ZØ = 1 and let ZØ such that there is no growth in steady state, kØ = 1, requiring AØ = 2.825.
The resulting benchmark equilibrium has nØ = 0.831, cØy/yØ = 0.27, cØo/cØy = 1.22, RØ = 2.5, which corresponds to an annualized interest rate of 3.1%, assuming that one period lasts 30 years.
The lump sum taxes relative to the wage bill of the young is priv = -0.65%, i.e. in the case of privately held capital, the young agent would receive a fairly neglible subsidy (financed out of a lump-sum tax on the "rich old", who also finance their own return subsidy). The lump-sum payment to the pension fund in case of "publicly held capital" is pub = 59%, i.e. the young would pay somewhat more than half of his wage earnings into the fund.
For the exogenous parameters, we have assumed them to be iid, except for longevity t, which we assume to be a random walk. For the latter, it seems plausible that medical progress is permanent. For the other variables, note that e.g. TFP has a unit root due to the endogenous growth feature of our model, even though the TFP parameter At (and the labor productivity parameter Zt) is iid. Also, note that t denotes population growth, so that the log of population follows a random walk, if t is iid.

6.2 Comparative statics
The sensitivity of these results to three parameters, ,  and  =  can be seen in table 3. The last row in that table lists the feedback coefficient on the endogenous state s^t for the dynamic solution. While the first three columns have risk aversion of young and old the same, the last three columns set the life risk aversion to the intertemporal elasticity of substitution of the young, i.e., do not modify the ex-post utility of the young by a further risk-transformation so that the social intertemporal substitution elasticity coincides with the corresponding private elasticity. Note that the last three columns are fairly similar to the first three columns except for this feedback coefficient and a substantial change for priv in case of no depreciation.
Table 3 shows which factors determine optimal intergenerational distribution. In particular, the sign of the variable Øpriv indicates to what extent the optimal pension system is funded. A positive value for Øpriv indicates that the pension system is in part pay-as-you-go financed. In that case, the generational account for the young is negative (and for the old is positive) in the absence of shocks. There is systematic redistribution from the young to the old.
In the benchmark calculation, systematic redistribution is limited. The benchmark social optimum thus calls for a small amount of systematic redistribution from the old to the young in the decentralized economy.
The second column of Table 3 shows that the systematic redistribution towards the young is increased if the current old become richer compared to the young on account of a lower depreciation rate (more capital income compared to labor income). Note also that the growth rate kØ increases. The higher return on capital (as a result of lower depreciation rate) allows for a higher growth rate. The young save more because of two reasons: a higher return (substitution effect) and higher income (since the old transfer more income to the young). Another way of interpreting the increased systematic redistribution from the old to the young (an inverse PAYG system) is that the pension system is overfunded. Intuitively, funding increases because the return on capital increases and the older generation becomes richer.
A comparison of the second and fifth column of table 3 shows that the additional systematic redistribution in favor of the young due to a lower depreciation rate becomes more substantial if ex-ante risk aversion  decreases. The reason is that there is a lower social preference for similar utility levels
33

across generations. Hence, making the future generations better off compared to the current generations (as a result of higher return on capital and thus growth) becomes more attractive and systematic redistribution from the old to the young is increased further. The old keep less of their additional income as a result of higher capital income due to a lower depreciation rate.
Obviously, this systematic redistribution between young and old would be heavily affected by letting the discount factor of the social planner  and the discount factor of the private agent  differ. As an alternative possibility for comparing steady states, one could calibrate  and  in such a way that laissez faire in intergenerational distribution is optimal in the absence of shocks, i.e. priv = 0. Then, the decentralized economy with private capital yields the correct intergenerational distribution, assuming that the old pay their own investment subsidy.
6.3 Endogenous dynamics
In table 3 and focussing on the last low in the last three columns, note that there is no feedback on the endogenous state (i.e. s,s), if the lifetime risk aversion  equals the intertemporal elasticity of substitution , i.e., if the social intertemporal substitution elasticity coincides with the private intertemporal substitution elasticity.
We are particularly interested in exploring the risk-sharing features as the risk aversion of the old, , is varied vis-a-vis the life risk aversion of the young, . Figure 7 shows the dependence of the feedback coefficient s,s as these two risk-aversion parameters  and  are varied between  = 0.5 and the value 4 at the upper end. As one can see, the endogenous dynamics depends practically entirely on  alone within this two-dimensional variation.
The impact of the state variable s,s is determined by the divergence between  and  and the importance of endogenous labor supply (i.e. the size of ; if  = 1, labor supply is exogenous). The more difficult it becomes to substitute across generations compared to intertemporal substitution within generations as measured , the more shocks are spread out across various generations as indicated by a larger feedback impact of the state variable.
Shifting risks between the old and the young when the shocks hit is sufficient if  = . In that case, the young affect their saving behavior in the socially optimal way to redistribute between generations and the government does not have to perform any additional redistribution next period.
34

6.4 Intergenerational risk sharing

Table 4 contains the corresponding feedback coefficients to three shocks: total factor productivity Z, longevity  and population growth . There, growth,∑ refers to the absolute change in the growth rate (rather than relative to the growth factor kØ). If e.g. growth,Z = 1.28, then this means that the capital stock will grow by an additional 1.28%, if TFP increases by 1%. Likewise, ,priv,Z = -0.35 says that the lump sum tax to be paid in case of privately held capital is lowered by 0.35% of the current wage bill, in case TFP increases by 1%.
To shed light on risk sharing, we have included three more quantities. First and second, we have calculated the reaction coefficient for the total tax collection from the young, normalized by the unchanged wage earnings, each for the case of private as well as public capital. In the case of private capital, this is

priv,tot

=

tt,y ØwØnØ

=

t (wtnt - ct,y - kt) ØwØnØ

(72)

and its percent change is given by

^priv,tot = ^priv + Øpriv(n^ + w^ + ^)

Note that this coincides with the reaction coefficient for ^priv, if Ø = 0. Likewise,

pub,tot

=

t (wtnt - ct,y) ØwØnØ

(73)

with

^pub,tot = ^pub + Øpub(n^ + w^ + ^)

The total priv,tot is the total contribution of the young to a pension system, where capital is held privately. In particular, if it is identical to zero and unaffected by shocks, then this means that the young do not contribute to insuring the old, and that the old have to bear the entire risk to the returns of their capital alone. Put differently, this number indicates additional intergenerational risk sharing compared to a decentralized equilibrium in which

35

the old can save only through capital market (and the old finance their own investment subsidy). priv indicates how the government can in fact create new assets to allow trade of risks between generations.
Third, we have also calculated the change in consumption of the old relative to the total change in consumption, i.e., the feedback coefficient for the (loglinearized) quantity

ratt

=

co,t ctot,t

=

co,t co,t + tcy,t

(74)

In log-deviations,

r^att

=

1

1

+

cØo ØcØy

(c^o,t

- c^y,t - ^t)

(75)

If this quantity is unchanged, i.e., if the feedback is zero, then this means

that consumption of the old increases in proportion with overall consumption resources. Generally, r^at > 0 in one of three cases. It happens, if both

consumptions rise, but ct,o rises relatively more. It happens, if both consumptions fall, but ct,o falls relatively less. Finally, it happens if ct,o rises and ct,y falls. These three cases ought to be kept in mind when evaluating the results.

The dependence of the shock-reaction of these three quantities as well

as labor supply on the two risk aversion parameters  and  are shown in

figures 8 to 11, both as a three-dimensional mesh as well as a two-dimensional

contour plot.

For the impulse responses, we have used the benchmark parameterization,

except for setting  = 1 rather than  = 2. This does not change the steady

state, but makes for a differential reaction of consumption of the young vis-a-

vis consumption of the old, see the discussion below, and therefore for more

differentiated impulse response figures. They are shown in figures 1 to 6.

The upper left corner shows the response of normalized consumption of the

young, old and the capital stock, whereas the lower left corner provides the

corresponding "level" variables, i.e. without dividing by aggregate capital.

The upper right corner shows the responses of labor, output (normalized)

and growth while the lower right corner shows the responses of the lump-

sum taxes to be paid by the young, expressed in percent of the steady state

wage bill. Likewise, the response of depreciation is expressed in percent of

the capital stock, not in percent of the steady state depreciation rate (which

36

is assumed to be zero, anyways). All figures also show the response of the "shocked" variable, i.e. longevity, TFP, labor productivity, population and depreciation as well as the response of the state variable s, as one proceeds from figure 1 to 6.
The lower-left corner pictures show the persistence effect of shocks, due to the endogenous growth feature of the model. However, the effects are usually not an instantaneous adjustment to some new level, but the response is "smeared out" over a few generations, due to the endogenous dynamics of the state variable st. The endogenous dynamics itself is plotted in figure 6.
The responses to a shock in TFP are practically the same (up to scaling) to a shock to labor productivity, because we have essentially assumed a CobbDouglas production function. For the benchmark calibration and in reaction, the consumption of the young rises somewhat more than the consumption of the old, which can also be seen by a reduction the young are supposed to make to the pension system, i.e. a lowering of their lump-sum taxes. In response to a shock to population growth, consumption falls: essentially, the young now have to make-do with less capital-per-capita than before. Due to the endogenous growth formulation of the model, this effect persists.
6.5 Technology shocks
In the simplest risk sharing case, consumption of the young and old rise by the same percentage, see the first case of the interpretation of the general risksharing equation and equation (34). There, this case is obtained if there is no endogenous labor supply and risk-aversion and intertemporal substitution are assumed to be the same for the young and the old, and where there are no life risks. The case of equal risk sharing can arise in the full version of the model as well. Indeed, for the case of a technology shock Z and for the case that  = , and with full depreciation Ø = 1, consumption of the young as well as the old rises one-for-one with productivity, and there is no shift in old-age consumption relative to total consumption, as the first block of table 4 shows. The tax payments both for the case of private capital as well as public capital do not react as both labor income (collected by the young) and capital income (collected by the old) rise proportionally with productivity. There is a reaction of the total tax collection from the young in case of publicly held capital simply because their wages rise, and because the initial tax rate in case of publicly held capital is not zero.
37

Whether or not the consumption of the old or the consumption of the young reacts more strongly depends on the ratio between life risk aversion versus risk-aversion when old. The upper-left corner of the contour plot figure 9 shows a straight line of no reaction in the old-consumption-to-totalconsumption-ratio for the case  = . If  is larger than , i.e., if the old are relatively more risk averse, then the consumption of the old reacts less strongly, and most of the risk is thus born by the young. Indeed, the young will then consume more goods and consume more leisure (as the income effect dominates the substitution effect), which is why labor declines in response, see the upper-right corner of the same contour plot.
To implement the higher sensitivity of the consumption of the young, when the risk-aversion of the young is relatively low, actually requires a additional subsidy from the old to the young in the case of privately held capital or a lower total tax payment in the case of publicly held capital if a positive production shock materializes. This is paid out of the increased return to capital in the hands of the old, as e.g. the upper-left hand corner of figure 10 shows. It is easier to see the intuition for a case of a less-thanexpected growth in technology, resulting in lower capital and labor income. In that case, the young have to make up for the low returns on equity by working harder and giving up some of their wage income. In other words, the young bear most of the productivity risk by transferring additional resources to the old in bad times and by collecting additional resources from the old in bad times. Risks are traded in just the opposite way if the old are relatively less risk averse.
The reaction of total consumption is modified by the rate of depreciation: with only partial depreciation, as in the second and fifth column of table 4, some consumption smoothing is possible out of capital so production shocks result in less volatile consumption. At the same time, a positive production results in less additional growth (compared to a full one-percent advantage in growth due to the additional one-percent growth in TFP).
6.6 Population growth shocks
Note that the consumption of the young and the old always move in the same direction for all shocks, as can be seen both from the impulse responses as well as table 4. This is a key difference between optimal risk sharing and decentralized pension systems. For example, in the absence of insurance,
38

a population growth shock will enhance the return to capital, due to the abundance of labor. At the same time, the shock induces lower wages, lower consumption of the young, and higher consumption of the old. This is not the case with optimal risk sharing: both the consumption of the young and the old decrease.
The response of old versus young consumption depends again on the relationship between old-age risk aversion versus life risk aversion. The young need to be actually slightly more risk averse for the relative consumption changes of the old and young to be the same, see the first three columns and the rows for co and ctot in table 4.
Labor of the young declines with the population shock: this should be an unsurprising consequence of the substitution effect, as the marginal product of labor falls. Note, however, how the income effect (which may lead young agents to work harder) is offset here due to the risk-sharing arrangement with the currently old.
Note also that the difference between the tax rate priv, when not accounting for the changes in wages, population and labor, and the total tax collection priv,tot is fairly minor in all cases, i.e., even if the steady state values for these tax rates are nonzero. The same holds true for the case of publicly held capital. This result comes about, because the additional population growth is almost nearly completely offset by the decline in wages and the change in hours.
6.7 Shocks to Longevity
The reaction to a longevity-shock shows a number of interesting and possibly counterintuitive features. If the young are sufficiently risk-neutral, they are asked to work harder individually, in order to somehow generate additional resources. However, as table 4 shows, these resources do not go to the currently old - total consumption for the currently old (and therefore, certainly per-period consumption of the currently old) actually falls! Instead, because the longevity shock is persistent, the additional resources are planted into higher capital for the future, and growth picks up. I.e., the same generation that now is asked to work harder is also the first generation that gets to enjoy the fruits of this additional labor in the form of higher old-age consumption, see also the impulse response in figure 1. The drop in (total) consumption for the currently old is not quite as dramatic as the drop in consumption of
39

the currently young, and thus, consumption is actually shifted in their favor in terms of their share of total consumption.
The intuition for the additional redistribution in favor of future generations in response to increased longevity is as follows. Longer longevity raises the marginal utility of old-age consumption and therefore increases the return on private saving. The higher implicit return on saving makes it more attractive to redistribute towards future generations, especially if the social intertemporal substitution elasticity 1/ is large. The comparison between the first three columns and the last three columns of Table 4 shows indeed that the growth response to longevity is larger if  is smaller. We find a larger growth response to an increase in longevity than Bohn (2003) for two reasons. First of all, our calibration implies a relatively large intertemporal substitution elasticity. Second, in view of the endogenous growth feature of our model, the marginal product of capital does not decline with capital accumulation. Hence, shifting resources over time and between generations can be attractive in response to shocks.
Increased longevity raises not only saving but also work effort. Indeed, the higher marginal utility of consumption on account of a longer expected life makes work more attractive. Note also that the difference between the tax rate priv, when not accounting for the changes in wages, population and labor, and the total tax collection priv,tot is fairly substantial, if the steady state values for the tax rates are nonzero, most notably in the fifth column of table 4. The same holds true for the case of publicly held capital. This result comes about, because the fairly change in labor supply by the young triggers additional tax collections in that scenario.
7 Conclusions
We have developed a stochastic endogenous growth with overlapping generations to explore optimal intergenerational risk sharing and redistribution to explore how the pension system can implement optimal intergenerational risk sharing and redistribution between old, young and future generations. Our endogenous growth model is fairly tractable, despite featuring endogenous labor supply, a number of different shocks and nonseparable preferences. Depending on risk aversion of the various generations, the pension system can help to diversify the financial-market risks faced by older generations
40

and the labor-market and human-capital risks faced by younger generations. A number of interesting insights emerge from the quantitative exploration
of the model, as discussed in detail in section 6: Neither a defined benefit system or a defined contribution system is typically optimal from a social planners perspective. In particular, per capita consumption of the young and the old always move in the same direction, even for positive population growth shocks. This result is in contrast to the response of a fully-funded decentralized system to such shocks: there, the old would receive higher percapita consumption (due to the increase in return to capital), while the young would receive lower per-capita consumption (due to decreasing marginal returns in labor from the larger working population). In contrast to what a defined benefit system offers, higher life-expectancy optimally requires old agents to get by with less resources. Indeed, persistent increases in longevity will lead to lower total consumption of the old (and thus certainly lower perperiod consumption of the old) and the young as well as higher work effort of the young. The additional resources are used to increase growth and future output, resulting in higher consumption of future generations.
In future work, we plan to use the model to explore how the intergenerational risk sharing properties of the pension system affect the equity premium. In particular, in a laissez fair equilibrium without intergenerational risk sharing, the equity premium may be quite high as the risk-averse retired generations cannot share capital income risk with other generations. In the presence of a defined-benefit pension system, however, the old can shed some of this risk to younger generations. In effect, the young issue bonds to the older generations and invest the proceeds in the capital market. In this way, the young have become residual claimants of the pension funds and thus share in the investment risk. By thus spreading investment risk more widely over the population and allowing the young to in effect borrow against their human capital to invest in the stock market (see Constantinides, Donaldson and Mehra (2002)), the equity premium can fall (and the risk-free rate can rise) in general equilibrium. Indeed, defined-benefit pension funds may help individuals to implement an optimal life investment plan, which typically involves individuals to heavily borrow in the beginning of their life to invest in the stock market (see Bodie, Merton and Samuelson (1992), Davis, Kubler, and Willen (2002), Jagannathan, and Kocherlakota (1996), and Teulings and de Vries (2006)). These pension plans thus in effect allow the young to participate in the stock market. If households can choose between low-risk
41

(and low-return) and high-risk (and high-return) investments, better intergenerational risk sharing can boost growth by maintaining incentives for risk taking in high-return investments (see Obstfeld (1994) in the context of international risk sharing). At the same time, however, better risk sharing may decrease precautionary saving, thereby reducing capital accumulation and growth. We plan to estimate the potential effects of the pension system in calibrated models.
In allowing intergenerational risk sharing through government intervention, we have assumed that the young cannot participate in capital markets at all to share risks (before the uncertainty during their life time has unfolded). One interpretation is that human capital is not tradable and that the young therefore cannot borrow at all against their human capital to invest in financial capital (see also Constantinides, Donaldson and Mehra (2002)). In practice, however, the young may be able to participate in equity-market risk that materializes during their working career, either by borrowing, by investing all their saving in the risk-bearing capital, or by buying call options. Indeed, capital markets allow in principle for risk-sharing between overlapping generations, especially if the young can borrow. In this regard, our calculations, which assumed only two discrete periods of life, are likely to overstate the potential risk-sharing benefits from defined-benefit pension plans. In future work, we would like to explore how sensitive our results are with respect to alternative assumptions about the extent (including the frequency) which the young can participate in capital markets.
Our analysis has assumed that governments can implement optimal intergenerational risk sharing by committing future generations to a risk sharing contract. For the question of implementability, additional aspects seem crucial to us. First, government intervention may not only help to share market risks but also give rise to new risks. These additional political risks must be traded off against the possible gains in sharing market risks. Second, the government may face serious problems in committing future generations to an optimal complete risk-sharing contract. For one, in a democracy in which current generations have the voting power, the government faces a serious commitment problem; future generations can always opt out. For another, the government faces substantial fundamental uncertainty so that complete contracts are excessively costly. With substantial fundamental uncertainty, discretion rather than rules become optimal.
Optimal risk sharing is sensitive to the magnitude of ex-ante risk aver-
42

sion  versus ex-post risk aversion . The latter type of risk aversion may exceed ex-ante risk aversion in the presence of habit formation (see also Bohn (2003)). Habit formation, however, gives rise to new phenomena. Another explanation for high levels of risk aversion is 'standard-of-living' utility in which people are sensitive to their utility level compared to that of others. Exploring the sensitivity of our results to alternative specifications of preferences is an important subject for future research.
We have relied on numerical solutions. In some special cases, however, we can solve the model analytically. This may provide a useful benchmark for understanding the features of the optimal solution in other, more complicated cases. We plan to investigate the analytical solutions in the future.

Note that all these logarithmic derivatives are known as of t - 1 by as-

sumption. The time subscript therefore does not indicate "information", but

rather indicates the argument.

48

To derive the equations in proposition 2, one needs to take a first-order Taylor expansion in the logarithmic deviations. These calculations can often be performed rather speedily by combining several "rules", which are easily verified:

[Rule 1:] To take the Taylor expansion for a single variable, note xt = xØt exp xt  xØt(1 + x^t)

[Rule 2:] If zt = Axtyt, where A is some constant, and the same is true for the benchmark values, then
zt = xt + yt.

[Rule 3:] If zt = xt + yt and the same is true for the benchmark values, then zØtzt = xØtxt + yØtyt.

[Rule 4:] Suppose, some variable zt satisfies zt = f (xt) as well as zØt = f (xØt). Then, zt = f xt.
where f is the logarithmic derivative of f (∑) at xØt,

f

=

f (xØt)xØt f (xØt)

The extension to two variables, zt = f (xt, yt) is

zt = f,xxt + f,yyt,

where

f,x

=

fx(xØt, yØt)xØt f (xØt, yØt)

,

f,y

=

fy(xØt, yØt)yØt f (xØt, yØt)

.

Note furthermore, that

1. Taking logarithms of equation (79) delivers

zt + uc,t = zt-1 + dt + qt

Application of rule 4 to these items immediately delivers (84), i.e.

µz,tat + µuc,c,tct,y + µuc,n,tnt = µz,t-1at-1 + dt + µq,t (ct,o -  t)

(84)

2. To loglinearize (81), use rule 3 to obtain

at = tut + (1 - t)t. With rule 4, extended to two arguments, and applied to ut = u(c, n),
ut = u,c,tct,y + u,n,tnt.

Also with rule 4,

t = ,tet

Interchanging expectation and differentiation, rule 4 delivers

et = x,t+1 ((1 - q,t+1)Et[ t+1] + q,t+1Et[ct+1,o]) . Combining and exploiting (77), one obtains equation (33), i.e.

(85)

at = t (u,c,tct,y + u,n,tnt) +(1 - t)((1 - q,t+1)Et[ t+1] + q,t+1Et[ct+1,o]).

(86)

51

3. Taking logarithms of (83) delivers dt = t-1 + xt
For xt , rule 4 delivers xt = -µx,t ((1 - q,t) t + q,tct,o)
For t-1, repeated application of rule 4 delivers t-1 = -µx-1,t-1et = -µx-1,t-1Et-1 [x,t ((1 - q,t) t + q,tct,o)]
Combining and exploiting (78) delivers equation (33), i.e. dt = µx,t ((1 - q,t) ( t - Et-1[ t]) + q,t (ct,o - Et-1[ct,o]))

A.2 Scale Invariance and Balanced Growth
Scale invariance has a number of implications.

1. To save on notation, define ct,y = ct,y, ct,o = ct,o and wt = wt: these are part of the allocation  . Thus, equation (22) can be rewritten as

u,c,t u,n,t

=

- ct,y wtnt

(87)

Note that the right hand side - which can be interpreted as the income share spend on consumption of the young - does not depend on . Hence, the ratio of the two logarithmic derivatives u,c,t = u,c,t(ct,y, nt) and u,n,t = u,n,t(ct,y, nt) is independent of the argument ct,y.

2. Suppose that the income share spend on consumption of the young is

constant

ct,y wtnt



y ,

(88)

then

u,c,t = yu,n,t.

(89)

We note that this condition will hold along a balanced growth path, where indeed the income share should be constant.

52

3. Replace ct,y with ct,y in (22), and take the logarithmic derivative with respect to  to obtain

0

-µuc,c,t

µuc,n,t

+

1,

or

=

-µuc,c,t

+

µuc,n,t

u,c,t u,n,t

+

1

across all values c~t,y.

(90) (91)

4. Suppose additionally, that µuc,c,t is constant over time and   µuc,c,t. We can derive a semi-closed form for the utility function u(c, n), as is well-known from the literature, see e.g. King and Plosser (1989). We provide the derivation here for the sake of completeness. Consider first the case  = 1. Since µuc,c,t is the (negative) logarithmic derivative of uc with respect to c, this implies log-linearity for uc,

log uc(ct,y, nt) = (1 - ) log v(nt) -  log ct,y,

where the "constant" term (1 - ) log v(nt), may depend on nt (and seems to have been written in a rather complicated fashion, as this will turn out to be convenient below). Rewrite as

uc(ct,y, nt) = v(nt)1-c-t,y,

and integrate to obtain

u(ct,y, nt)

=

(v (nt )ct,y )1- 1-

+

(nt),

(92)

where (nt) is an additional constant, possibly depending on nt. Differentiating with respect to nt and comparing to (22) shows that (nt)   independent of nt as follows. Rewrite (22) for the allocation  as

wt

=

-

un (ct,y , uc (ct,y ,

nt) nt)

=

-

v(nt) v(nt)

ct,y

-

(nt) v (nt )1- (ct,y )-

.

53

Divide by  to see that the left hand side and the first term on the
right hand side do not depend on , whereas the last one does, unless either  = 1 or (nt) = 0. Since we assumed  = 1, (nt) must be a constant, independent of nt. The case  = 1 similarly yields

u(ct,y, nt) = log ct,y + v(nt).

(93)

5. Consider a nonstochastic case. Equation (26) reads

uc(ct,y, nt) =  x-1 

x

t+1q

ct+1,o t+1

x t+1q

ct+1,o t+1

q

ct+1,o t+1

Rt+1.

(94)

Take the logarithmic derivative with respect to  and exploit (78) to

find

µuc,c,t = µq,t+1

(95)

6. Again for the nonstochastic case, the constant share condition ~t = t can be rewritten as

1 t

-

1

u(ct,y, nt) = q(ct+1,o)

where t does not depend on . Taking the logarithmic derivative with respect to , we establish

u,c,t = q,t+1

(96)

A.3 The equity premium
To relate the risk-aversion parameters to observables, one possibility is that observed allocations are (nearly) optimal as far as intergenerational risk sharing is concerned, and to calibrate the risk-aversion parameters to observed market prices of risk. In our context, this means to observe market prices of risk from young agents trading assets which pay off when they are old.
Given an allocation which solves the social planners problem, suppose that the social planer contemplates transferring resources between periods

54

using some asset a with return Rta+1. Since the allocation is already optimal, the social planner must wish not to execute this reallocation. Hence, it has
to be the case that the asset pricing condition ( 26) not only holds for Rt+1, but for the return Rta+1 as well, which might, of course, coincide with Rt+1. Recall the definition of the stochastic discount factor mt+1,

mt+1

=  x-1 

Et x

t+1q

ct+1,o t+1

x

t+1q

ct+1,o t+1

q ct+1,o t+1

The asset pricing equation (26) then implies

Et mt+1Rta+1 = Et [mt+1Rt+1] .

(97)

Decompose Rta+1, ct+1,o, t+1, ms,t+1 into their predicted part and surprise part,

log(Rta+1) = log(RØta+1) + Rta+1, log(ct+1,o) = log(cØt+1,o) + ct+1, log(t+1) = log(Ø t+1) +  t+1, log(mt+1) = log(mØ t+1) + m t+1,

with

0 = Et[Rta+1] = Et[ct+1] = Et[ t+1] = Et[m t+1]

We assume that the surprise parts are jointly normally distributed, conditional on information up to and including t. Denote the standard deviations by e.g. R,t+1 and m,t+1 and correlations denoted by e.g. m,R,t+1. Define the Sharpe ratio, defined as the difference of the log expected returns divided by the standard deviation of the log return,

log (Et[Rt+1]) - log Rtf

SRt =

R,t+1

.

(98)

Using a standard calculation, see Lettau and Uhlig (2002), one can show

that

SRt = -m,R,t+1m,t+1

(99)

55

It is easy to see that, up to a log-linear approximation,

m t+1 = -µx,t+1( t+1 + q,t+1(ct+1,o -  t+1)) - µq,t+1(ct+1,o -  t+1) = (µx,t+1(q,t+1 - 1) + µq,t+1) t+1 - (µx,t+1q,t+1 + µq,t+1)ct+1,o

Using the same calculation as for (99), one can then show that

SRt = -(µx,t+1(q,t+1 - 1) + µq,t+1),R,t+1,t+1 +(µx,t+1q,t+1 + µq,t+1)c,o,R,t+1c,o,t+1

(100)

For the specific functional form of subsection 3.3, we thus obtain

SRt

=

 1

- -

 

,R,t+1,t+1

+ c,o,R,t+1c,o,t+1

(101)

These equations are informative about measuring curvature parameters of the utility specification. In particular, we see that if there is no surprise longevity risk,  t+1  0, then the risk premium is proportional to the risk aversion parameter , the standard deviation c,o,t+1 of old-age consumption co,t+1 and the correlation c,o,R,t+1 of old-age consumption with the asset return.
In solving a social planners problem and in characterizing the speed of capital accumulation, the appropriate risk premium and thus, the appropriate "scarcity" of capital to generate the required average return, ought to be taken into account.

A.4 Solving the social planners problem
A.4.1 Collecting the equations

A.4.2 Normalization

To turn this into a stationary system, the growing variables need to be divided by the beginning-of-period capital level kt-1. Thus, let

except that we define

s~t  stkt-.

The exponent differs here in order to achieve the appropriate scaling for these utility variables. Moreover, we scale st by kt- rather than by kt--1 because that way, s~t-1 (rather than s~t-1 and k~t-1) turns out to be the only remaining endogenous state variable.

Rewrite the system as

Note that indeed the only endogenous state variable remaining is s~t-1.

A.4.3 Stochastic assumptions

To make further progress, we need some additional, tractable assumptions.

Let  t 

 At 

t

=

 

Zt

 

(103)

 

t

 

t

be the vector of exogenous parameters. We assume that a steady state Ø

exists and that

^t = log(t) - log(Ø)

follows an AR(1) process,

^t = N ^t-1 + t

(104)

for some 5 ◊ 5 matrix N with nonexplosive roots, where

59

 ,t 

 A,t 

t

is the vector of innovations for each exogenous parameter and

t  N (0, ).

A.4.4 Steady state
The steady state for the "tilde"-variables - which we shall now also use as our benchmark values - is given by the equations

yØ = AØf (ZØnØ),

cØyØ + cØo + kØØ = AØf (ZØnØ) + 1 - Ø,

where R2 -c denotes the conditional variance of log Rt+1 +  log(t+1) -  log(ct+1,o) and x2 is the conditional variance of  log t+1 + (1 - ) log ct+1,o.
We have included the risk terms in the intertemporal equations, thus
including a precautionary motive for saving. We implicitely assumed (as

60

remains to be shown in the log-linearized version), that the variances are constant over time. This will be justified below, when solving for the linear recursive law of motion for the loglinearized system, see subsection A.4.10.
Finally, define the argument share

A.4.5 Solving for the steady state

Labor supply (108) can be written as

wØnØ cØy

=

-v(nØ),

(115)

which says that the inverse of the share of wage income spent on consumption when young is tied to v(nØ). Labor demand (107) together with (105) implies

wØnØØ yØ

=

f (ZØnØ).

(116)

The labor share in production is thus closely relared to the productivityweighted labor input ZØnØ. Combining equations (115) and (116), one can

eliminate the wage rate wØ

ØcØy yØ

=

f (ZØnØ) -v(nØ)

.

(117)

We also assume that variances and covariances are known: the underlying

fixed point problem will be discussed below. Equation (113) implies

xØ = 1kØcØo,

(118)

where

1 = exp

x2/2 1-

Ø

 1-

.

61

The asset pricing equation (110), which can be viewed as describing optimal saving, can be rewritten with (118) as

cØy-v(nØ)1- = 2cØ-o kØ-RØ,

(119)

where

2 = 1- exp R2 -c/2

=

Ø  exp

 1

- -

 

x2/2

exp R2 -c/2 .

The risk-sharing condition (111) together with the definitions (114) and

(118) implies

cØ-y v(nØ)1- =

 

1-

Ø 

cØo- kØ- ,

(120)

which can be rewritten as

cØo ØcØy

=

3kØ

(121)

where

1

3

=

Ø 



1

=

Ø exp

- (1 - 

)

x2/2

.

While (119) arises from an intertemporal savings decision, equation (120) arises from the risk-sharing condition. The difference between these two equations thus partially stems from the different weights given to an agent currently alive or alive in the future due to population growth and social planner discounting. Equations (119) and (120) with (109) together imply

kØ = 4RØ = 4 AØf (ZØnØ) + 1 - Ø ,

(122)

where

4

=

2  1 - 

=  exp

R2 -c/2

,

62

which sheds light on the relationship between growth of the economy kØ and

required labor nØ versus the discount factor of the social planner  and a term exp(R2 -c) related to the risk premium. Note also, that

1

3

=

1 Ø

2 4


.

The right-hand side of (106) equals RØ. Use (105) to rewrite (106) as

ØcØy yØ

1 + cØo ØcØy

=

1

+

1 - Ø - ØkØ AØf (ZØnØ)

.

(123)

Combining

kØ = 4RØ = 4 AØf (ZØnØ) + 1 - Ø .

Substituting

the

into

obtains

v(nØ)

-

-1

 v(nØ) 

1 - Ø - Ø =1+

4 AØf (ZØnØ) + 1 - Ø AØf (ZØnØ)

.(128)

This is a single and nonlinear equation in nØ. Solving it requires a specification for v(∑) and f (∑). A solution may perhaps be given in special cases, but numerical methods must be used generally. There may be multiple solutions nØ > 0, indicating a multiplicity of steady states. Given a solution to this equation, all other steady state variables can then be calculated.

A.4.6 A parameterization

We shall assume that

v (n)

=

µv (n)

=

n -

n

.

Thus, (115) can be rewritten as

wØ(1 - cØy

nØ)

=

1 - .

(129)

The "expenditure ratio" of leisure over consumption when young is thus given by 1 - .
Further, we assume that

f (x) =

Either directly or per   1, one then gets

A.4.7 A special case

For the special case  = 1, replace in equation (125) to get

Given a value of nØ, equation (127) shows that the growth factor kØ of

the economy and the level of total factor productivity AØ are closely related.

Varying the latter will not affect nØ under full depreciation in case  =   1, as shown above. Thus, to obtain an economy with a growth factor kØ, we can

set

AØ

=

kØ (ZØnØ)

,

where we once again ignore the variance and risk premium terms. These calculations also help in a somewhat more general case. For sup-
pose alternatively, that Ø = 1, but that  =  = 1. Use the solution nØ of equation (135), but without imposing  = 1 for calculating 5, i.e. using (136) to "back out" the level parameter vØ in the disutility of the young

This may be useful in order to investigate local comparative statics around a known steady state or to find an initial point for numerically calculating the steady state.

A.4.8 Loglinearization
We now use hats on variables to denote the loglinearization of the detrended variables around the detrended steady state, e.g.

c^t,y = log(c~t,y) - log(cØt,y).

Furthermore and from here onwards and in slight abuse of notation, let f and
v be the logarithmic derivatives of f (∑) and v(∑), and µf and µv the (negative) elasticity of f (∑) and v(∑), all evaluated at steady-state employment nØ for v(∑) resp. ZØnØ for f (∑). The loglinearization is given by

y^t = A^t + f (Z^t + n^t), cØyØ(c^t,y + ^t) + cØoc^t,o + kØØ(k^t + ^t) = yØ(A^t + f (Z^t + n^t)) - Ø^t,
w^t = A^t - µf Z^t + n^t + Z^t - ^t,

w^t - c^t,y = -(µv + v)n^t, RØR^t = yØ(A^t + f (Z^t + n^t)) - Ø^t,
-c^t,y + (1 - )vn^t = -k^t + Et ^ t+1 - c^t+1,o + R^t+1 ,

A.4.9 Preparation for MATLAB implementation

In order to implement this system of equations, it is more convenient to use

^t = Ø^t - since this is already in percent anyways and to handle Ø = 0 as

limit - as well as a^t =

a^t 1-

. Write the system as

0 = A^t + f (Z^t + n^t) - y^t, 0 = RØR^t - cØyØ(c^t,y + ^t) - cØoc^t,o - kØØ(k^t + ^t),
0 = A^t - µf Z^t + n^t + Z^t - ^t - w^t,

0 = -(µv + v)n^t - w^t + c^t,y, 0 = yØy^t - ^t - RØR^t, 0 = ( - )a^t + c^t,y - (1 - )vn^t

to capture the movements in the ratios of lump sum taxes to wage earnings to
be paid by the young, expressed in percent (rather than in percent deviation
from the steady state of this ratio). As state variables we choose s^t, c^t,y, c^t,o, a^t and k. The first three come
in due to the insights from some analytic calculations towards deriving the
law of motion in closed form, available as a technical appendix in a working
paper version, and are to having three rather than one equation containing expectations. The variable a^t has been added in order to avoid potential difficulties of a purely algebraic nature in the special case  = . Finally,
k has been added as a state to recalculate the impulse responses for the
non-normalized variables, if so desired.

A.4.10 The recursive law of motion We wish to solve for the linear recursive law of motion,

s^t = s,ss^t-1 + s, t n^t = n,ss^t-1 + n, t c^t,y = cy,ss^t-1 + cy, t c^t,o = co,ss^t-1 + co, t R^t = R,ss^t-1 + R, t

(162)

etc.., i.e. we wish to solve for the coefficients (∑,s)  RI and (∑,)  RI 5 such that the linear recursive law of motion satisfies the loglinearized equations. Note that the linear recursive law of motion implies that the conditional variances and covariances are constant and given by e.g.

c2,o = co, co, c,o,Rc,oR = co, R ,
In particular, the Sharpe ratio (100) can now be calculated.

69

In principle, this involves the calculation of a fixed point: the steady state requires knowledge of these variances and covariances, which can be calculated, given the linear recursive law of motion. But the latter is a solution to system of equations, whose coefficients depend on the steady state. An iterative procedure typically works well. As a first step, assume these variances, covariances and the Sharpe ratio to be zero, in which case one obtains the nonstochastic steady state. Use it to generate the loglinear approximation and solve it for the recursive law of motion. Calculate the implied variances and covariances, and use them to recalculate the steady state, etc..
This procedure was used in e.g. Canton (1997, 2002) in a different context. The procedure typically converges fast. In fact, typically a single step often suffices for all practical purposes. For that, use the nonstochastic steady state to generate a linear recursive law of motion, and use the latter to calculate variances and covariances.

A.5 A closed-form solution
We shall now provide a closed-form solution for the recursive law of motion, given the loglinearized system. The procedure follows the methodology explained in Uhlig (1999). We proceed in three steps. The first two steps concentrate entirely on calculating the deterministic law of motion. In the first step, we reduce the loglinearized equations to a system of three equations in s^t, c^t,y and c^t,o and their leads and lags. Plugging in the recursive law of motion, we obtain a system of three equations in the three coefficients cy,s, co,s and s,s, which we reduce to a quadratic equation in s,s and solve in the second step. With the solution to thee deterministic part at hand, we proceed to calculate the coefficients on the stochastic part by solving a linear system of equations in the third step.

A.5.1 Step 1: Reducing the system
Due to linearity, the solution to the deterministic part is obtained by solving the loglinearized system under the assumption that all shocks are equal to zero, i.e.

y^t = f n^t

(163)

70

cØyØc^t,y + cØoc^t,o + kØØk^t = AØf (ZØnØ)f n^t

(164)

w^t = -µf n^t

(165)

w^t - c^t,y = -(µv + v)n^t RØR^t = AØf (ZØnØ)f n^t
-c^t,y + (1 - )vn^t = -k^t - c^t+1,o + R^t+1

(166) (167) (168)

s^t-1 + c^t,o = ( - )

a^t 1-

+ c^t,y - (1 - )vn^t (169)

a^t 1-

=  (c^t,y + vn^t) + (1 - ) k^t + c^t+1,o

(170)

s^t = ( - )

a^t 1-

- k^t

+ ( - )c^t+1,o(171)

The first equation (163) is not needed for the reduction. Use the third and
the forth equation (165), (166) to express n^t in terms of c^t,y. Use that in the second equation (164) to express k^t in terms of c^t,y and c^t,o, in the fifth equation (167) to express R^t in terms of c^t,y and in the seventh equation
(169) to express a^t/(1 - ) in terms of c^t,y, c^t,o and c^t+1,o,

n^t = n,yc^t,y

k^t = k,yc^t,y + k,oc^t,o

R^t = R,yc^t,y

a^t 1-

=

a,yc^t,y + a,oc^t,o + a,Eoc^t+1,o

Use these results in the remaining sixth, seventh and ninth equation (168) (169) and (171) to obtain

0=

1,yc^t,y + 1,oc^t,o + 1,Eyc^t+1,y + 1,Eoc^t+1,o

st-1 =

2,yc^t,y + 2,oc^t,o

+ 2,Eoc^t+1,o

0 = -st + 3,yc^t,y + 3,oc^t,o

+ 3,Eoc^t+1,o

(172)

where

1,y =  - (1 - )vn,y - k,y 1,o = -k,o 1,Ey = R,y 1,Eo = - 2,y = ( - )a,y +  - (1 - )vn,y 2,o = ( - )a,o -  2,Eo = ( - )a,Eo 3,y = ( - )(a,y - k,y) 3,o = ( - )(a,o - k,o) 3,Eo = ( - )a,Eo +  - 

A.5.2 Step 2: A system of three coefficient equations
Use the deterministic part of the recursive law of motion
s^t = s,ss^t-1 c^t,y = cy,ss^t-1 c^t,o = co,ss^t-1
to replace all variables except st-1. For variables dated t + 1, this requires "plugging in twice". Comparing coefficients (or, equivalently, dividing by

72

st-1) yields

0=

1,ycy,s + 1,oco,s + 1,Eys,scy,s + 1,Eos,sco,s

1=

2,ycy,s + 2,oco,s

0 = -s,s + 3,ycy,s + 3,oco,s

+ 2,Eos,sco,s + 3,Eos,sco,s

(173)

Multiply the second equation with 3,Eo and the third with -2,Eo, add

and solve for cy,s,

cy,s = cy + cy,ss,s + cy,coco,s

(174)

where

cy

=

3,Eo 3,Eo2,y - 2,Eo3,y

cy,s

=

-2,Eo 3,Eo2,y - 2,Eo3,y

cy,co

=

2,Eo3,o - 3,Eo2,o 3,Eo2,y - 2,Eo3,y

Use that in the first two equations to replace cy,s,

0 = 4 + 4,ss,s + 4,oco,s + 4,sss2,s + 4,sos,sco,s

0 = 5 + 5,ss,s + 5,oco,s

+ 5,sos,sco,s (175)

where

4 = 1,ycy

4,s = 1,ycy,s

4,o = 1,ycy,co + 1,co

4,ss = 1,Eycy,s

4,so = 1,Eycy,co + 1,Eo

5 = 2,ycy - 1

5,s = 2,ycy,s

5,o = 2,ycy,co + 2,o

5,so =

2,Eo

Multiply the first of these two equations with 5,so, the second with -4,so, add and solve for co,s,

co,s = co + co,ss,s + co,ss2s,s

(176)

73

where

co

=

4,so5 - 5,so4 5,so4,o - 4,so5,o

co,s

=

4,so5,s - 5,so4,s 5,so4,o - 4,so5,o

co,ss

=

-5,so4,ss 5,so4,o - 4,so5,o

Use this to replace co,s in either of the two equations of (175). We use the second equation and obtain

0 = s + s,ss,s + s,ss2s,s + s,sss3s,s

(177)

where

s = 5 + 5,oco

s,s = 5,s + 5,oco,s + 5,soco

s,ss =

5,oco,ss + 5,soco,s

s,sss =

5,soco,ss

Equation (177) is a polynomial of third degree, which generally has three roots, s,s,i, i = 1, 2, 3, and for which closed-form solutions are available. If only one of these roots is stable, i.e. less than one in absolute value, then this

is the root we use. If there are more than one stable root, then an additional

state variable is needed as generally would be necessary to solve the system (175). If there are no stable roots, the system is explosive and our baseline

assumption that there is a stationary solution to the social planners problem

in the detrended variables unjustified.

Experimentation with reasonable parameter choices has only delivered the case of a single stable root. We shall therefore concentrate on that case

from here on. Thus, let s,s be that solution. The other two key coefficients co,s and cy,s can now be found from
equations (176) and (174). For the remaining variables, we have

n,s = n,ycy,s

y,s = f n,ycy,s

k,s = k,ycy,s + k,oco,s

w,s = -µf n,ycy,s

R,s = R,ycy,s

a,s =

a,y cy,s

+ a,oco,s + a,Eos,sco,s

(178)

74

where

a,s

the

A.5.3 Step 3: Solving for the coefficients on exogenous variables.
Solving for the exogenous variables is now a matter of solving a linear system of equations. In the equations (140) to (151) replace each endogenous variable dated t with the feedback rule given (162). The variable s^t-1 stays as is. The variables dated t + 1 show up in expectations, and are replaced with the feedback rules as e.g. in

Et[ct+1,o] = Et[co,sst + co, t+1] = co,ss,sst-1 + (co,sco, + co, N ) t

where s,s and co,s are now known, while we still seek to solve for co,.

The resulting system contains coefficients on the variable st-1, which we already know to hold from the calculations above. Let ∑, be the matrix of the to-be-solved-for feedback coefficients on the exogenous variables , given

by

 s, 

 cy, 

 

co,

 

 

n,

 

∑,

=

 

y,

 

 

k,

 

 

w,

 

 

R,

 

a,

(180)

75

where

a,

is

the

feedback

coefficient

for

a^t 1-

.

Take

the

feedback

coefficients

∑,s on s^t-1 as given via the calculations above, and compare coefficients

on the entries in t. By carefully examining the system or, alternatively,

exploiting the matrix algebra provided in Uhlig (1999), the remaining system

can be written in the form

V vec(∑,) = W

for some matrices V and W and the columnwise vectorization vec(∑,) of the matrix of coefficients ∑,. If N = 0, i.e., if the exogenous variables are iid, then this can be written more conveniently as

(C∑,) = D

In either case, one obtains a linear system in the entries of ∑,, which can be solved under the usual conditions for invertibility. We shall skip the tedious details on explicitely stating V and W or C and D.

2 = N 1 , 2 = ∑,s(1)s + ∑, 2

etc., where e.g. (0)s is the first entry (corresponding to s0) of 0.
