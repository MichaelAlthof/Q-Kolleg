Abstract
In this note we establish the existence of the first two moments of the asymptotic trace statistic, which appears as weak limit of the likelihood ratio statistic for testing the cointegration rank in a vector autoregressive model and whose moments may be used to develop panel cointegration tests. Moreover, we justify the common practice to approximate these moments by simulating a certain statistic, which converges weakly to the asymptotic trace statistic. To accomplish this we show that the moments of the mentioned statistic converge to those of the asymptotic trace statistic as the time dimension tends to infinity.

1 Motivation and Framework
Cointegration tests play an important role in the empirical analysis of long-run relationships among integrated variables, but they often suffer from low power properties due to the small time span of the available time series. The performance of the tests could be improved by enlarging the data basis, e.g. by considering additional cross-sectional units (individuals) with similar data. Therefore the cointegration methodology has been extended to the panel data framework. Similar to the case of testing for unit roots, panel cointegration tests may be based on standardizing the average of individual cointegration test statistics. By some central limit theorem, standard normal quantiles may then serve as critical values. However, the justification of such a procedure requires the existence of the first two moments of some distribution. For example, Larsson et al. (2001) used the likelihood framework to present a test for the cointegrating rank in heterogeneous panels. Their test, which they refer to as standardized LR-bar test, is based on the likelihood ratio (LR) test statistic developed by Johansen (1995) for vector autoregressive (VAR) models. Under the null hypothesis and as the time dimension approaches infinity, the LR statistic converges weakly to the asymptotic trace statistic, whose moments are thus used for standardizing the average of the individual LR test statistics.

The existence of the first two moments of the asymptotic trace statistic is claimed in Larsson et al. (2001), but their proof is incorrect as explained in Section 3. Therefore we provide a corrected version of the proof. Moreover, the asymptotic moments are usually approximated by simulating a certain statistic which converges weakly to the asymptotic trace statistic. To justify this approach we show that the first two moments of the mentioned statistic converge to those of the asymptotic trace statistic.

To be more specific, we consider, as Larsson et al. (2001), a sample of N cross-sections (individuals) observed over T time periods and suppose that for each individual i (i = 1, . . . , N ) the K-dimensional time series yit is generated by the following heterogeneous VAR(pi) model:

pi
yit = Aij yi,t-j + eit,
j=1

i = 1, . . . , N ; t = 1, . . . , T,

(1)

where the initial values yi,-pi+1, . . . , yi0 are fixed, Aij are (K × K) coefficient matrices and the errors eit are stochastically independent across i and t with eit  NK(0, i) for some
nonsingular covariance matrices i. The components of the process yit are assumed to be
integrated at most of order one and cointegrated with cointegrating rank ri with 0  ri  K.
The error correction representation of model (1) is

pi-1

yit = iyi,t-1 +

ij yi,t-j + eit,

j=1

i = 1, . . . , N ; t = 1, . . . , T,

where the (K × K) parameter matrices ij = -(Ai,j+1 + . . . + Ai,pi) describe the short-run dynamics, and the (K × K) matrix i = -(IK - Ai1 - . . . - Ai,pi) can be written as i = ii with (K × ri) matrices i and i of full column rank.
Interest is in testing whether in all of the N cross-sections there are at most r cointegrating relations among the K variables. Thus, the null hypothesis

H0(r) : rank(i) = ri  r, is tested against the alternative

for all i = 1, . . . , N,

H1 : rank(i) = K, for all i = 1, . . . , N.

According to Johansen (1988), the cointegrating rank of the process may be determined by a
sequential procedure. First, H0(0) is tested, and if this null hypothesis is rejected then H0(1) is tested. The procedure continues until the null hypothesis is not rejected or H0(K - 1) is rejected.

The standardized LR-bar statistic for the panel cointegrating rank test is defined by

 N
LR (r) =

N i=1

K j=r+1

ln(1

)

- E(Zd) ,

Var(Zd)

where ij is the jth largest eigenvalue to a suitable eigenvalue problem for the ith crosssection defined in Johansen (1995). Moreover, E(Zd) and Var(Zd) denote the mean and the variance, respectively, of the asymptotic trace statistic

Zd = tr

of -T

see,

e.g.,

(1995).

Under the null hypothesis and assuming suitable conditions, Larsson et al. (2001) applied

a central limit theorem to establish the asymptotic normality of their standardized LR-bar

statistic, so that standard normal quantiles may serve as critical values for the test. Moreover,

they approximated the first two moments of the asymptotic trace statistic Zd for different values d by simulation as sample moments of

This

is

motivated

by

the

weak

convergence of ZT,d to Zd as T  . Consequently, the proposed procedure relies crucially

on the fact that the first two moments of the asymptotic trace statistic exist and may be

obtained as limits of the corresponding moments of ZT,d.

2 Results

On account of the weak convergence of ZT,d to the asymptotic trace statistic Zd, the first two moments of Zd exist if the sequence {ZT2,d} is uniformly integrable. A sufficient condition for this is established in Lemma 2, which states that the fourth moments of ZT,d are uniformly bounded in T . We start with showing that all moments of ZT,d exist. To ensure that the inverted matrix appearing in (3) is nonsingular with probability one, we assume T > d.

Lemma 1. Assume that T > d. Then all moments of ZT,d defined by (3) exist.

Proof. As Larsson et al. (2001), we introduce the (T × d) matrices  = (1, 2, ..., T )

and X = (X1, X2, ..., XT ) as well as the (T × T ) matrices

Then, X = A and the (d × d) matrices appearing in (3) can be rewritten as

Defining D = BA and Y = D, we obtain therefore

(4)

ZT,d = tr(BT A-T 1BT ) = tr[ D( D D)-1 D ] = tr( PY )  tr( ),

(5) (6)

where PY = Y (Y Y )-1Y denotes the projection matrix onto the column space of Y . The

assumption t  Nd(0, Id) i.i.d. now implies tr ( ) =

T t=1

tt



T2 d,

which

completes

the

proof, since all moments of a 2-distributed random variable exist.

Note that inequality (6) cannot be used to bound the moments of ZT,d uniformly in T , because the moments of a 2-distributed random variable depend on the degrees of freedom.
Lemma 2. Let ZT,d be defined as in (3). Then there exist some constants a and b such that, for all T > d,

(i) E ZT2,d < a,

(ii) E ZT4,d < b.

Proof. Using an inequality of Coope (1994), we get, on account of (5),

ZT,d = tr(A-T 1BT BT )  tr(AT-1)tr(BT BT ),

(7)

since A-T 1 and BT BT are symmetric and nonnegative definite matrices of the same order.
To deal with AT , let 1  ...  T -1  T  0 and v1, . . . , vT be the eigenvalues and the associated orthonormal eigenvectors, respectively, of the symmetric and nonnegative definite
(T × T ) matrix F = D D. Then, for any m  {1, . . . , T - 1},

F = tvtvt

where denotes the L¨owner partial ordering for symmetric matrices. Because of the or-
thonormality of the matrix V = (v1, . . . , vT ), V  has the same distribution as , that is, with the notation of Muirhead (1982), V   N (0, IT  Id). This implies

m
 Fm = mU, with U :=  vtvt  Wd(m, Id),
t=1

and thus, in view of (4) and (8),

AT

Clearly, AT,m is almost surely positive definite if m  d. Then (9) leads to AT-,1m

it follows T = 0, and 1, . . . , T -1 are the eigenvalues of the positive definite matrix F~ obtained from F by deleting the last column and the last row. This matrix can be represented

Using Theorem 2 of Yueh (2005), the positive (ordered) eigenvalues of F can be represented

as

t = 2

1 - cos

(2t-1) 2T -1

for t = 1, . . . , T - 1.

The series expansion of the cosine function provides, for a fixed m  {1, . . . , T - 1} and as

Note that, for fixed m and T  , m is of the same order T 2 as the sum of all eigenvalues

of F , since

With the notation t = (t1, . . . , td) , the last term in inequality (7) may be written as

where

(12)

To prove (i), we first take the second power in (7) and apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which gives

E(ZT2,d)  E tr(A-T 1)tr(BT BT ) 2  E[tr(A-T 1)]4 E[tr(BT BT )]4 1/2 .

(13)

Consequently, it suffices to verify that both expectations on the right-hand side of inequality (13) are uniformly bounded in T > d.
In view of (12), E[tr(BT BT )]4 is uniformly bounded in T if, for i, j  {1, . . . , d}, supT E(i8j) < . But this follows from t  N (0, Id) i.i.d. and

E i8j

T TT

T

. . . . . . E (s1j . . . s8jt1i . . . t8i) ,

s1=1 s8=1 t1=s1+1 t8=s8+1

because E (s1j . . . s8jt1i . . . t8i) = 0 if more than eight of the subscripts s1, . . . , s8, t1, . . . , t8 differ.

Finally, to bound E[tr(A-T 1)]4 uniformly, we recall U  Wd(m, Id) and use results of von Rosen (1988, 1997) on moments for the inverted Wishart distribution. In particular it is known that the qth moments of U -1 exist if m - d - 2q + 1 > 0. Consequently,

E[tr(U -1)]4  c2 <  for m  d + 8,

(14)

so that an application of inequality (10) for m = d + 8 (assuming T > m) together with (11), (14) and Lemma 1 yields the desired result.
The proof of (ii) is analogous to that of (i) and thus only sketched. First, the CauchySchwarz inequality provides, using (7),

E(ZT4,d)  E tr(A-T 1)tr(BT BT ) 4  E[tr(AT-1)]8E[tr(BT BT )]8 1/2 .
It is easy to see that E[tr(BT BT )]8 is uniformly bounded in T , since supT E(i1j6) < . Finally, E[tr(A-T 1)]8 is uniformly bounded by choosing m = d + 16 and applying (10) together with (11), because then E[tr(U -1)]8  c3 < . This completes the proof.
Theorem. It holds that E(Zd2) <  and TlimE(ZTq ,d) = E(Zdq) for q = 1, 2. Proof. Recalling that ZT,d converges weakly to the asymptotic trace statistic Zd (Johansen, 1995), the result follows if {ZT2,d} is uniformly integrable (see Theorem A on p.14 in Serfling, 1980). A sufficient condition for the uniform integrability of {ZT2,d} is that E|ZT,d|2+ is uniformly bounded for some  > 0, i.e supT E|ZT,d|2+ < . But this is an immediate consequence of Lemma 2 (ii), completing the proof.

3 Discussion

Several authors have used the first two moments of the asymptotic trace statistic to base panel cointegration tests on a standardized average of individual cointegration test statistics; see, for instance, Larsson et al. (2001), Groen & Kleibergen (2003) and Breitung (2005). Our Theorem provides a theoretical justification for such an approach. To the best of our knowledge, the only attempt to establish this result is due to Larsson et al. (2001). However, the proof of their Lemma 1, which coincides with our Lemma 2, is incorrect and has thus initiated this note. In what follows, we comment in more detail on the proof by Larsson et al. (2001).

In our notation, Larsson et al. (2001) assumed t  Nd(0, ) i.i.d for defining ZT,d in (3). This seems to be unnecssary, but would not lead to complications in our proof. Moreover,

they used the spectral decomposition of the (random) positive definite (d × d) matrix AT (see (4)), i.e.

AT

=

1 T2

T
Xt-1Xt-1
t=1

=

G G,

where G is an orthogonal (d × d) matrix and  = diag(1, ..., d), and defined ~ by  = ~G. Then they rewrote (3) as

d
ZT,d = tr(BT G -1GBT ) = Hiii-1,
i=1

6

(compare also (5)), where Hii are the diagonal elements of H = T -2~ D ~~ D~. Finally, they applied the triangle and Cauchy-Schwarz inequalities to get

dd

1

E(ZT2,d) 

E(Hi4i)E(i-4)E(Hj4j)E(j-4) 4 ,

i=1 j=1

so that it remains to bound E(Hi4i) and E(j-4) (uniformly in T ).
The major difficulty with the proof of Larsson et al. (2001) is that the authors seem
to ignore the randomness of the matrix G. They argue, for example, that ~ = G has
the same distribution as  since G is orthogonal; but G depends on  (note that even for a
deterministic G the assumption   N (0, IT ) would generally imply a different distribution of ~: ~  N (0, IT  GG )). More importantly, to bound E(j-4) they state that  = GAT G = T -2~ D D~ follows some d-variate Wishart distribution with T - 1 degrees of freedom. However, we do not see how the diagonal matrix  can be Wishart distributed. Probably, the authors believe that AT = T -2 D D is Wishart distributed and use the orthogonality of G. As before, complications arise from the randomness of G. Moreover,
AT would be Wishart distributed if, for instance, the rows of D  N (0, DD  ) are independent or T -2D D is a projection matrix, but both statements do obviously not hold.
As intended by Larsson et al. (2001), we establish the existence of the first two moments of the asymptotic trace statistic by showing that the sequence {ZT2,d} is uniformly integrable. However, our corrected proof of their Lemma 1 uses basically inequality (8) and thus (9),
where we have to choose a fixed value of m in an appropriate way. On the one hand the moments of the inverted Wishart variable U -1 (with m degrees of freedom) must exist, and on the other hand the eigenvalue m must be of order T 2, which requires a careful investigation of the eigenvalues of the matrix F = D D.
