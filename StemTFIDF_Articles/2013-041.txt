ABSTRACT This paper concerns goodness-of-fit test for semiparametric copula models. Our contribution is two-fold: we first propose a new test constructed via the comparison between "in-sample" and "out-of-sample" pseudolikelihoods, which avoids the use of any probability integral transformations. Under the null hypothesis that the copula model is correctly specified, we show that the proposed test statistic converges in probability to a constant equal to the dimension of the parameter space and establish the asymptotic normality for the test. Second, we introduce a hybrid mechanism to combine several test statistics, so that the resulting test will make a desirable test power among the involved tests. This hybrid method is particularly appealing when there exists no single dominant optimal test. We conduct comprehensive simulation experiments to compare the proposed new test and hybrid approach with the best "blank test" shown in Genest et al. (2009). For illustration, we apply the proposed tests to analyze three real datasets.

1 Introduction
Assessing dependency among multiple variables is a primary task in business economics or financial applications. Copula is becoming increasingly popular in such fields due to its flexibility in seamlessly integrating sophisticated dependence structures and varying marginal distributions of multivariate random variables. For example, in Finance, copulas are widely applied to study dependency in asset pricing, asset allocation and risk management; see Klugman and Parsa (1999), Cherubini et al. (2004) and Cherubini et al. (2011), among others. More examples in other fields can be found in Frees and Valdez (1998), Wang and Wells (2000), Song (2007) and Danaher and Smith (2011), just to name a few.
Essentially, a parametric copula is a cumulative distribution function (CDF) specified by a certain known functional form up to some unknown dependence parameters. When a parametric copula is used in applications, misspecification on any of its parametric structure may cause misleading statistical estimation and inference. To check for the adequacy of a copula model, specification test has been extensively investigated in the literature. Wang and Wells (2000) proposed a rank based test in bivariate copulas. Malevergne and Sornette (2003) developed a test for the specification of Gaussian copula. Fermanian (2005) and Scaillet (2007) established goodness-of-fit tests through kernel techniques. Other types of specification tests include Panchenko's (2005) V-statistic type test, Prokhorov and Schmidt's (2009) conditional moment based test, Mesfioui et al.'s (2009) Spearman dependence based test, and Genest et al.'s (2011) Pickands dependence based test. Very recently, Huang and Prokhorov (2013) adopted White's test based on information matrix (White, 1982) to derive a test for copula models specification. With the utility of either Kendall's or Rosenblat's probability integral transformations, several other versions of specification tests have been proposed in the literature, including those proposed by Breymann et al. (2003), Dobric¥ and Schmid (2007) and Genest and Favre (2007), among others.
In a recent paper, Genest et al. (2009) made a thorough comparison for most of the existing "blank tests". A blank test refers to a test whose implementation does not require either an arbitrary categorization of data or any strategic choice of smoothing parameter, weight function, kernel or bandwidth. It is demonstrated by Genest et al. (2009) that none of these blank tests performs uniformly the best. It is interesting to note that , almost all of them had illustrated nearly no power in differentiating Gaussian copula and Student's t copula, both of which are very important
2

symmetric copulas with different tail dependence properties. Another challenge in the use of the tests considered in Genest et al. (2009) is that they rely on certain probability integral transformations, which may be difficult to derive analytically in many popular copula dependence models, e.g. Student's t copula and vine copulas (e.g. Kurowicka and Joe (2011)).
To overcome the difficulties above, we propose an alternative specification test for semiparametric copulas in this paper. The proposed test statistic takes a form of ratio constructed via two types of pseudo-likelihoods, one is "in-sample" pseudo-likelihood and the other is "out-ofsample" pseudo-likelihood. The idea behind the construction of the new test is rooted in the fact that, heuristically, a goodness-of-fit test is to examine how model fit the data. Thus, we vary data by the means of jackknife and quantify how sensitive the pseudo likelihood is to the varying data. Naturally, a comparison of pseudo likelihoods over different data sets are utilized to characterize how well the model fits the data. Inspired by Presnell and Boos's (2004) likelihood based in-andout-of-sample test, we term our proposed test as the pseudo in-and-out-sample (PIOS) test. In comparison to the tests in Genest et al. (2009), which are all indeed rank-based tests, our PIOS test is a pseudo likelihood based test, which does not require any probability integral transformation. Thus, as demonstrated later in the paper, the PIOS test is computationally simple and numerically stable.
Under the null hypothesis of copula model being correctly specified, we show that under some mild regularity conditions, the PIOS test statistic converges in probability to a constant equal to the dimension of parameter space of the null copula model. Also, we establish the asymptotic normality for the PIOS test statistic. Compared to the fully parametric in-and-out-of-sample test proposed by Presnell and Boos (2004), our work makes the following new contributions. First, the PIOS test is applicable to a semiparametric copula model in which the marginal CDFs may be fully unspecified. Second, Presnell and Boos's (2004) test is based on a single point data in-andout-of-sample procedure. As a useful extension, the PIOS test is based on a data block in-sample and out-of-sample procedure, where the size of block is allowed to increase with the sample size. Such flexibility is critical to extend the original idea to serially dependent time series data, as well as fast numerically calculation. Third, the development of asymptotic properties of the PIOS test is involved in the use of the theory of empirical processes with varying block size, and therefore such theoretical work is new and fundamentally different from that established in Presnell and
3

Boos (2004). Another primary focus of the paper is the development of a mechanism to combine several
test statistics and the resulting test is termed as the hybrid test in this paper. As demonstrated in Genest et al. (2009), there exists no single dominant asymptotically optimal test against general alternatives; see also Freedman (2009). The proposed hybrid test offers a compromise of several different tests, which is particularly appealing when there is no a prior knowledge about the top performer in the hypothesis test. We show that the proposed hybrid test can fully control type I error, as long as each of them does, and that it will be a consistent test as long as there exists one consistent test in the involved tests, regardless of the performance of the remaining tests. Our simulation studies clearly illustrate that, in general, the hybrid test enjoy the best finite sample performance.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is devoted to the detail for the construction of the PIOS test. Section 3 discusses the hybrid test. Section 4 presents the large sample properties of the proposed PIOS test statistic. Section 5 concerns Monte Carlo simulation studies to evaluate finite sample performances of the proposed PIOS test and hybrid test. In Section 6, the proposed tests are applied to three real datasets. The final section provides some concluding remarks. All technical details are included in the appendix.
2 Pseudo in-and-out-of-sample test (PIOST)
Suppose that X1 = (X11, ∑ ∑ ∑ , X1d)T, . . . , Xn = (Xn1, . . . , Xnd)T is a random sample of size n drawn from a multivariate distribution H(x) = H(x1, x2, . . . , xd) with continuous marginal CDF F(x) = {F1(x1), . . . , Fd(xd)}. According to Sklar's theorem (Sklar, 1959), we suppose that the joint distribution H(∑) can be expressed by the following representation:
H(x1, x2, ∑ ∑ ∑ , xd) = C0{F(x)} = C0{F1(x1), . . . , Fd(xd)},
where C0(∑) is the true copula function. The corresponding joint density function of H(∑), denoted by h(∑), takes the form of
d
h(x1, x2, ∑ ∑ ∑ , xd) = c0{F1(x1), . . . , Fd(xd)}  fk(xk), k=1
4

where, c0(u), u = (u1, . . . , ud)  (0, 1)d is the resulting copula density function of copula C0(∑) and fk(∑) are the corresponding marginal density functions of Fk(∑), k = 1, . . . , d. Throughout this paper, the marginal CDF F(∑) is not specified by any parametric forms.
In practice, we often assume that the underlying true copula C0 belongs to a parametric class , say,
C = {C(∑; ),   },

where  is a p-dimensional parameter space. It is well known that misspecification on any of its parametric structure of C(∑; ) may ruin likelihood based statistical estimation and inference. Hence, checking the model specification is an important task in model diagnosis. In the following, we are concern of with the development of a goodness-of-fit test on the hypotheses

H0 : C0  C = {C(∑; ) :   } vs. H1 : C0  C = {C(∑; ) :   } .

To begin, we first apply the so-called two-step pseudo maximum likelihood (PMLE) method

(e.g. Oakes (1994), Genest and Rivest (1995), Shih and Louis (1995) and Chen and Fan (2005)) to

estimate the dependence parameter . In order to avoid the estimated copula function from blowing up at the boundary of 0 or 1, let F~(x) = {F~1(x1), . . . , F~d(xd)} be the set of rescaled empirical marginal distributions, where the k-th component is given by

F~k ( xk )

=

1 n+1

n
I
t=1

(Xtk



xk) ,

(1)

where I (∑) is the indicator function. The corresponding set of empirical marginal density functions is denoted as f~(x) = { f~1(x1), . . . , f~d(xd)}. Let l{F~(Xt); } = log c{F~1(Xt1), . . . , F~d(Xtd); }, and let ^ be the two-step PMLE of  given by

n

^ = arg max  l  t=1

F~(Xt); 

.

(2)

Genest and Rivest (1995) investigate large sample properties of the above PMLE under the

assumption of the copula function being correctly specified, and Chen and Fan (2005) established asymptotic properties of the PLME ^ under a misspecified models.

To present our new test, let us randomly divide the original data {X1, . . . , Xn} into B blocks and denote the b-th block as Xb = (X1b, . . . , Xnbb ), b = 1, . . . , B. Without loss of generality, suppose Xib = Xn1+∑∑∑+nb-1+i and the k-th element of Xib is denoted by Xibk, k = 1, . . . , d, i = 1, . . . , nb,

5

and n1 + ∑ ∑ ∑ + nB = n. For the simplicity of exposition, we assume that all blocks have equal size, say, nb  m, and hence mB = n. With little technical effort, all arguments presented in the rest of this paper can be extended to the case of unequal block size. In a similar spirit to the "jackknife" resampling method (e.g. Efron (1982)), we can yield a set of delete-one-block PLMEs ^-b, 1  b  B, according to the following procedure:

Bm

 ^-b

=

arg max


b

=b i=1

l { F~ (Xib

); },

b = 1, . . . , B.

(3)

Note that the delete-one-block pseudo likelihood (out-of-sample) im=1 c{F~(Xib); ^-b} dk=1 f~(Xibk) measures how well the hypothesized model predicts the b-th block of observations Xb = (X1b, . . . , Xmb ). Obviously, if the full pseudo likelihood (in- sample) im=1 c{F~(Xib); ^} kd=1 f~k(Xibk) appears to be much larger than the out-of-sample counterpart, im=1 c{F~(Xib); ^-b} dk=1 f~(Xibk), then the fitted model is very sensitive to the b-th block of observations, implying that the hypothesized model
may be inadequate to fit the data. Thus, we can establish a global measure for goodness-of-fit using a comparison between the "in-sample" pseudo-likelihood, bB=1 im=1 c{F~(Xib); ^} kd=1 f~k(Xibk) and the "out-of-sample" pseudo-likelihood, bB=1 im=1 c{F~(Xib); ^-b} kd=1 f~(Xibk). Precisely, we propose a test statistic of the following form:

Bm
Tn(m) =   l{F~(Xib); ^} - l{F~(Xib); ^-b} . b=1 i=1

(4)

The resulting test is termed as the pseudo in-and-out-of-sample (PIOS) test. It is worth pointing

out that, when the margins are known and the block size is fixed as m  1, Tn(m) in (4) reduces to

the IOS test statistic proposed by Presnell and Boos (2004).

Under the null hypothesis of correct model specification, statistic Tn(m) in (4) is shown to converge in probability to p, the dimension of the parameter vector . Here, we present in a heuristic

argument as to why its limiting value is p. First, we define two types of Fisher information matri-

ces (Song (2007), Chapter 3), negative sensitivity matrix and variability matrix as follows:

S() = -E0 [l{F(X1); }] , V() = E0 l{F(X1); }lT{F(X1); } ,

where l(u; )

c(u;

),

l (u;

)

log c(u; ),

and

E0(∑)

represents

the

expectation

under the true copula C0. Throughout this paper, we assume there exists a  such that ^  

6

in probability under some regularity conditions. Refer to Chen and Fan (2005) for the regularity conditions required to establish such consistency under mispecified model. The point of interest is that, under suitable regularity conditions given in Theorem 2, we can show that

Tn(m) pr E0 lT{F(X1); }S()-1l{F(X1); } = tr S()-1V() , as n  ,

where tr(A) denotes the trace of a matrix A. As a result of the Bartlett's identity (White, 1982), a correct model specification implies V() = S(), so tr S()-1V() = p, the trace of the pdimensional identity matrix. Furthermore, Tn(m) - p, adjusted with a proper standard deviation, is asymptotically normalized distributed, which is the theoretical basis to define the rejection rule

for the hypothesis test.

To implement the proposed test statistic Tn(m) in practice we need to estimate dependence parameter [n/m] (the largest integer less than n/m) times, which may be computationally de-

manding. Indeed, we can approximate Tn(m) by the following test statistic, which is shown to be asymptotically equivalent to Tn(m) in Theorem 2(ii):

matrix, respectively, defined by

The statistic Rn given in (5) is similar to the information ratio (IR) test statistic proposed by Zhou et al. (2012) for cross-sectional and longitudinal data in the framework of estimating equa-

tions, which was later extended to time series data using martingale estimating equations in

Zhang et al. (2012).

3 Hybrid Test
In most of scenarios for goodness-of-fit test, including the one for copula models (e.g. Genest et al. (2009)) there exists no single dominate optimal test. It is often the case that at one occasion,
7

one test is more powerful, but at other occasions, other tests were more powerful. See also Freedman (2009). The same phenomenon also occurs in our simulation studies. At some occasions, PIOS outperforms others, but at other settings, other tests (such as the one proposed by Genest et al. (2009)) perform better. Inspired by Zhou et al. (2013), here we propose the following hybrid test that enables us to combine several different tests to achieve certain compromise in the test power. The resulting test, although may not have the highest power, outperforms on average any of individual tests used in the combination. This strategy is particularly appealing when there is no a prior knowledge regarding the top performer at a given occasion.
Consider q test statistics, denoted by Tn(1), Tn(2), . . . , Tn(q), where subscript n is the sample size. Suppose that all of them have type I error controlled at a given significance level  under a common null hypothesis. A hybrid test is constructed as follows: Let p(ni) denote the corresponding p-value obtained from the test statistic Tn(i), i = 1, . . . , q. A hybrid test, denoted by Tnhybrid, will make decision according to a p-value, defined as

pnhybrid = q ◊ min{pn(1), . . . , pn(q)}.

Consequently, the rejection rule of the hybrid test is that, if pnhybrid  , the null hypothesis is

rejected. This is equivalent to the situation where there is at least one test rejecting the null at the

level

of

 q

.

Under the null hypothesis H0 and a significance level , we have the type I error for the hybrid

test:

pr(pnhybrid  |H0) = pr(pn(1)  /q or ∑ ∑ ∑ or pn(q)  /q|H0)
q
  pr(pn(i)  /q|H0) i=1
 .

The above inequality shows that, provided that all of the test Tn(i), i = 1, . . . , q, have controlled

type I errors, the hybrid test Tnhybrid has its type I error controlled at .

The above inequality implies that (i) the power of the hybrid test is better than the test given by the strategy of Bonferroni correction for multiplicity; and (ii) more importantly, if there is at least one test that is consistent (namely, the power tends to 1 as the sample size increases to ), then the hybrid test is consistent. Our simulation studies also show that the hybrid test behave more desirably than any of individual tests.

4 Asymptotic Properties of PIOS test
In this section, we establish several asymptotic properties of the proposed PIOS test as well as the relationship between Tn(m) in (4) and Rn in (5). Throughout this paper, we denote x as the usual Euclidean metric of any vector x = (x1, . . . , xd)  Rd, namely, x = x12 + ∑ ∑ ∑ + xd2 and for any d ◊ d matrix A, A = id,j=1 A2ij, where Aij is the (i, j)-th element of A. Let N () denote an open neighborhood of .
Firstly, we establish the consistency of the test statistics Rn. To proceed, we need the following regularity conditions.
A1. The first-order and second-order derivatives, l(u; ) and l(u; ), are continuous with respective to  for any u  [0, 1]d; and there exist integrable functions G1(u) and G2(u) such that l(u; )lT(u; )  G1(u) and l(u; )  G2(u) for all   N ().
A2. Matrix S() = -E0l{F(X1); } is finite and nonsingular.
Assumption (A1) is the so-called dominating condition, which is commonly imposed in order to establish the uniform law of large number theorem (e.g. Wooldridge (1994)). Assumption (A2) requires the sensitivity matrix S() to be invertible, so that the test statistic Rn in (5) will be welldefined.

9

Theorem 1 Under conditions (A1)-(A2), we have Rn pr tr S()-1V() , as n  ,

where  is the limiting value of PMLE ^. The following regularity conditions are used to establish the central limit theorem for both Rn
and Tn(m).

B1. Denote Ji(u) = const ◊ dk=1 {uk(1 - uk)}-ik , where ik  0, i = 1, 2, ik are some constants. Suppose that for all   N , l(u; )lT(u; )  J1(u), l(u; )  J2(u), and E0 Ji2{F(X1)} <  .

Assumptions (B1) and (B2) are similar to the conditions in Lemma 2 of Chen and Fan (2005). Obviously, Assumption (B1) implies assumptions (A1). Assumption (B3) is commonly required in the literature to establish the uniform law of large number theorem .

This Assumption (C1) is needed to bound the difference between Rn and Tn(m), so that these two statistics have the same limiting distribution.
Under the above regularity conditions, we have the following results.

where R2 is the asymptotic variance given by equation (9) in the appendix, which can be consistently estimated by equation (10) in the appendix.

10

(ii) Under assumptions (A2),(B1)-B(3) and (C1), we have Rn - Tn(m) = op(n-1/2).
Remark 1 To establish a general theory of consistency for the proposed goodness-of-fit test is challenging due to the fact that it is difficulty to characterize proper alternatives against which the test is consistent. However, given a restricted set of alternatives, it is possible to establish the test consistency. For example, for the alternatives under which the sensitivity matrix S() differs from the variability matrix V(), following similar arguments as those given in the proof of Theorem 1, we can show that the PIOS test is consistent.
Remark 2 One issue in the use of the above PIOS test is how to select block-size m to achieve better performance. Our Monte Carlo simulations show that the choice of m depends on the underlying data generating process, and in most cases the PIOS test with block-size m = 1 behaves satisfactorily for independent cross-sectional data.
5 Simulation study
5.1 Setup
In this section, we conduct extensive Monte Carlo simulation experiments to evaluate the finite performance of the proposed tests Tn(m) in (4) and Rn in (5). We chose m = 1 and m = 3 that satisfy Condition (C1) for independent cross-sectional data. In the implementation of our tests, the asymptotic variance R2 needs to be estimated, what is not easy to be done directly. This leads us to the following semiparametric bootstrap procedure to numerically establish the null distribution of Rn. A similar bootstrap approach was considered in Genest et al. (2009). This bootstrap technique is also applied for the null distribution of test Tn(m) as well.
Let ^ be the PMLE and let F~(x) be the rescaled empirical distribution in (1). The semiparametric bootstrap proceeds as follows: Step 1. Generate a bootstrap sample X1(k), . . . , Xn(k) from the estimated copula C(u; ^) under the
null hypothesis and the marginal distribution F~(x);
Step 2. Estimate the dependence parameter  of the copula in the null hypothesis by the two-step PMLE method and compute the test statistic Rn, denoted by Rkn;

For the purpose of comparison, we include a test proposed by Genest et al. (2009), termed in short as GRB test. GRB test has been shown to have the best performance on average among all the existing "blank tests". In fact, GRB test statistic is a CramÈr-von Mises statistic based on Rosenblatt's transform (Rosenblatt, 1952), defined by

Genest et al. (2009) compared the finite-sample performance among seven types of blanket

tests, and concluded that none of these tests was uniformly superior. However, on average the

above GRB test Sn performed the best. To be fair, in our comparison setting, GRB is also implemented via the bootstrap method suggested by Genest et al. (2009), with the equal number of

bootstrap sample paths. We also consider two types of hybrid tests in the comparison. One is

a hybrid of Sn and Rn, denoted as SRn; and the other is a hybrid of Sn and Tn(m), denoted as STn(m). In test STn(m) for the sake of brevity we took m = 1
We consider four most popular bivariate copula families, namely Gaussian, Student's t, Clay-

ton and Gumbel. All of them have been investigated extensively in a vast literatures; see for

example, Song (2000), Chen and Fan (2005), Cossin and Schellhorn (2007), Song et al. (2009) and

Genest et al. (2009), just to name a few. The former two copulas are prominent examples of the

elliptical families and the latter two are mostly used Archimedean copulas. For the sake of self-

containedness, we present some brief descriptions of these four copula families in Appendix B.

12

In the implementation, whenever it is needed to estimate a parametric copula we use the PLME instead of the means of an inversion of the Kendall's  proposed by Genest et al. (2009).
To investigate the impact of dependence strength on the finite performance of tests, we set three values of dependence parameters in terms of Kendall's tau,  = 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75, respectively. For every possible choice of copula and a fixed dependence parameter, we also set two values of sample size as n = 100 and 300, respectively. In each experiment, we conduct M = 1000 rounds of simulations, in which N = 1000 bootstrap sample paths are generated for each simulation case to yield the null distribution. The simulation study has been undertaken on 64 Intel Xeon CPU Cores mit 2.67 GHz of Windows 2003 Server, over a period of two months.
5.2 Results
Tables 1 and 2 report the simulation results at nominal level 5% for all four copulas being true under H0 hypothesis. From both tables, we can see that the proposed tests Rn, Tn(m) and two hybrid tests SRn and STn(m) perform well on type I error control. The empirical type I error rates are marked with bold font for all cases. Regardless of the choice of sample size, the choice of dependence strength or the choice of copula family, the type I error is satisfactorily controlled at the level close to the nominal level. In this aspect, our new test Rn or Tn(m) is clearly comparable to the GRB test Sn.
In regard to the power comparison, we may draw following conclusions:
1. In general, there is no significant difference between the proposed test Tn(m) and its approximation version Rn, as well as between both hybrid tests STn(m) and SRn, regardless of choice of the dependence strength, the choice of sample size and chosen copula family.
2. The Tn(1) has overall better or equal performance to the Tn(3), because in the case of independent cross-sectional data using m = 3 shrinks the effective sample size. Thus in the later discussion on the comparison with other methods we only focus on Tn(1). This numerical evidence also is the basis for our use of Tn(1) in three empirical studies
3. In the cases where Student's t copula is given under H0, test Rn performs much better than Tn(1) test in most of cases, except the case when  = 0.75 and the true copula is the Clayton. Similar is observed for SRn and STn(1) tests, where SRn performs better than STn(1) in the
13

cases mentioned above.
4. The performance of the proposed Rn, Tn(1), SRn, STn(1) tests as well as GRB test is relied on the strength of the dependence. When  = 0.25 and sample size n = 100, with no surprise, all of the tests have almost no power. Up to our knowledge, there exists no single test that has desirable performance in such a setting of low correlation. Similar results are reported by Genest et al. (2009). This is because when Kendall's tau approximates to 0, the simulated data are drawn from a copula close to the independent copula. In this case, it becomes very hard to differentiate one copula from others. Obviously, in this case making a choice of the copula function form does not really matter. It is interesting to note that even in this situation of weak dependence all the proposed tests has demonstrated in contrary to GRB test to have relatively high power of rejecting Gaussian copula when the underlying is the Student's t copula. In the situation, when Student's t copula is under H0 and Gaussian copula is the true one, Rn and SRn tests perform much better than GRB, Tn(1) and STn(1) tests.
5. It is interesting to observe that all the proposed tests are significantly superior to GRB test to differentiate between Student's t copula and Gaussian copula. When the sample size increases to n = 300, Rn, Tn(1), SRn and STn(1) tests almost reaches 100% power as opposed to the power of GRB test lower than 70% .
6. When Kendall's tau is not too small ( = 0.5 or  = 0.75), and the sample size is large enough (n = 300), all the proposed tests behave very well. It is worth pointing out that in the following cases both Rn and Tn(1) tests perform poorly and are inferior to GBR, SRn and STn(1) tests: (a) when Gaussian is true and Gumbel is under H0; (b) when Gumbel is true and t under is H0; (c) Gaussian is true and Clayton under H0 for  = 0.5; and (d) Clayton is true and Student's t copula under H0 for  = 0.5. However, in all the remaining cases, the proposed Rn and Tn(1) tests together with hybrid ones SRn and STn(1) perform comparably or better than GRB test Sn.
7. As demonstrated clearly in the simulation studies both hybrid tests STn(1) and SRn showed clear advantages by getting individual tests (Rn and Sn or Tn(1) and Sn) involved. The hybrid tests have shown superior performances in all the cases, regardless of the choice of copula family or choice of dependency strength, and hence they are recommended to be
14

applied in practice.
6 Applications
In this section we present three empirical analyses using the proposed tests in this paper. In the first example we examine changes of the dependence structure over time between stock returns; the second example investigates joint behavior of residuals between high-frequency time series; and the third example studies the dependence structure of insurance data on losses and expenses.
6.1 Detecting structural changes in the dependency
We use daily returns of Citigroup (C) and Bank of America (BAC), over the period 2004-2012 for this first empirical study. We take each pair belonging to the same industry in order to have a strong dependence. It is known from recent studies (c.g. Hafner and Manner (2012), Patton (2012), H‰rdle et al. (2013)) that during the global financial crisis over years 2008-2010 the dependency between various financial instruments has been changed, which provides a venue to examine which of the tests would stay most stable in the calm period and be able to capture changes the dependency in the turbulent periods. First, we remove some temporal dependencies by the means of an ARMA(1,1)-GARCH(1,1) process for each year separately, and yield residuals for the analysis at the next step. Following the discussion in the paper, we use empirical marginal distributions to avoid influence of the margin misspecification. To visualize potential dependency changes, in Figure 1 we display via the scatterplots of the residuals transformed to standard normal distribution for years 2004 (left) and 2009 (right). The left plot of residuals for year 2004 shows a usual Gaussian elliptical shape, whereas in the right plot for year 2009, an asymmetric shape like "water-drop" appears in the scatterplot. This makes us wonder if a Gumbel copula would fit the underlying dependence. The p-values of five tests, namely, Tn(1), Rn, Sn and the two hybrid tests, for these two particular years are listed in Table 3, where the two hybrid tests confirm our visual inspection. In addition, we run all five tests over the period of 2004-2012 and select the copula dependency with the largest p-value for each year. These results are summarized in Table 4, which clearly indicate changes in the dependency structure before, during and after the crisis period of 2008-2009.

6.2 Copulas in high-frequency data

In the modern financial econometrics, multiplicative error models (MEM) are standard tools in modeling non-negative time series, e.g. Hautsch (2012), Cipollini and Gallo (2010) and Engle (2002). In this section of empirical study we consider the Vector MEM (VMEM) proposed by Cipollini and Gallo (2010), which is defined as follow,

xt = µt t = diag(µt)t,
where innovation vector t is a d-dimensional conditionally i.i.d. stochastic process and " " denotes the Hadamard (element-by-element) product. Its density is specified over R+d with a unit vector 1 as expectation and variance-covariance matrix , namely

t|Ft-1  D(1, ),
where Ft = (t, t-1, ∑ ∑ ∑ ) and D(1, ) is a multivariate distribution with mean vector 1 and covariance matrix . It follows that

E(xt|Ft-1) = µt; Var(xt|Ft-1) = µtµt

.

In order to model short-run effects and exclude low frequency patterns of the marginal time series, the marginal mean vectors µi,t for i = 1, . . . , d have been specified through a fractional integrations of order (1, 1), e.g. Hautsch (2012)

µi,t = [i + {1 - i - (i + i)(1 - L)i }xi,t] + iµi,t-1,

(6)

where L is the lag operator with Ljxt = xt-j; (1 - L) = j=0 (j)(-1)j Lj is the fractional difference operator with different  for each series; i, i and i with i + i < 1 for i = 1, . . . , d are the parameters of the model. This model may be further extended to a case when  and  are matrices for more precise multivariate modelling.
We apply the VMEM to analyze the high-frequency stock data for Apple as one of the most liquid stocks on NYSE. We extract the raw data of executed trades for the period of December 17th, 2009 to December 31st, 2009. The data has been cleaned using a similar method to that proposed in Hautsch (2012). The resulting cleaned data contain 10 min based numbers of trades (NT), volumes (Vol) and high-low differences (HL). Thus, in this example the process is three-dimensional,

16

namely NT, Vol and HL. The sample size is n = 300, consistent with that considered in the simulation study. Also we remove the U-shaped daily cyclic patterns via cubic splines. The issue of interest concerns the specification of multivariate distribution D for these three variables. A popular choice would be multivariate Gamma distribution, which does not necessarily describe the data well. Alternatively, some researchers suggest to separate margins and dependency in the VMEM (e.g. Cipollini and Gallo (2010)). To date, there is no work on specification test for copula model, and simply Gaussian copula has been used in the VMEM. As D is unknown, we first estimate the parameters of (6) through the PMLE under assumption of independent copula, implying diagonal covariance matrix . Having residuals obtained from MEM (6) we analyze them upon the needed appropriate multivariate dependence D and after specification of the copula reestimate fully specified model. A similar approach is used in SCOMDY models by Chen and Fan (2006) where one first estimates univariate GARCH, then find the copula based on the residuals and later re-estimate multivariate GARCH with correct copula specification. Figure 2 shows scatterplots of the residuals from univariate MEMs, which are transformed to the univariate normal distribution. These scatterplots suggest a hypothesis of Gumbel copula. Thus we perform all 5 tests for all pairs, namely (NT, Vol), (NT, HL) and (Vol, HL) as well as for the three-dimensional (NT, Vol, HL). The results are summarized in Tables 5. Here, we consider classical 3-dimensional Gaussian, Gumbel and Clayton copulas, as well as recently developed hierarchical Archimedean copulas (HAC) with Gumbel and Clayton generators (e.g. Okhrin et al. (2013a), Okhrin et al. (2013b)) and Vine copulas (e.g. Aas et al. (2009)). As seen from Table 5, for most of the pairs, the Gumbel copula is preferred for (NT, Vol), Gaussian copula for (HL, NT) and Clayton or Gumbel for (HL, Vol). For the 3-dimensional case, we are unable to derive GRB Sn test statistic for the vine copulas because of very complex forms of the copula density. So, no results on vine copulas have been reported for Sn nor for both hybrid tests (SRn and STn(1)). In the empirical study, either HAC Gumbel or simple Gumbel is accepted by the hybrid tests, as oppose to the conflicting results draws by the Sn and Tn(1) tests. This analysis illustrating an approach to determining an appropriate dependency of characteristics (e.g. Vol, HL or NT) of a stock.
17

6.3 Analysis of Losses and Allocated Loss Adjustment Expenses
Now, we apply the proposed tests to a well-known insurance dataset on losses and ALAEs, which are collected by the US Insurance Service Office. Such data has been previously analyzed by many authors, including, Frees and Valdez (1998), Genest et al. (1998), Klugman and Parsa (1999), Chen and Fan (2005) and Denuit et al. (2006), among others.
The dataset consists of 1500 general liability claims, among which 34 claims are censored due to late settlement lags. Each claim consists of an indemnity payment (i.e. the loss) and an allocated loss adjustment expense (ALAE). Here we determine a dependence model using the 1466 complete data. We run the proposed goodness-of-fit tests on four families of copulas, including Gaussian copula, Student's t copula, Gumbel copula and Clayton copula. For each copula, we estimate the dependence parameter by the PMLE approach described in Section 2.
Table 6 reports the results of PMLE, test statistics and p-values. The estimated freedom of degree of Student's t copula is 11.11. From Table 6, we find that Gumbel copula appears to be the most adequate and Gaussian copula is least suitable among the four copula models.
Our findings obtained by the hybrid tests are consistent with the model selection results reported by Frees and Valdez (1998), Genest et al. (1998), Chen and Fan (2005) and Denuit et al. (2006). Frees and Valdez (1998) and Denuit et al. (2006) point out a positive upper-tail dependence between loss and ALAE, implying that large losses tend to be associated to large ALAEs. This is because expensive claims usually take some time to be settled and induce extra costs for the insurance company. Thus, it is reasonable to observe a positive upper-tail dependence. On the other hand, no lower tail dependence is detected. Among the four copula models, Gumbel copula exhibits a strong upper-tail dependence, which properly reflects the relationship between loss and ALAE. The other copula models do not have similar features of upper tail dependence.
7 Conclusion
In this paper, we focus on goodness-of-fit test for specification of semiparametric copula dependence models. We propose a new method based on pseudo likelihood of cross-validation leading to the construction of a test statistics by comparing the "in-sample" pseudo-likelihood and "out-of-sample" pseudo-likelihood. As shown in theory and numerical examples, the pro-
18

posed comparison of pseudo likelihoods over different data sets has provide a highly competitive performance to indicate how well a model fits the data. To mitigate the computational burden of of the proposed Tn(m) test, we introduce Rn test, which shown similar performance to Tn(m) test. We establish the large sample properties for both Tn(m) and Rn tests. In comparison to the blank tests considered in Genest et al. (2009), all of which are rank-based tests, the proposed test enable us to avoid using any probability integral transformations.
Another main contribution of this paper is that we propose a hybrid mechanism to combine several different tests. In term of average performance, the hybrid test is clearly superior to any of individual tests used in the combination. An important property is that if there is at least one consistent test in the combination, then the hybrid test is consistent. This hybrid strategy is particularly appealing when there is no a prior knowledge which test might be the top performer at a given occasion.
We conduct extensive simulation experiments to investigate and compare the finite-sample performances between our proposed tests and the GRB test. The results of Monte Carlo simulations show that the proposed tests perform satisfactorily in type I error control and that they are very comparable to the best performer (i.e. GRB test) given by Genest et al. (2009). In particular, when the data are generated from Student's t copula, the proposed tests are more powerful than GRB test. Also, the proposed hybrid tests have shown a superior performance in all the cases, regardless of the choice of copula or choice of dependency strength, and hence they are highly recommended as a desirable method to be applied in practice. We also applied these proposed tests to three real datasets.
It is interesting to extend the proposed tests with independent cross-sectional data to time series data. Also, it is worth exploring the effect of block size on the test power. Finally, in this paper, we focus only on the occasion of 2-dimensional copula families, and it is of great interest to evaluate theses tests to multi-dimensional copulas, such as vine copulas.

where C0(∑) and C~(∑) are the true copula and the rescaled empirical copula. By condition (A1), applying Lemma 1(c) in Chen and Fan (2005)(see also Fermanian

Hence, using the two facts S^(^) - S()  S^(^) - S(^) + S(^) - S() , and ^ pr ,we obtained S^(^) pr S().
Applying the same arguments above, we can show V^ (^) pr V().
Furthermore, by condition (A2) and Slutsky's theorem, we have

Rn = tr S^(^)-1V^ (^) pr tr S()-1V() .

Proof of Theorem 2(i): First note that, ^ solves the equation tn=1 l{F~(Xt); ^} = 0. Applying the mean-value
theorem, we have
nn

Under the null hypothesis of the copula model being correctly specified, by Bartlett identity, we have S() = V(), moreover the test statistic Rn given in (5) can be represented as follows:

 n (Rn - p)

=

 ntr

S^-1(^)V^ (^) - Ip

=

S^-1(^)V^ (^) - S-1()V()

Utilizing the asymptotic expansion in (7) and (8), we have

 n

S^(^) - S()

=

k=1

hS{F~(Xt); } - S()

By conditions (B1) and (B2), employing Lemma 2 in Chen and Fan (2005) (see also

Ruymgaart et al. (1972), Ruymgaart (1974) or Genest and Rivest (1995)), we have S^(^) -

S() = Op(n-1/2) and V^ (^) - V() = Op(n-1/2). In addition, giving these facts:

 n

=

Note that the additional term D{F(X1); } comes from the uncertainty of the estimator for the marginal distribution function F(X1) = {F1(x1), ∑ ∑ ∑ , Fd(xd)}. It vanishes when F(X1) is known.
The asymptotic variance R2 may be consistently estimated by

To prove Theorem 2(ii), we need the following lemma.

Lemma 1 : Under the conditions (A1) and (C1), we have

sup

^ - ^-b

=

op(n-

3 4

).

1bB

Proof of Lemma 1: By equation (3), ^-b solves the following equation

Bm
0 =   l{F~(Xib ); ^-b}. b =1,b =b i=1

Expanding l{F~(Xib ); ^-b} around ^ leads to
Bm
0 =   l(F~(Xib ); ^-b) b =1,b =b i=1 m Bm = -  l{F~(Xib); ^} +   l{F~(Xib ); ~-b}(^-b - ^), i=1 b =1,b =b i=1

(11)

where ~-b lies between ^ and ^-b. It follows that

APPENDIX B This appendix is devoted to the copula models used in the Simulation and Empirical Studies.

1. The bivariate Gaussian copula is defined as

C(u1, u2; ) = {-1(u1), -1(u2); },

where (∑) is the standard univariate Gaussian distribution, (u1, u2; ) is the bi-

variate Gaussian distribution with zeros mean and unit variance, and   [-1, 1] is

the

dependence

coefficient

corresponding

to

Kendall's



=

2 

arcsin().

2. The Student's t copula is given by

C(u1, u2; ; ) = t- 1(u1) t-1(u2)
- -

1 2(1 - 2)1/2

1

+

x2

- 2xy + (1 - 2)

y2

-/2-1
dxdy,

where  is the number of degrees of freedom, and  is the dependence coefficient that

correspond

to

Kendall's



=

2 

arcsin().

Student's

t

copula

has

received

increasing

attention in the modeling of multivariate financial time series. Many empirical stud-

ies have shown that the Student's t copula fit better than Gaussian copula since the

former captures better the phenomenon of dependent extreme values, which is often

observed in financial asset return data. See for example Breymann et al. (2003) and

Demarta and McNeil (2005). Throughout the simulation study we fix the number of

degrees of freedom at  = 4 as in Genest et al. (2009). Varying  in the numerical

analysis of the GRB test is numerically challenging and computationally unstable

because of the Rosenblatt's transform.

3. Clayton copula (Clayton, 1978)

C(u1, u2; ) =

u1- + u2- - 1

-1/
,

where the dependence coefficient   0, which corresponds to Kendall's  = /( + 2). This copula represents lower tail dependency and is of particular interest in the modelling of Value-at-Risk.

32

4. Gumbel copula (Gumbel, 1960)

1/

C(u1, u2; ) = exp - (- log u1) + (- log u2)

,

with dependence coefficient   1 and the corresponding Kendall's  = 1 - 1/. This family is the only extreme value Archimedean copula which also represents an upper tail dependency. It is often used in the modeling of gains as well as in the modeling of joint maxima.
