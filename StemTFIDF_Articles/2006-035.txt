SPECTRAL CALIBRATION OF EXPONENTIAL LEVY MODELS
DENIS BELOMESTNY AND MARKUS REISS
1. Introduction
The calibration of financial models has become rather important topic in recent years mainly because of the need to price increasingly complex options in a consistent way. The choice of the underlying model is crucial for the good performance of any calibration procedure. Recent empirical evidences suggest that more complex models taking into account such phenomenons as jumps in the stock prices, smiles in implied volatilities and so on should be considered. Among most popular such models are Levy ones which are on the one hand able to produce complex behavior of the stock time series including jumps, heavy tails and on other hand remain tractable with respect to option pricing. The work on calibration methods for financial models based on L¥evy processes has mainly focused on certain parametrisations of the underlying L¥evy process with the notable exception of Cont and Tankov (2004). Since the characteristic triplet of a L¥evy process is a priori an infinite-dimensional object, the parametric approach is always exposed to the problem of misspecification, in particular when there is no inherent economic foundation of the parameters and they are only used to generate different shapes of possible jump distributions. In this work we propose and test a non-parametric calibration algorithm which is based on the inversion of the explicit pricing formula via Fourier transforms and a regularisation in the spectral domain.Using the Fast Fourier Transformation, the procedure is fast, easy to implement and yields good results in simulations in view of the severe ill-posedness of the underlying inverse problem.

2. Description of the method
Let the prices Y1, . . . , YN of N call options at strikes K1 < . . . < KN be observable

2.1. Data transformation. We transform the observations (Kj, Yj) to (xj, Oj) by
Oj := Yj/S - (1 - Kje-rT /S)+, xj := log(Kj/S) - rT,
where T is the time to maturity, r is a short rate and S is the spot price.

2.2. Estimation of O. Find function O~ among all functions O with two continuous derivatives that minimizes the penalized residual sum of squares

N +1

xN +1

(1) RSS(O, ) = (Oi - O(xi))2 + 

[O (u)]2 du,

i=0 x0

where x0 x1and xN+1 xN are two artificial points and ON+1 = O0 = 0. The first term in (1) measures closeness to the data, while the second term penalizes curvature in the function, and  establishes a tradeoff between the two. The two special cases are  = 0 when O~
interpolates the data and  =  when the simple least squares line is
fitted. It can be shown that that (1) has an explicit, finite dimensional,
unique minimizer which is a natural cubic spline with knots at the
unique values of xi, i = 1, . . . , N . The general cross validation can be used to choose  (see, for example, Green and Silverman (1994)). Note,
that due to the non-smooth behavior of O(x) at 0 (see Belomestny and
Reiﬂ (2004)) it is more reasonable to fit smoothing splines separately
for x > 0 and x  0 and combine them thereafter.

2.3. Estimation of FO. Since the solution of (1) is a natural cubic spline, we can write
N
O~(x) = jj(x)
j=1
where j(x), j = 1, . . . , N are set of basis function for representing the family of natural cubic splines. Now we estimate FO(v + i) by
N
F O~(v + i) = jF [e-xj(x)](v).
j=1

Although F [e-xj(x)] can be computed in the closed form we prefer using FFT and compute FO~(v + i) on the grid.

where log(∑) is taken in such a way that ~(v) is continuous with ~(-i) = 0.

2.5. Estimation of ,  and . With an estimate ~ of  at hand, we obtain estimators for the parametric part (2, , ) by an averaging
procedure taking into account the polynomial structure of . Upon
fixing the spectral cut-off value U , we set

U
(3) ^2 := Re(~(u))wU (u) du,
-U U
(4) ^ := Im(~(u))wU (u) du,
-U U
(5) ^ := Re(~(u))wU (u) du,
-U

where the weight functions wU , wU and wU are given explicitly by

wU (u)

where K(x) is a compactly supported kernel. In all simulations we take

K(x) = 1 - (x/U)2 +, x  R

for some U which may differ from U . The use of an additional cut-off parameter U can improve the quality of ^ significantly.

4 DENIS BELOMESTNY AND MARKUS REISS

2.7. Correction of . Due to the estimation error and as a result of
the cut-off procedure in (6) the estimate ^ can take negative values and needs correcting. Our aim is therefore to find ^+ such that

subject to

min,

inf ^+(x)  0
xR

^+(x) dx = ^(x) dx.
RR
It can be easily shown that the solution of the above problem is given by
^+(x; ) := max{0, ^(x) - }, x  R
where  is chosen to satisfy the equation

^+(u; ) du = ^(u) du.
RR

2.8. Choice of parameters. In our simulations the following heuristic criteria for choosing the spectral cut-off parameter U  is employed

(7)

U  = argminU

d dU

^U

.

So, U  corresponds to the flattest region of the curve U  ^U or in other words the region where ^U stabilizes. Other possible approaches to choose U include stagewise aggregation discussed in Belomesnty and
Reiﬂ (2005) and risk hull minimization developed by Cavalier and Golubev (2005). As to U, it can be found as a point where ^U stabilizes

(8)

U = argminU

d dU

In the case of real data examples when the Levy model serves as an
approximation only the following criteria can be useful. One defines U  as a solution of the following minimization problem

N

where C(K; TU ) is the price at strike K computed using the Levy model with the triplet TU = (^U , ^U , ^U ).

3. Simulated and Real Data Examples

In this section we present simulated as well as real data examples
demonstrating the performance of the calibration algorithm proposed.
In our simulations different data designs, sample sizes and noise lev-
els are used in order to investigate the behavior of the procedure in
circumstances mimicking real ones. The data design {xi} is chosen to be normally distributed with zero mean and variance 1/3 and hence is
similar to the one observed on the market where much more contracts
are settled at the money than in- or out of money. Upon simulating
the design, {O(xi)} are computed from the underlying model and then contaminated by the noise with zero mean and variances of the order {[ O(xi)]2}. In section 3.1 the Merton jump diffusion model is considered where jumps are normally distributed with mean  and variance 2

(x) =  exp  2

-

(x

- )2 22

,

x  R.

The parameter  in the L¥evy triple (2, , ) is uniquely determined by the martingale condition

 = -(2/2 + (exp(2/2 + ) - 1)).

Our choice of parameters

 = 0.1,  = 5,  = -0.1,  = 0.2

implies  = 0.371. Note, that under such a choice the mean jump size is negative and the model reflects the important feature observed on the market. More interesting example of Kou model is considered in section 3.2 where L¥evy density  is given by

(x) =  p+e-+x1[0,)(x) + (1 - p)-e-x1(-,0)(x) , x  R.
and +, -  0, p  [0, 1] are parameters. Again the parameter  is given explicitly by
 = -(2/2 + (p/(+ - 1) - (1 - p)/(- + 1)))
and under the choice
 = 0.1,  = 5, - = 4, + = 8, p = 1/3
one has  = 0.424. The Kou model allows us to model different tails behavior for positive and negative jumps and hence makes the modelling more realistic. Finally, in section 3.3 two real data examples are presented. Both data

6 DENIS BELOMESTNY AND MARKUS REISS
sets consist of DAX options (put and call) for different maturities and strikes. L¥evy models are calibrated separately for each maturity.

4. Conclusions
∑ The performance of the procedure depends strongly on the noise level and the number of observations the first being dominating.
∑ The smoother is the L¥evy density the better is the performance of the procedure the difference being more pronounced for smaller noise levels.
∑ The main features of L¥evy measures (different tails behavior, negative mean jump size) are preserved during the reconstruction.
∑ In the real data examples the algorithm produces stable estimates for ,  decreasing with maturity, jump distributions with negative mean jump sizes, and by rather small complexity of L¥evy measures fits the data in a reasonable way.
