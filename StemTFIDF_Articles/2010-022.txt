Fitting high-dimensional Copulae to Data
Ostap Okhrin
May 13, 2010
Abstract: This paper make an overview of the copula theory from a practical side. We consider different methods of copula estimation and different Goodness-of-Fit tests for model selection. In the GoF section we apply Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Cramer-von-Mises type tests and calculate power of these tests under different assumptions. Novating in this paper is that all the procedures are done in dimensions higher than two, and in comparison to other papers we consider not only simple Archimedean and Gaussian copulae but also Hierarchical Archimedean Copulae. Afterwards we provide an empirical part to support the theory.
Keywords: copula; multivariate distribution; Archimedean copula; GoF.

1 Introduction
Many practical problems arise from modelling high dimensional distributions. Precise modelling is important in fitting of asset returns, insurance payments, overflows from a dam and so on. Often practitioners stay ahead of potential problems by using assets backed up in huge portfolios, payments spatially distributed over land, and dams located on rivers where there are already other hydrological stations. This means that univariate problems are extended to multivariate ones in which all the univariate ones are dependent on each other. Until the late 1990s elliptical distribution, in particular the multivariate normal one, was the most desired distribution in practical applications. However the normal distribution does not, in practice, meet most applications. Some studies (see e.g Fama (1965), Mandelbrot (1965), etc.) show that daily returns are not normally distributed but follow stable distributions. This means that on one hand one cannot take the distribution in which margins are normal, and on the other hand, stable multivariate distributions are difficult to implement. In the hydrological problem, margins arise from extreme value distribution, while one is interested in the maximal value of the water collected after the winter season over a number of years, this value arises from the family

Figure 1: Scatter plots of bivariate samples with different dependency structures
of extreme distributions. As in the previous example, the multivariate extreme value distribution family is also somewhat restrictive.
Two further problems are illustrated in Figure 1. The scatter plot in the first figure shows the realisations of two Gaussian random variables. The points are symmetric and no extreme outliers can be observed. In contrary, the second picture exhibits numerous outliers. The outliers in the first and third quadrants show that extreme values often occur simultaneously for both variables. Such behaviour is observed in crisis periods, when strong negative movements on financial markets occur simultaneously. On the third figure we observe that the dependency between the negative values is different compared to the positive values. This type of non-symmetric dependency cannot be modeled by elliptical distributions, because they impose a very specific radially symmetric dependency structure.
Following these examples we need a solution to easily separate the modelling of the dependency structure and the margins. This is one of the tasks of copulae; to enable the modelling of marginals separately from the dependency. The above problem concerning assets could be solved by taking margins from the stable distribution and the dependency, as in the multivariate one. Similar solutions could be found for other problems. In finance, copulae are applied in different fields such as credit portfolio modelling and risk management.
Over the last 40 years, copula has only been attractive from a mathematical perspective, and only as late as 1999 were the different complicated properties of copula, such as the distribution (which made it more flexible), settled and solved. Nowadays dependency plays a key role in many financial models, starting from the basic portfolio theory of
2

Markowitz. Recent developments strongly support the joint non-Gaussianity of asset returns and exploit numerous alternative approaches to model the underlying distribution. The key role of dependency can be best illustrated by the famous quote "Given the prices of single-bet financial contracts, what is the price of multiple-bet contracts? There is no unique answer to that question...". The first application of copulae to financial data was carried out by Embrechts, McNeil and Straumann (1999). In this paper copulae were used in risk management framework which stimulated a series of ground breaking applied papers. Breymann, Dias and Embrechts (2003) model the dependencies of highfrequency data. An application to risk management is discussed in Junker and May (2005). Portfolio selection problems were considered in Hennessy and Lapan (2002) and in Patton (2004). Theoretical foundations of copula-based GARCH models and its application were proposed by Chen and Fan (2005). Lee and Long (2009), Giacomini, H®ardle and Spokoiny (2009) and H®ardle, Okhrin and Okhrin (2010) consider time varying copulae.
The new fields of application show the need for further theoretical developments. Each proposed model should be estimated with either parametric, semi- or nonparametric methods. The semiparametric estimation of the copula-based distribution, which is based on the nonparametric estimation of margins and estimation of the parameter for the fixed copula function, is discussed in Chen and Fan (2006), Chen, Fan and Tsyrennikov (2006), Genest, Ghoudi and Rivest (1995), Joe (2005), Wang and Wells (2000). Fully nonparametric estimation is discussed in Fermanian and Scaillet (2003), Chen and Huang (2007), Lejeune and Sarda (1992). To measure how well a copula-based statistical model fits the data, several goodness-of-fit tests were developed and discussed in the papers by Chen and Fan (2005), Chen, Fan and Patton (2004), Fermanian (2005) and Genest, Quessy and R¥emillard (2006), Genest and R¥emillard (2008), Breymann et al. (2003). In-depth discussion of simulation methodologies for Archimedean copulae can be found in Whelan (2004) and McNeil (2008). A detailed review and discussion of copula theory is given in Joe (1997) and Nelsen (2006).
In this chapter we describe the attractive features of copulae from the statistical perspective, with examples and applications in real data. We consider the most important copula classes with different methods of estimation and goodness-of-fit tests. We compare different goodness-of-fit tests by their rejection rates, for which a profound simulation study has been devised. In the empirical part of the chapter we apply different copula models to the normalised residuals and test the quality of the fit by discussed goodness-of-fit tests. We found that for the selected datasets hierarchical Archimedean copula outperform the simple Archimedean copula and the Gaussian copula by all goodness-of-fit tests.
2 Theoretical Background
From the early days of the multivariate probability theory it is well known, that given the d-variate distribution function F : R  [0; 1] of a d-variate random vector (X1, . . . , Xd) the distribution function, called marginal distribution function of each of the d components
3

X1, . . . , Xd is easily computed:

F1(x) = F (x, +, . . . , +), F2(x) = F (+, x, +, . . . , +),
∑∑∑ Fd(x) = F (+, . . . , +, x).

The converse problem was studied by Fr¥echet (1951), Hoeffding (1940), Hoeffding (1941),
where having the distribution functions F1, . . . , Fd of d random variables X1, . . . , Xd defined on the same probability space (, F, P) they wanted to make a conclusions about the set (F1 . . . , Fd) of the d-variate distribution functions whose marginals are F1, . . . , Fd

= = ∑∑∑ =

F (x, +, . . . , +), F (+, x, +, . . . , +),
F (+, . . . , +, x).

Nowadays the set (F1, . . . , Fd) is called the Fr¥echet class of F1, . . . , Fd.  is not empty, because it always contains the independence case in which F (x1, . . . , xd) = F1(x1) ∑ ∑ ∑ ∑ ∑ Fd(xd), x1, . . . , xd  R. Dealing with Fr¥echet classes, one often interests in the bounds and members of the . Dall'Aglio (1972) studies conditions under which there is only
one distribution function which belongs to (F1, . . . , Fd). A nice and short review of the Fr¥echet classes can be found in Joe (1997).

In 1959 Sklar found the partial solution to the above mentioned problem by introducing

copulae. Because there are a variety of copula definitions we will first look at the most

general one. For product [a, b] =

thijds=w1[eajw, biljl],newehdetroe,dfeofirneevtehrye

C -volume index j 

with the {1, 2, . . .

d-box that is a , d}, 0  aj 

cartesian bj  1.

Definition 1 For a function C : [0; 1]d  [0; 1], the C-volume Vc of the box [a, b] is defined via

Vc([a, b])

d=ef

 sig n(v)C (v),

v

where the sum is carried over all the 2d vertices v of the box [a, b]. Here also

{

sing(v) =

1, if vj = aj for an even number of vertices, -1, if vj = aj for an odd number of vertices.

Here is the definition of a copula, see H®ardle and Simar (2007): Definition 2 A function C : [0, 1]d  [0, 1] is a d-dimensional copula if
1. C(x1, . . . , xd) = 0, when xj = 0 for at least one index j  {1, . . . , d}; 4

2. C(1, 1, . . . , xj, 1 . . . , 1) = xj;
3. the Vc-volume of every d-box [a, b] is positive: Vc([a, b])  0.
The set of all the d-dimensional copulae (d  3) in the rest of the chapter is denoted as Cd, while the set of all bivariate (d = 2) copulae is denoted by C. As already mentioned above, this simple family of functions has been extremely popular because of its property given in the Sklar (1959) theorem

Theorem 1 Given a d-dimensional distribution function F , a copula C  Cd exists such that for all (x1, . . . , xd)  Rd:

F (x1, . . . , xd) = C{F1(x1), . . . , Fd(xd)}.

are

C(u1, . . . , ud) = F {F1-1(u1), . . . , Fd-1(ud)}.

(2)

Conversely, if F1, . . . , Fd are d one-dimensional distribution functions, then the function F defined in (1) is a d-dimensional distribution function.

Sklar's theorem also answers the question of the uniqueness of the copula C. However, if, for example, in the two dimensional case at least one of the two distribution functions has a discrete component, there may be more than one copula extending C from F1(R)◊F2(R) to the whole unit square [0, 1]2. This is due to a fact that C is uniquely defined only on the product of the ranges F1(R)◊F2(R). In this case it is good to have a procedure of bilinear interpolation in order to single out a unique copula. In the variety of papers where copulae are applied in different fields, authors usually do not consider the assumption that the random variables are continuous. This assumption is necessary to avoid problems with non-uniqueness. The second part of the Sklar's theorem is based on the construction of the multivariate distribution from the margins and the copula function. It is extremely popular in practice, where, for example, in risk management, analysts may have a better idea about the marginal behaviour of individual risk factors, than about their dependency structure. This approach allows them to combine marginal models and to investigate the sensitivity of risk to the dependence specification.
New multivariate distributions are created in two steps. At first, all univariate random variables X1, . . . , Xd are separately described by their marginal distributions F1, . . . , Fd. Then secondly, the copula C  Cd which contains all the information about the relationship between the original variables X1, . . . , Xd ≠ not taking into account the information provided by F1, . . . , Fd ≠ is introduced.
Being armed with the remarks written above, one can write the following copula definition

Definition 3 A d-dimensional copula is a cumulative distribution function on [0, 1]d with standard uniform marginal cumulative distribution functions.

5

As in the case of the multivariate distribution, mentioned at the beginning, setting all of

the arguments equal to + one gets an univariate marginal distribution. A univariate

marginal of copula C is obtained by setting some of its arguments equal to 1. Similarly

the m-marginal of C simple combinatoric

C.

A copula C satisfies a set of different important conditions, one of which is the Lipschitz condition which says that:

d |C(u1, . . . , ud) - C(v1, . . . , vd)|  |vj - uj|.
j=1

Another property says, that j  {1, . . . , d}, {u1, . . . , uj-1, t, uj+1, . . . , ud}, t  [0, 1], the functions t  C(u1, . . . , uj-1, t, uj+1, . . . , ud) are increasing as functions of t.
To get a better impression of what a copula is from a definition, let us consider a special bivariate case. Explicitly, a bivariate copula is a function C : [0, 1]2  [0, 1] such that:

1. u  [0, 1] C(u, 0) = C(0, u) = 0; 2. u  [0, 1] C(u, 1) = C(1, u) = u; 3. u, u, v, v  [0, 1] with u  u and v  v
C(u, v) - C(u, v) - C(u, v) + C(u, v)  0.

The last inequality is referred to as the rectangular inequality and the function that satisfies it is said to be 2-increasing. The bivariate copula is always of special interest, because of the properties that are difficult to derive in higher dimensions.

The property of increasingness with respect to each argument could be profound for the bivariate copula in the following way. As we know from above, if C is a bivariate copula, then functions [0, 1]  t  C(t, v) and [0, 1]  t  C(v, t) are increasing with respect to t. The increasingness with respect to each argument means that derivatives with respect to Lebegue measure exist almost everywhere, and those derivatives are positive where they exist. From the Lipschitz conditions they are also bound above

0  C(s, t)  1, 0  C(s, t)  1. s t
Every copula can be expressed in the form of the sum of absolutely continuous and singular part and an absolutely continuous copula C has a density c such that

 1 1

C(u1, . . . , ud) = c(s1, . . . , sd)ds1 . . . dsd = ds1 . . . c(s1, . . . , sd)dsd

00

from which the copula density is found by differentiation

c(u1, . . . , ud)

=

dC(u1, . . . , ud) . u1 . . . ud

6

Following the Sklar theorem, the multivariate distribution F with margins F1, . . . , Fd has multivariate density f with marginal densities f1, . . . , fd respectively. If, from the Sklar theorem copula C exists such that F (x1, . . . , xd) = C{F1(x1), . . . , Fd(xd)} then the d-variate density is

f (x1, . . . , xd) = c{F1(x1), . . . , Fd(xd)} ∑ f1(x1) . . . fd(xd).

(3)

Notice, however, that, as a consequence of the Lipschitz condition, for every bivariate copula C and for every v  [0, 1], both functions t  C(t, v) and t  C(v, t) are absolutely continuous so that
t t C(t, v) = c1v(s)ds and C(v, t) = c2v(s)ds.
00
Unfortunately, this representation has no application so far.

3 Copula Classes
Naturally, there are an infinite number of different copula functions satisfying the assumptions of definition. In this section we discuss in details three important classes of simple, elliptical and Archimedean copulae.

3.1 Simple Copulae

Often we are interested in some extreme, special cases, like independence and perfect positive or negative dependence. If d-random variables X1, . . . , Xd are stochastically independent from the Sklar Theorem the structure of such a relationship is given by the product (independence) copula defined as

d (u1, . . . , ud) = uj, u1, . . . , ud  [0, 1].
j=1
Another two extremes are the lower and upper Fr¥echet-Hoeffding bounds. They represent the perfect negative and positive dependencies respectively

( d

)

W (u1, . . . , ud) = max 0, uj + 1 - d ,

j=1

M (u1, . . . , ud) = min(u1, . . . , ud), u1, . . . , ud  [0, 1].

If, in a two dimensional case C = W and (X1, X2)  C(F1, F2) then X2 is a decreasing function of X1. Similarly, if C = M , then X2 is an increasing function of X1. In other words both M and W are singular, where M uniformly spreads the probability mass on
the diagonal X1 = X2 and W uniformly spreads the probability mass on the opposite

diagonal X1 = -X2. In general we can argue that an arbitrary copula which represents some dependency structure lies between these two bounds, i.e.
W (u1, . . . , ud)  C(u1, . . . , ud)  M (u1, . . . , ud).
The bounds serve as benchmarks for the evaluation of the dependency magnitude. Note, however, that the lower Fr¥echet-Hoeffding bound is not a proper copula function for d > 2 but is a proper quasi-copula. Both upper and lower bounds are sharp, because there are copulae, that are either equal, at some points, to one of the two bounds.
The simple copulae for the two dimensional case are plotted in Figure 2.

3.2 Elliptical Copulae

Due to the popularity of Gaussian and t-distributions in financial applications, elliptical copulae also play an important role. For example, in the modelling of collateralized debt obligations, where the assumption of the Gaussian one-factor dependency between joint default of the obligors, proposed by Li (2000), is seen as a standard approach. The construction of this type of copulae is based directly on the Sklar Theorem. The Gaussian copula and its copula density are given by:

CN (u1, . . . , ud, ) = {-1(u1), . . . , -1(ud)},

cN

(u1, . . . , ud, ) = ||-1/2 exp

where  is a d-dimensional normal distribution with a zero mean and the correlation matrix . The variances of the variables are imposed by the marginal distributions. Note, that in the multivariate case the implementation of elliptical copulae is very involved due to technical difficulties with multivariate cdf's. The level plots of the two-dimensional respective densities with different margins are given in Figure 3.

Using (2) one can derive the copula function for an arbitrary elliptical distribution. The problem is, however, that such copulae depend on the inverse distribution functions and these are rarely available in an explicit form. Therefore, the next class of copulae with its generalisations provides an important flexible and rich family of alternatives to the elliptical copulae.

3.3 Archimedean Copulae

In contrast to elliptical copulae, Archimedean copulae have a special method of construction which does not use (2), but fulfills all the conditions of the copula. Having M as an univariate distribution function of the positive random variable let  be the Laplace transform of M ,  = LS(M )

 (s) = e-sw dM (w), s  0.

(4)

0

Thus, M is said to be the inverse Laplace transform of , M = LS-1(). We denote as L the class of Laplace transforms which contain strictly decreasing differentiable functions, see Joe (1997):

L = { : [0; )  [0, 1] | (0) = 1, () = 0; (-1)j(j)  0; j = 1, . . . , }.

It is known, that for an arbitrary univariate distribution function F , a unique distribution function G exists such that
 F (x) = G(x) dM () = {- log G(x)}.
0
This leads to G = exp{-[-1](F )}, where [-1] is the generalised inverse

[-1](x)

=

{

-1(x) 0

for 0  x < (0); else.

9

Taking d univariate distributions F1, . . . , Fd, a simple extension leads to the multivariate distribution function that belongs to (F1, . . . , Fd)

(5)

The function  is called the generator of the Archimedean copula. Throughout the chapter the notation -1 is understood as the generalised inverse [-1]. Usually generator function depends on the parameter  which is set to be the parameter of the copula. It is easy to see, that Archimedean copulae are exchangeable. In two-dimensional cases they are symmetric in the sense that C(u, v) = C(v, u), u, v  [0, 1]. Joe (1997) and Nelsen (2006) provide a classified list of the typical Archimedean generators. Here we discuss the three most commonly used ones in financial applications, Archimedean copulae.

The first, widely used (in practice) copula is the Gumbel (1960) copula, which gained its popularity from the extreme value theory. The multivariate distribution based on the Gumbel copula with univariate extreme value marginal distributions is the only extreme value distribution based on an Archimedean copula, see Genest and Rivest (1989). Moreover, all distributions based on Archimedean copulae belong to its domain of attraction under common regularity conditions. Direct and inverse generators of the Gumbel copula with the copula function are given by

(x, ) = exp {-x1/}, 1   < , x  [0, ),

-1(x, )

x), 1 { d





<

}, x-1[0,

1],

C(u1, . . . , ud) = exp -

(- log uj)  , u1, . . . , ud  [0, 1].

j=1

The Gumbel copula leads to asymmetric contour diagrams and shows stronger linkage between positive values, however, is also shows more variability and more mass in the negative tail.
For  = 1, the Gumbel copula reduces to the product copula and for    we obtain the Fr¥echet-Hoeffding upper bound. This copula does not have an extension to the negative dependence. The Gumbel copula is one of a few Archimedean copulae for which we have an explicit form of the distribution function M from (4). In the case of Gumbel copula M is the stable distribution, see Renyi (1970). This information is very useful in the simulation techniques, especially for the Marshall and Olkin (1988) method, see Section Simulations 4.
Another example is the Clayton (1978) copula which, in contrary to the Gumbel, has more mass on the lower tail, and less on the upper. This copula is often used in the

10

modelling of the losses, which is of interest, for example, in insurance and finance. The necessary functions for this example are

As the parameter  tends to infinity, dependence becomes maximal and the copula gives the upper Frechet-Hoeffding bound. As  tends to zero, we have independence. As   -1/(d - 1), the distribution tends to the lower Fr¥echet bound.

Another interesting Archimedean copula is the so called Frank (1979) copula, which, in the bivariate case, is the only elliptical Archimedean copula in the sense that C(u, v) = u + v - 1 + C(1 - u, 1 - v) = C(u, v), where C(u, v) is called the survival or associative copula. C(u, v) is also a copula for a survival bivariate distribution. Direct and inverse generator of the Frank copula with the copula functions are

3.4 Hierarchical Archimedean Copulae

A recently developed flexible method is provided by hierarchical Archimedean copulae (HAC). The special, so called partially nested, case of HAC:

C(u1, . . . , ud) = C0{C1(u1, . . . , uk1), . . . , Cm(ukm-1+1,. . . , ud)}

m  kp



= 0  -0 1  i 

-p 1(uj)

p=1

j=kp-1+1

(6)

for 0-1  p  {w : [0; )  [0; )|w(0) = 0; w() = ; (-1)j-1w(j)  0; j = 1, . . . , }, p = 1, . . . , m, with k0 = 1. In contrast to the Archimedean copula, HAC defines the whole dependency structure in a recursive way. At the lowest level the depen-
dency between the first two variables is modelled by a copula function with the generator 1, i.e. z1 = C(u1, u2) = 1{-1 1(u1) + 1-1(u2)}. At the second level an another copula function is used to model the dependency between z1 and u3, etc. Note, that the generators i can come from the same family and differ only through the parameter or, to introduce more flexibility, come from different generator families. As an alternative to the
fully nested model, we can consider copula functions, with arbitrarily chosen combinations
at each copula level. Okhrin, Okhrin and Schmid (2008) provide several methodologies of
determining the structure of the HAC from the data, Okhrin, Okhrin and Schmid (2009)
provide necessary theoretical properties of HAC, there are also several empirical papers
on the application HAC to CDO (see Choros, H®ardle and Okhrin (2009)) and to weather
data (see Filler, Odening, Okhrin and Xu (2010)).

4 Simulation Techniques
To investigate the properties of some multivariate distributions, one needs the algorithms of the simulations because many of those properties are to be checked by Monte Carlo techniques. In this section we provide different methods of sampling from copula.
4.1 Conditional Inverse Method
The conditional inverse method is a general approach for the simulation of random variables from an arbitrary multivariate distribution. This method can be also used to simulate from copulae. The idea is to generate random variables recursively from the conditional distributions. To sample U1, . . . , Ud from copula C we proceed with the following steps
1. sample V1, . . . , Vd from U (0, 1); 2. U1 = V1;

13

3. Uj = Cj-1(Vj|U1, . . . , Uj-1) for j = 2, . . . , d where the conditional distribution of Uj is given by

Cj(uj|u1, . . . , uj-1) = P (Uj  uj|U1 = u1 . . . Uj-1 = uj-1)
j-1Cj (u1,...,uj )
= u1...uj-1
 j -1 Cj -1 (u1 ,...,uj -1 ) u1...uj-1
with Cj = C(u1, . . . , uj, 1, . . . , 1) = C(u1, . . . , uj).

(7)

The approach is numerically expensive, due to high order derivatives of C and the calculation of the inverse of the conditional distribution function.

4.2 Marshall and Olkin (1988) Method
To simulate from Archimedean copulae a simpler method was introduced in Marshall and Olkin (1988). The idea of the method is based on the fact that Archimedean copulae are derived from Laplace transforms (4). Following Marshall and Olkin (1988) we proceed with the following three steps procedure:
1. sample U from M = LS-1();
2. sample independent (V1, . . . , Vd)  U [0, 1];
3. Uj = {- ln(Vj)/U } for j = 1, . . . , d.
This method works much faster than the classic conditional inverse technique. The drawback is that the distribution M can only be determined explicitly for a few generator functions . For example for Gumbel copula M () = St(1/, 1, [cos{/(2)}]) and for Clayton copula M () = (1/, 1).

4.3 McNeil (2008) Method
Methods of simulation from the different HAC structures were proposed in McNeil (2008); this is an extension of the Marshall and Olkin (1988) method. Below is the algorithm for partially nested copulae (6)
1. sample U from M = LS-1(0); 2. for i = 1, . . . , m sample
Vkp-1+1, . . . , Vkp from C[ukp-1+1, . . . , ukp; exp{-U -0 1  p(∑)}] using Marshall and Olkin (1988) method where
C[ukp-1+1, . . . , ukp; exp{-U -0 1  p(∑)}] is the simple Archimedean copula with the generator function given by exp{-U -0 1 p(∑)};
14

3. (Ukp-1+1, . . . , Ukp) = 0[- log{(Vkp-1+1, . . . , Vkp)}/U ], p = 1, . . . , m.
This method, however also has some drawbacks because the inverse Laplace transform of the composition of the generator function does not always have an explicit form. Nevertheless, McNeil (2008) provides a list of combinations, which enable this.

5 Estimation

For a given data-set one needs to find an appropriate model, and to estimate the parameter
when the model is fixed. In this section we describe different methods of the estimation
of the copula from the data. All methods are similar and are based on the equation (2).
Having the sample Xij, i = 1, . . . , n, j = 1, . . . , d one needs to estimate the copula. To estimate the marginal distributions F^j(∑), j = 1, . . . , d at least three possible methods are available. The most simple one is to use the empirical distribution function

F^j (x)

n I{Xij

the

empirical distribution from 1; otherwise this causes problems in the maximum likelihood

(ML) calculation. The inverse function of F^j(x) is then an empirical quantile. Instead

of this simplest empirical estimation one can smooth the distribution function by using a kernel method, see H®ardle and Linton (1994). Using kernel function  : R  R,  = 1

with the bandwidth h > 0 one gets following estimator

with

Apart

from

nonparametric

methods,

there

is

also

a

parametric

method that is based on the assumption of a parametric form of the marginal distribution

Fj(x, ^j), where j is the parameter of the distribution, and ^j is its estimator based on the ML method or method of moments. The last case considers the full knowledge of the

true marginal distribution Fj(x), which is rare in practice.

In the same way, there are four possible choices of the copula function. Let us first determine general margins Fj(x) that could be one of F^j(x), F~j(x), Fj(x, ^) or Fj(x).
The empirical copula is then defined as

C(u1, . . . , ud)

=

1 n

n d I{Fj (Xij )



uj }.

i=1 j=1

(8)

Let Kj, j = 1, . . . , d be the same symmetric kernel for each direction as in the estimation of marginal distributions, and let hj, j = 1, . . . , d be the set of bandwidths, then the kernel based copula estimation considered in Fermanian and Scaillet (2003) is

{}

1 n d

C(u1, . . . , ud) = n

Kj

i=1 j=1

uj - Fj(Xij) hj

.

(9)

15

In the bivariate case (d = 2) to avoid boundary bias, one uses (Chen and Huang, 2007) local linear kernel to smooth at u  [0, 1]

Kuh

=

K(x){a2(u, h) - a1(u, h)x} a0(u, h)a2(u, h) - a12(u, h)

,

 = 0, 1, Kuh(x)dx

2 and h and Tuh

> =

0 (see Lejeune and Sarda (1992), Guh{(u - 1)/h}, then an unbiased

kernel based estimator of the bivariate copula is given by

{ }{ }

1 C(u1, u2) = n Gu1h

u1 - F1(Xi1) h

Gu2h

u2 - F2(Xi2) h

- (u1Tu2h + u2Tu1h + Tu1hTu2h).

(10)

The last situation is the parametric copula C(u, ), where the copula comes from some fixed family. In this case the parameter of the copula function is estimated using the ML method. From (3) the likelihood function for the case Fj(x) = Fj(x, j), j = 1, . . . , d is
n L(, 1, . . . , d) = f (Xi1, . . . , Xid; 1, . . . , d, )
i=1
and the log-likelihood function is given by

n

(, 1, . . . , d) =

log c{F1(Xi1; 1), . . . , Fd(Xid; d); }

i=1

n d + log fj(Xij; j),

i=1 j=1

where fj(∑) are marginal densities. All parameters {, 1, . . . , d} can be estimated in one or two steps. For practical applications, however, a two step estimation procedure is more efficient. A one step procedure, also called full maximum likelihood, is carried out by maximising likelihood function simultaneously over all parameters, thus by solving
(/1, . . . , /d, /) = 0,
with respect to (, 1, . . . , d). Following the standard theory on ML estimation estimators are efficient and asymptotically normal. However, it is often computationally demanding to solve the system simultaneously.
The two step procedure can be done for any kind of marginal distribution Fj(x)  {Fj(x), Fj(x), Fj(x, ^)}. Firstly, we estimate the marginal distribution by using any of the above methods and secondly, we estimate the copula parameter by the pseudo loglikelihood function
n p() = log c{F1(Xi1), . . . , Fd(Xid); }.
i=1

16

The solution is then
^ = arg max p().

If the marginal distributions are from parametric families Fj(x) = Fj(x, ^j), j = 1, . . . , d, then the method is called inference for margins. Otherwise, if margins, are nonparametrically estimated Fj(x)  {Fj(x), Fj(x)}, j = 1, . . . , d, then the method is called canonical maximum likelihood method.
6 Goodness-of-Fit (GoF) Tests
After the copula is estimated, one needs to test how well the estimated copula describes the sample. Nonparametric copula is certainly the best choice for this, and is usually considered the benchmark in many tests. With the GoF tests one checks whether the underlying copula belongs to any copula family. The test problem could be written as a composite null hypothesis
H0 : C  C0, against H1 : C / C0,
where C0 = {C :   } is a known parametric family of copulae. In some cases we restrict ourselves to the one element family C0 = C0, thus the hypothesis in this case in the simple one. The test problem is, in general, equivalent to the GoF tests for multivariate distributions. However, since the margins are estimated we cannot apply the standard test procedures directly.
Here we consider several methodologies recently introduced in the literature. We can categorised them into three classes: tests based on the empirical copula, tests based on the Kendall's process and tests based on Rosenblatt's transform.
6.1 Tests based on the empirical copula
These tests are based directly on the distance between C and C0. Naturally, as C is unknown one takes the empirical copula which is fully nonparametric C^ or C~ instead. The estimated copula C0, that should be tested, is the parametric one C(∑, ^). Two statistics considered in the literature (see e.g Fermanian (2005), Genest and R¥emillard (2008), etc.) are similar to Cr¥amer-von Mises and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistics
 S = n {C(u1, . . . , ud) - C(u1, . . . , ud, )}2 dC(u1, . . . , ud),
[0,1]d
 T = sup n|C(u1, . . . , ud) - C(u1, . . . , ud, )|.
u1,...,ud[0,1]
 Genest and R¥emillard (2008) show the convergence of n{C(u1, . . . , ud)-C(u1, . . . , ud, )} in distribution, they also show that tests based on S and T are consistent. In actual fact, the p-values of the test statistics depends on this limiting distribution and in practice p-values are calculated using the bootstrap methods described in Genest and R¥emillard (2008). This is quite expensive numerically, but leads to proper results.
17

6.2 Tests based on Kendall's process

Genest and Rivest (1993), Wang and Wells (2000) and Barbe, Genest, Ghoudi and
R¥emillard (1996) consider a test based on the true and empirical distributions of the pseudo random variable V = C(U1, . . . , Ud)  K. The expectation of v is the transformation of the multivariate extension of Kendall's  , hence the deviation of the true K and empirical K^ as a univariate function is called Kendall's process. The most natural
empirical estimation of K is

K^ (v)

=

1 n

n I{Vi



v}.

i=1

The theoretical form of the K was discussed in Barbe et al. (1996), Okhrin et al. (2009) for different copula functions. In the bivariate case of the Archimedean copulae it is related to the generator function as

K (v,

)

=

v

-

- 1(v) {-1(v)}

.

As in the tests based on the empirical copulae Wang and Wells (2000) and Genest et al. (2006) propose to compute a Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Cr¥amer-von-Mises statistics for the K

1 SK = n {K^ (v) - K(v, )}2 dv,
0
TK = sup |K^ (v) - K(v, )|,
v[0,1]

where K^ (v) and K(v, ) are empirical and theoretical K-distributions of the variable v = C(u1, . . . , ud). However, as in the previous tests, exact p-values for this statistic cannot be computed explicitly. Savu and Trede (2004) propose a 2-test based on the K-distribution. Unfortunately, in most cases the distribution of the test statistic does not follow a standard distribution and either a bootstrap or another computationally intensive methods should be used.

6.3 Tests based on Rosenblatt's process

An alternative global approach is based on the probability integral transform introduced in Rosenblatt (1952) and applied in Breymann et al. (2003), Chen et al. (2004) and Dobri¥c and Schmid (2007). The idea of the transformation is to construct the variables

Yi1 = F1(Xi1), Yij = C{Fj(Xij)|F1(Xi1), . . . , Fj-1(Xi,j-1)}, for j = 2, . . . , d,

(11)

where the conditional copula is defined in (7). Under H0 the variables Yij, for j = 1, . . . , d are independently and uniformly distributed on the interval [0, 1]. Here we discuss the
18

et 

al. 2d.

(2004). Consider Breymann et al.

the variable Wi = (2003) assume that

estimating margins and copula parameters does not significantly affect the distribution

of W^ i and apply a standard 2 test directly to the pseudo-observations. Chen et al.

(2004) developed a kernel-based test for the distribution of W and, thus, an account for

estimation errors. Let g~W (w) denote the kernel estimator of the density of W . Under

H0 the density gW (w) is a measure of divergency

equal Chen

aol.ne(,20a0s4)thueseddenJs^nity=of 01t{hg~eWu(nwif)o-rm1}d2idstwri.buAtisosnu.miAngs

non-parametric estimator of the marginal distributions Chen et al. (2004) prove under

regularity conditions that

 Tn = (n hJ^n - cn)/  N (0, 1),

where the normalisation parameters h, cn and  are defined in Chen et al. (2004). The proof of this statement does not depend explicitly on the type of the non-parametric estimator of the marginals Fj, but uses the order of Fj(Xij) - Fj(Xij) as a function of n. It can be shown that if the parametric families of marginal distributions are correctly
specified and their parameters are consistently estimated, then the statement also holds
if we use parametric estimators for marginal distributions.

7 Simulation Study
A Monte Carlo experiment has been provided to discuss the finite sample properties of the goodness-of-fit tests based on the empirical copula and different estimation techniques on the simulated data. We restrict ourselves to the three dimensional case of three copula families, namely Gaussian, simple AC with Gumbel generator and HAC with Gumbel generator. For the simulation from the AC we use the Marshall and Olkin (1988) method and for simulation from HAC the McNeil (2008) method. To simulate from the Gaussian copula we simulate first from normal distribution and then apply the Sklar's theorem (1).
The main characteristic of interest in this study is to see whether the tests are able to maintain their nominal level fixed at  = 0.1 and to see the power of the tests under the variety of alternatives. This is the only study that discusses the power of goodness-of-fit tests for copula in dimensions higher that d = 2. We consider all possible copulae with parameters   {0.25, 0.5, 0.75}. This means that under consideration were three AC: C(0.25)(∑), C(0.5)(∑), C(0.75)(∑), three HAC: C(0.25){C(0.50)(u1, u2), u3}, C(0.25){C(0.75)(u1, u2), u3}, C(0.75){C(0.50)(u1, u2), u3}, and 15 Gaussian copulae with all possible positive definite correlation matrices containing values   {0.25, 0.5, 0.75}. Here ( ) converts Kendall's  correlation coefficient into a corresponding copula parameter.
The results are provided in Table 1 for AC, in Table 2 for HAC and in Table 4 for Gaussian copulae. To save the workspace we provide results for only 3 Gaussian copulae out of 15 with the largest difference between parameters. For HAC, a vector function (1, 2) converts two Kendall's  into HAC copula parameters. If 1 < 2 then copula C(1){C(2)(u1, u2), u3} is considered. For Gaussian copula

sian copula with upper diagonal elements of the correlation matrix given by  = (0.25, 0.25, 0.75)

20

From each copula we simulate a sample of n = 50 or n = 150 observations with standard normal margins. The margins are then estimated parametrically (normal distribution with estimated mean and variance) or nonparametrically. Respective columns in the tables are marked by "par." and "emp.". For each sample we estimate the AC using inference for the margins method, HAC using Okhrin et al. (2008) and the Gaussian copula using the generalised method of moments. Then we test how good these distributions fit the sample. The empirical copula for both tests has been calculated as in (8). Number of bootstrap steps provided for the tests is equal to N = 1000. To sum up the simulation procedure, we used
1. F : two methods of estimation of margins (parametric and nonparametric);
2. C0 : hypothesised copula models under H0 (three models);
3. C : copula model from which the data were generated (three models with 3, 3 and 15 levels of dependence respectively);
4. n : size of each sample drawn from C (two possibilities, n = 50 and n = 150).
Thus, for all these 2 ◊ 3 ◊ (3 + 3 + 15) ◊ 2 = 252 situations we perform 100 repetitions in order to calculate the power of both tests. This study is hardly comparable to other similar studies, because, as far as we know, this is the only one that considers the three dimensional case, and the only one that considers a hierarchical Archimedean copulae.
To understand the numbers in the tables more deeply let us consider first the value in Table 1. The number 0.88 says, that testing using Kolmogorov-Smirnov type statistic Tn for the AC with  = 0.25 from the sample of a size n = 50, with nonparametrically estimated margins, rejects the null hypotheses H0, assuming that the data are from HAC, in 100% - 88% = 12% of chances. It is very natural that the rejection rate for the AC, that have HAC under H0, is very close to the case, where AC is under H0. In general AC is a special case of HAC. If the true distribution is AC, the rejection rates should be equal, or close to each other, and the difference based only on the estimation error.
Figure 6 represents the level of both goodness-of-fit tests for different sizes in terms of three quartiles; the outliers are marked with closed dots. In general, values lies below 0.1, which implies that the bootstrap performs well. Increasing the number of runs improves this graph. We see that if the sample size has enlarged three times, then the tests have approximately doubled their power in S statistics, and a slightly smaller coefficient is given for the T statistics. In general, small size samples from different models look very similar (see Figure 5), this makes detection of the model that best fits the data hardly applicable, this also explains a lot of outliers in Figure 6.
From the tables we see, that Sn performs, on average, better than Tn statistics, this can be also seen from the Figure 6. In the tables, rejection rates for Sn under false H0 are in general higher, than for Tn statistics. We can also conclude that the larger the difference between parameters of the model is the faster AC is rejected. This can be expressed by the only parameter in AC that does not covers the whole dependency.

8 Empirical Results

The empirical part of this study is based on the calculation of the Value-at-Risk for the Profit and Loss function of the portfolio containing three assets. Asset returns follow some GARCH-type process with residuals from copula based models. We consider the daily stock prices of three American banks, namely Bank of America, Citigroup and Santander from 29.09.2000 to 16.02.2001. This results in T = 100 observations being consistent with the simulation study provided above. We take this time interval because several U.S. banks have recorded strong earnings in the fourth quarter of 2000. Rising profits were reported by U.S. industry leaders, namely Citigroup and Bank of America. At the same time bad forecasts for technology companies were reported; these influence the financial sector as well. Prices {Xtj}, j = 1, 2, 3 behave (over the chosen period) as in Figure 7. Assuming the log-returns Rtj = log(Xtj/Xt-1,j), j = 1, 2, 3, t = 1, . . . , T (see Figure 8) follow an ARMA(1,1)-GARCH(1,1) process, we have

Rtj = µj + j Rt-1,j + j t-1,j t-1,j + tj tj ,

where

t2j = j + j t2-1,j + j t2-1,j 2t-1,j

and  > 0, j  0, j  0, j + j < 1, || < 1.
The fit of an ARMA(1,1)-GARCH(1,1) model to the log returns Rt = (Rt1, Rt2, Rt3), T = 100, gives the estimates ^j, ^j, ^j, ^j and ^j, as in Table 5. Empirical residuals {^t}tT=1, where ^t = (^t1, ^t2, ^t3) are assumed to be normally distributed; this is not rejected by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test at the high level of significance for all three banks. Residuals are also assumed to be independent, because of the Box-Ljung autocorrelation test with lag 12. Thus, in the estimation of copula we use an inference for margins method, where margins are normal, thus, estimated parametrically.

Upper diagonal cells of Figure 9 represent pair wise scatterplots of ARMA-GARCH resid-
uals. In the lower diagonal cells of the same figure we show the scatterplots of the residuals mapped on the unit square by the estimated marginal cdf, F^(^).

We estimated three different models, namely simple AC, HAC and Gaussian copula. Afterwards two tests, used in the simulation study, were applied to see how good these models describe data. In this case the number of bootstrap runs has been increased to N = 10000 to make the test results more precise. Estimated models, and p-values are represented in Table 6. We see that parameters in the HAC model deviate from each other, we may conclude therefore, that a simple AC is not a proper model that fits the data. On the other hand, from Figure 9 we see that the points are not elliptical; this convinces us to expect a low p-value of the test where the Gaussian copula is under H0. In the first two columns of Table 6 we put p-values for all tests. We conclude that HAC is the most appropriate model for this particular dataset, because it has the largest pvalue. Based on two tests only HAC can not be rejected under significance level  = 0.05. This means that our data may not be described by the simple three-dimensional normal distribution, but the margins are still normal.

To see if knowledge of preferable distribution is worth knowing in a financial problem, we estimate the Vale-at-Risk from a Profit and Loss of a linear portfolio using copulae. The portfolio is composed of the stocks discussed above. We also perform an evaluation of the estimators through backtesting. Let w be the portfolio, which is represented by the number of assets for a specified stock in the portfolio, w = {w1, . . . , wd}, wi  Z. The value Vt of the portfolio w is given by

d Vt = wjXtj
j=1

(13)

also called profit and loss (P&L) function, expresses the absolute change in the portfolio value in one period. The distribution function of L, dropping the time index, is given by

FL(x) = P (L  x).

(14)

As usual the Value-at-Risk at level  from a portfolio w is defined as the -quantile from FL:

VaR() = FL-1().

(15)

It follows from (14) that FL depends on the d-dimensional distribution of log-returns FX. In general, the loss distribution FL depends on a random process representing the risk factors influencing the P&L from a portfolio. In the present case log-returns modelled by
an ARMA(1,1)-GARCH(1,1) model are a suitable risk factor choice. Thus, modelling their
distribution is essential to obtain the quantiles from FL. To estimate the VaR we simulate samples of residuals t from HAC, AC and Gaussian copula with normal margins, then apply simulated residuals to the estimated ARMA(1,1)-GARCH(1,1) model and calculate it based on the values of the Profit and Loss L^ with w = (1, 1, 1). The V aR() is then an empirical -quantile from the L^. In Figure 10 we represent the series of estimated
Value-at-Risk with  = 0.1 and the P&L function. Afterwards backtesting is used to

The backtesting results are provided in Table 7. From them we see that the Gaussian copula usually underestimates the VaR. This is natural because this copula does not have nor upper nor a lower tail dependence. The simple Archimedean copula overestimates the VaR. Results provided by HAC are the closest to the true ones, but this copula underestimates the true VaR in all levels of significance. This is also natural because Gumbel copula describes wins rather than losses best. In general these results were expected due to the fact, that HAC is the only copula that was accepted by both tests under a high level of significance.

9 Conclusions
In this chapter we gave a short survey on copulae. We discussed different copula classes, methods of simulation and estimation and several goodness-of-fit tests. We provided an extensive simulation study in which two goodness-of-fit tests and two estimation techniques were considered. Afterwards, copulae were applied to de-GARCHed real world time-series. From the empirical study we conclude that, in some cases, even if margins are normal, the dependency is certainly not linearly normal, and more flexible dependency models are asked for.
