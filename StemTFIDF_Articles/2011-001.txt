Abstract
On the temperature derivative market, modeling temperature volatility is an important issue for pricing and hedging. In order to apply pricing tools of nancial mathematics, one needs to isolate a Gaussian risk factor. A conventional model for temperature dynamics is a stochastic model with seasonality and inter temporal autocorrelation. Empirical work based on seasonality and autocorrelation correction reveals that the obtained residuals are heteroscedastic with a periodic pattern. The object of this research is to estimate this heteroscedastic function so that after scale normalisation a pure standardised Gaussian variable appears. Earlier work investigated this temperature risk in dierent locations and showed that neither parametric component functions nor a local linear smoother with constant smoothing parameter are exible enough to generally describe the volatility process well. Therefore, we consider a local adaptive modeling approach to nd at each time point, an optimal smoothing parameter to locally estimate the seasonality and volatility. Our approach provides a more exible and accurate tting procedure of localised temperature risk process by achieving excellent normal risk factors.

1 Introduction

Pricing of contingent claims based on stochastic dynamics for example stocks or FX rates is well known in nancial engineering. An elegant access of such a pricing task is based on self-nancing replication arguments. An essential element of this approach is the tradability of the underlying. This however does not apply to weather derivatives contingent on temperature or rain since the underlying is not tradable. In this context, the proposed pricing techniques are based on either equilibrium ideas (Horst and Mueller (2007)) or econometric modelling of the underlying dynamics (Campbell and Diebold (2005) and Benth, Benth and Koekebakker (2007)) followed by risk neutral pricing.
The equilibrium approach relies on assumptions about preferences (with explicitly known functional forms) though. In this study we prefer a phenomenological approach since the underlying (temperature) we consider is of local nature and our analysis aims at understanding the pricing at dierent locations and dierent time points around the world. Such a time series approach has been taken by Benth et al. (2007), who corrects for seasonality (in mean), then for intertemporal correlation and nally as in Campbell and Diebold (2005), for seasonal variation in volatility. After these manipulations a Gaussian risk factor needs to be isolated in order to apply continuous time pricing techniques, Karatzas and Shreve (2001).
Empirical studies following this econometrical route show evidence that the resulting risk factor deviates severely from Gaussianity, which in turn challenges the pricing tools, Benth, Härdle and López Cabrera (2011). In particular, for Asian cities, like for example Kaohsiung (Taiwan), one observes very distinctive non-normality in the form of clearly visible heavy tails caused by extended volatility in peak seasons. This is visible from Figure 1 where a log density plot reveals a nonnormal
shoulder structure (kurtosis= 3.22, skewness= -0.08, JB= 128.74).

The upper panel of Figure 2 displays the seasonality and deseasonalised residuals over two years in Kaohsiung. The lower panel RHS displays the empirical and seasonal variance function, while the lower panel LHS shows the smoothed seasonal variance function over years. The series expansion (1), (2) failed though in the volatility peak seasons. Even incorporating an asymmetry term for the dip of temperature in winter does not improve the closeness to normality.

One may of course pursue a ne tuning of (1) and (2) with more and more periodic terms but this
will increase the number of parameters. We therefore propose a local parametric approach. The
 seasonality s and s are approximated with a Local Linear Regression (LLR) estimator:

where T¯t is the mean (over years) of daily averages temperatures, ^2t the squared residual process (after seasonal and intertemporal tting), h the bandwidth and K (·) is a kernel. Note, that due to

the spherical character of the data, the kernel weights in (3), (4) may be calculated from wrapped
around observations thereby avoiding bias. The estimates ^ s, ^s2 are given by the minimisers e^s, g^s of (3), (4). The upper panel of Figure 2 shows the seasonality in mean and the bottom panel
on the RHS the volatility estimated with Fourier series and local linear regression using the quartic

kernel. We observe high variance in winter and early summer and low variance in spring and late

summer.

The scale correction of the obtained residuals (after seasonal and intertemporal tting) is appar-

ently not identical over the year. A very structured volatility pattern up to April is followed by

a moderately constant period until an increasing peak starting in September. This motivates our

research to localise temperature risk. The local smoothness of

2 t

is

of

course

not

only

a

matter

of one location (here Kaohsiung) but varies also over the dierent cities around the world that we

are analysing in this study. Our study is local in a double sense: local in time and space. We

use adaptive methods to localise the underlying dynamics and with that being able to achieve

Gaussian risk factors. This will justify the pricing via standard tools that are based on Gaussian
hrisk drivers. The localisation in time is based on adjusting the smoothing parameter . For a

general framework on local parametric approximation we refer to Spokoiny (2009). As a result we

obtain better approximations to normality and therefore less biased prices.

This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the localising approach. In section 3, we present the data and conduct the analysis to dierent cities. Section 4 presents an application

R. The temperature data for dierent cities in US, Europe and Asia were obtained from the Na-
tional Climatic Data Center (NCDC), the Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD), Bloomberg Professional Service and the Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA).

2 Model

Let us change our notation from t  (t, j), with t = 1, . . . ,  = 365 days, j = 0, . . . , J years. The
time series decomposition we consider is given as:

X365j+t = Tt,j - t,

L

X365j+t =

lj X365j+t-l + t,j ,

l=1
t,j = tet,j,

et,j  N(0, 1),

L

^t,j = X365j+t -

^lj X365j+t-l,

l=1

(5)

where Tt,j is the temperature at day t in year j, t denotes the seasonality eect and t the seasonal
volatility. Motivation of this modeling approach can be found in Diebold and Inoue (2001). Later

studies like e.g. Campbell and Diebold (2005) and Benth et al. (2007) have provided evidence that
 jthe parameters lj are likely to be independent and hence estimated consistently from a global autoregressive process model AR(Lj ) with Lj = L. Since the stylised facts of temperature are  re-occurring every year, our focus is on exible estimation of t and t2, see Figure 2.

the resulting normalised residuals. The commonly used approaches 1. truncated Fourier series, 2.

local polynomial regression are both too restrictive and do not t the data well since they are not

yielding normal risk factors. These observations motivate us to consider a more exible approach.

The main idea is to t a simple parametric model locally for the trend and variance with adaptively

chosen window sizes. Specically, we use kernel smoothing and adopt an adaptive technique to

choose the bandwidth over days. Other examples of this technique can be found in Cízek, Härdle

and Spokoiny (2009) and Chen, Härdle and Pigorsch (2010).

2.1 How does the adaptation work?
The time series Tt,j are approximated at a xed time point s  [1, 365]. Our goal is to nd a local
window that follows certain optimality properties to be dened below. Specically, for a specied weight sequence, we conduct a sequential LRT to choose an appropriate bandwidth. Dierent procedures of estimating seasonality and volatility are studied. Suppose that the object to be
approximated is the seasonal variance (t) = {t2}. A weighted maximum likelihood approach is

with the localising scheme W k(s) = {w(s, 1, hk), w(s, 2, hk), . . . , w(s, 365, hk)} , where w(s, t, hk) = hk-1K{(s - t)/hk}, k = 1, . . . , K, h1 < h2 < h3 < . . . < hK the prescribed sequence of bandwidths, and K(u) = 15/16(1 - u2)2I(|u|  1) (quartic kernel).

The explicit solution of (6) is given by:

~k(s) = ^t2,jw(s, t, hk)/ w(s, t, hk)

>From a smoothing perspective we are in a comfortable situation here since the boundary bias
is not an issue, as we are dealing with a periodic function (t) = (t + 365). We use mirrored
observations: assume hK < 365/2, then the observation set, for example for the seasonal volatility, is extended to ^2-364, ^-2 363, . . . , ^02, ^21, . . . , ^7230, where

^2t d=ef ^2365+t, -364  t  0, ^2t d=ef ^2t-365, 366  t  730.

, the accuracy of the estimation is measured by the tted likelihood ratio (LR):

L(W , ~ , ~k) d=ef L(W , ~ ) - L(W , ~k).
 The volatility t or trend t estimation happens within an exponential family, so LR can be written
in closed form, Polzehl and Spokoiny (2006):

L(W k, ~k, ) d=ef NkK(~k, ) = -{log(~k/) + 1 - /~k}/2,

To guarantee the feasibility of the tests, we need moment bounds and condence sets for LR, which guarantee that the MLE is concentrated in the level set of the likelihood ratio process around the true parameter. For the volatility case, see Polzehl and Spokoiny (2006); for the trend case, see Mercurio and Spokoiny (2004).

Theorem 2.1 [Spokoiny (2009)] Assuming that (t) =  for any t  [1, 365], then for z > 0 and k  1, . . . , K, r > 0, denote P(.) as the measure corresponding to (6). We obtain:

P L(W k, ~k, ) > z  2 exp (-z)

(8)

and a risk bound for a power loss function:

E |L(W k, ~k, )|r  rr,

(9)

where rr = 2r z0 zr-1 exp(-z)dz. This polynomial bound applies to all localising schemes W k
simultaneously.

The risk bound (9) allows us to dene likelihood based condence sets since together with (8) it

tells us that the likelihood process is stochastically bounded. Dene therefore condence sets with

critical values zk to level :

E,k = { : L(W k, ~k, )  zk}.

(10)

Equipped with condence sets (10), we launch the Local Model Selection (LMS) algorithm:

· Fix a point s  {1, 2, . . . , 365}. · hStart with the smallest interval 1: ^1 = ~1 · For k  2, ~k is accepted and ^k = ~k if ~k-1 was accepted and ~  E,k,  = 1, . . . , k - 1,
i.e.
L(W k, ~ , ~k)  z ,  = 1, . . . , k - 1.
Otherwise, set ^k = ^k-1, where ^k is the latest accepted after rst k steps. · Dene k^ as the kth step we stopped, and ^ = ~k^,  k.
~The LMS algorithm is illustrated in Figure 3. For every estimate k the corresponding condence ~set is shown. If the horizontal line originating k does not cross all the preceding intervals then
the selection algorithm terminates.
A further integrated approach is to consider an iterative algorithm to cope with heteroscedasticity in the corrected residuals after seasonality in mean and variance component varies between
estimating the seasonal component and the variance (t) = {t, t2}. The procedure is:

Step 4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 till both |^ t,+1 - ^ t, | < 1 and |^t2,+1 - ^t2, | < 2 for some constants 1 and 2.

Our empirical implementation suggests that one iteration is enough.

zThe LMS methods requires critical values k, which dene the signicance for the LRT statistics L(W , ~ , ~k) or alternatively speaking the length of the condence interval (see (8)) at each step.
The critical values are calibrated from the propagation condition below which ensures a desired
k ^level of type one error. To be more specic, for every step , dene k as the survived estimator after the kth step (if the estimator is not rejected up to step k, then ^k = ~k, else if the estimator has been rejected at step l < k, then ^k = ~l). Measure the closeness of ~k and ^k by:

E |L(W k, ~k, ^k)|r  rr

(11)

8

for k = 1, . . . , K with rr the parametric risk bound in (9) and  a control parameter corresponding
to the type one error. In fact
E |L(W k, ~k, ^k)|r  P(~k = ^k)
for r  0, therefore  can be interpreted as a false alarm probability. More precisely if step k is accepted as described in Figure 3 then ~k = ^k and the nonzero loss
E L(W k, ~k, ^k) can only occur if the estimator has been rejected before or at step k, which under
the homogeneous parametric model case, is denoted as false alarm.
With the propagation condition (13) below, critical values are constructed.

· Consider rst z1 and let z2 = z3 = . . . = zK-1 = . This leads to the estimates ^k(z1) and zthe value 1 is selected as the minimal one for which

(13) ensures that every zk has the same impact. The values of (, r, h1, . . . , hK ) are prespecied

hyper-parameters of which robustness and sensitivity issues will be discussed in Section 3. The

zfollowing theorem provides insight into the form of k.

Theorem 2.2 [Spokoiny (2009)] Suppose that 0 < hk-1/hk < 1 and (t) =  for all t  [0, 365]. An upper bound for the critical values zk is given by:
zk = a0 log K + 2 log(nhk/) + 2r log(hK/hk)
where a0 > 0 is a constant.

A risk bound for a global model ((t) = ) has been given in (11). This may now be extended to
the nonparametric setting via the Small Modeling Bias (SMB) condition:

365
() d=ef K(t, ) I{w(s, t, hk) > 0}  , k < k,
t=1
k kwhere  is the maximum satisfying (14), also called oracle.

(14)

The estimation risk for the function (t) is described for k  k by the propagation property:
E (·) log{1 + |L(W k, ~k, ^k)|r/rr}   + .

9

k ^An estimate for  is desired. The adaptive estimate k^ will in fact enjoy this property as we show below. The estimate ^k^ behaves similarly to the oracle estimate ~k since it is stable in the k ^sense that even if the described selection scheme overshoots , the resulting estimate k^ is still ~close to the oracle k . This may be expressed as that the attained quality of estimation during
propagation is not lost at further steps:
L(W k, ~k, ^k^) I{k^ > k}  zk.

A combination of the propagation and stability property then leads to the oracle property:

E (·) log

1 + |L(W k, ~k, )|r rr

E (·) log

1 + |L(W k, ~k, ^k^)|r rr

  + 1,   +  + log

1 + zk rr

,

for    with (W k, )   and k  k. This means that the risk of estimating adaptively is
composed into three parts: the SMB, the false alarm rate and a small term corresponding to the overshooting risk.

3 Empirical analysis
We conduct an empirical analysis of temperature patterns over dierent cities (Figure 4). The data set contains daily average temperatures for dierent cities in Europe, Asia and US: Atlanta, Beijing, Berlin, Essen, Houston, Kaoshiung, New York, Osaka, Portland, Taipei, Tokyo. The summary of the data and characteristics can be seen in Table 1.

warming. The latter coecients are stable even when the estimation is done in a window length of 10 years. In the sense of capturing volatility peak seasons, the left panel of Figure 5 visualises the power of capturing volatility peak seasons by the seasonal local smoother (3) using the quartic kernel over the estimates modeled under Fourier truncated series (1).

Table 3: Skewness, kurtosis, Jarque Bera (JB), Kolmogorov Smirnov (KS) and Anderson Darling
(AD) test statistics (365 days) of corrected residuals.
¡

X =After removing the local linear seasonal mean (3) from the daily average temperatures ( t Tt - t,LN N ), we check that Xt is a stationary process with the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF)
and the KPSS tests. The analysis of the partial autocorrelations and Akaike's Information criterion
(AIC) suggest that a simple AR(3) model ts the temperature evolution well. Table 1 presents the results of the stationarity tests as well as the coecients of the tted AR(3). The empirical
seasonal variation (square residuals after seasonal and intertemporal tting), the seasonal variation curves (2) and (4) are displayed on the right panel in Figure 5, while the descriptive statistics for the residuals after correcting by seasonality are given in Table 3. Both seasonal volatility estimators lead to heavy tail distributions of corrected residuals and negative skewness.
hThe adjustment in the smoothing parameter will provide the localisation in time. The bandwidth sequences are selected from four candidates: (3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15), (3, 5, 8, 12, 17, 23, 30), (5, 7, 10, 14, 19, 25, 32), (7, 9, 11, 14, 17, 10, 24). The candidates are chosen according to the low-
est Anderson Darling statistic. The best candidate for bandwidth sequence is that one that yields a residual distribution close to normality. Smoothing the bandwidths selected at discrete points, gives yet another adaptive estimator.
The critical values (CV) as calibrated from (12) and (13) are given in Figure 6. The left side
10provides CVs simulated from a sample of 3 observations for a quartic kernel for both mean and volatility with  = 1, r = 0.5 and dierent values of signicance level . The CVs for dierent
bandwidth sequences are displayed in the right side of Figure 6. The CVs, as one observes, are
insensitive to the choice of r and .
A one year short period is considered in the rst place for demonstration purpose, while later we show how the results change with dierent time length periods. Figures 7, 8, 9 and 10 present general results for dierent cities under dierent adaptive localising schemes for seasonal mean (Me) and seasonal volatility (Vo): with xed bandwidth curve (), adaptive bandwidth curve (ad) and adaptive smoothed bandwidth (ads) for dierent time intervals. The seasonal mean is
estimated jointly over the years, using  = 0.3 and power level r = 0.5. The upper panel of each
volatility plot on Figures 7-10 shows the sequence of bandwidths and the smoothed bandwidth; the bottom panel displays the variance estimation with xed bandwidth (dashed line), smoothed adaptive bandwidth (dotted line) and adaptive bandwidth (dot-dashed line). In all countries, one observes signicant dierences between the estimates. When smoothing the discrete bandwidths over time, the estimated variance curves are smoother. In particular, in cities like Kaohsiung and New York, one observes more variation of the seasonal variance curves during peak seasons (winter and summer times). The triangles and circles in the bottom panel of each volatility plot helps
10us to trace the source of non-normality over time, since they corresponds to dots of the upper
and lower tails of the QQ-plots of square residuals respectively (see Figure 11 for Berlin results).

dierent bandwidth sequences (right).

Left top plots of Figures 7- 10 show the mean case. Dierent from the seasonal variance function, we do not observe a big variation of smoothness in the mean function. One can see that in all cities, the bandwidths are varying over the yearly cycle with a slight degree of non homogeneity for Kaoshiung.

Figure 10: Estimation of mean and variance for Berlin. In each gure sequence (also smoothed for volatility) of bandwidths (upper panel), nonparametric function estimation (solid grey line), with xed bandwidth (dashed line), adaptive bandwidth (dot-dashed line) and smoothed adaptive bandwidth (dotted line) (bottom panel of each gure).

An approach to cope with the non normality brought in by more observations is to estimate mean functions year by year (SeMe), and then aggregate the residuals for variance estimation. We therefore estimate the joint/separate seasonal mean (JoMe/SeMe) and seasonal variance (Vo) curves with xed bandwidth curve (), adaptive bandwidth curve (ad) and adaptive smoothed
pbandwidth (ads). Table 5 and Table 6 show the -values for normality tests. Volatility plots
on the Figures 7-10 displays the behavior of the variance function estimation when the period length changes. The average over years acts as a smoother when we consider more years. The
estimated AR(L) parameters for dierent cities using joint/separate mean (JoMe/SeMe) with dierent bandwidth curves are illustrated in Table 4. The results again show that an AR(3) ts
well the stylised facts of temperature.
pThe -values of normality test statistics (Kolmogorov Smirnov KS, Jarques-Bera JB, Anderson
Darling AD) of corrected residuals (after seasonal mean and volatility) for dierent cities under varying localising schemes are displayed in Table 5 and Table 6. The results are compared for
dierent periods (3 years, 4 years, 5 years). pThe longer the period, the smaller the -value of
normality and therefore the more likely to reject the normality assumption. The standardised residuals are closer to normality (Berlin and New York) or at the same level (Kaoshiung and Tokyo)
poverall. The approach shows stability over more years. The -values for adaptive estimates, over
all cities, are generally larger than those for xed bandwidth estimates. We observe that in US cities the risk factor show a better Gaussian pattern compared to other cities. With smoothed bandwidth, there are a slightly improvements in some cases. In most of the cases, specially in cities at sea level, the correction by adaptive models outperforms the classical method.

We tackle the problem of loosing information when considering estimates at individual level or
averaging mean functions over time, with a rened approach that considers the minimum variance
between the aggregation of yearly local mean function estimates and an optimal local estimate o.
Once the sets of local mean functions have been identied, the aggregated local function can be
dened as the weighted average of all the observations in a given time set. Formally, if ^j (t) is the t jlocalised observation at time of year , the aggregated local function is given by:

J
^(t) = j^j(t).
j=1

(15)

JWith this aggregation step across , we give the same weight to all observations, even to obser-
vations that were unimportant at the yearly level. Then a reasonable optimised estimate will be:

J 365

J

{^(t) - ^jo(t)}2 subject to

j = 1; j > 0, j = 1, . . . , J,

papproaches with maximised -values over year. One may interpret this normalisation of weights as

an optimisation with respect to dierent frequencies (yearly, daily). Table 5 and Table 6 display the
presults of the aggregation over time (Locave, Locsep, Locmax). Although the -values decrease

when considering more years, the aggregation approach performs drastically better than other

approaches, especially in New York, because it weights more to extreme cases.

4 A temperature pricing example

Futures and options written on temperature indices are traded at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
(CME). Temperature futures are contracts written on dierent temperature indices measured over
specied periods [1, 2] like weeks, months or quarters of a year. The owner of a call option written on futures F(t,1,2) with exercise time t  1 and measurement period [1, 2] will receive max F(t,1,2) - K, 0 . The most common temperature indices are: Heating Degree Day (HDD),
Cooling Degree Day (CDD), Cumulative Averages (CAT) (or Average Acumulative Temperatures
AAT). The CAT index accounts the accumulated average temperature over [1, 2]:
2
CAT (1, 2) = Tudu,
1
where Tu = (Tu,max +Tu,min)/2 and the measurement period is usually a month or season. The HDD 18index measures the cumulative amount of average temperature below a threshold (typically C or 65F) over a period [1, 2]: max(c-Tu, 0). Similarly, the CDD index accumulate max(Tu -c, 0). At
CME, CAT-CDD futures are traded for European cities, CDD-HDD for US, Canada and Australian
cities and AAT for Japanese cities.

Under the non-arbitrage pricing setting, a CAT temperature future is dened as:

F(t,1,2) = E Q [CAT (1, 2)|Ft] ,
where denotes the market price of risk and the stochastic process for the daily average temperatures after removing seasonality (Xt = Tt - t) is assumed to follow a continuous-time autoregressive process AR(L)(CAR(L)) with deterministic seasonal variation t > 0:

dXt = AXtdt + eLtdBt,

(17)

where Xt  RL for L  1 denotes a vectorial Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, ek a k'th unit vector in RL for k = 1, ...L, Bt a Brownian motion and a L × L-matrix A:

with positive constants k. The AR(L)'s process estimated in (5) can be therefore seen as a discretely sampled continuous-time processes (C AR(L)) (17), see Härdle and López Cabrera (2010) or Benth et al. (2007) for more details. The last three columns of Table 1 display the C AR(3)parameters for all temperature data. Then, for 0  t  1 < 2, the explicit form of an C AT
future price is given by:

with at,1,2 = e1 A-1 [exp {A(2 - t)} - exp {A(1 - t)}], IL a L × L identity matrix (Note that t = t).
The options at CME are cash settled i.e. the owner of a future receives 20 times the Degree Day
tIndex at the end of the measurement period, in return for a xed price. At time , CME trades dierent contracts i = 1, · · · , I with measurement period t  1i < 2i. For example, a contract with i = 7 is six months ahead from the trading day t. For US and Europe CAT/CDD/HDD futures I is usually equal to 7 (April-November or November-April), while for Asia I = 12 (Jan-Dec).

In order to achieve Gaussian risk factors and being able to price temperature future prices, we
 estimate t and t by means of the previous adaptive smoothing techniques. The temperature Iprices given by CME, the index values computed from the realised temperature data (1,2) and the
estimated CAT-AAT future prices with separate adaptive bandwidth for seasonality in mean and
volatility (SeMe Locave, SeMe Locsep, SeMe Locmax) of Berlin, Tokyo and Kaohsiung contracts
are given in Table 7. By inverting (18), we inferred the MPR ( t) from traded weather futures
in Berlin and Tokyo. As we see in Figure 12, the market price of risk for these products is
dierent for dierent cities and contract types and time-varing but constant over contracts. We
use the inferred MPR from Tokyo AAT futures to price over the counter (OTC) ATT futures for
Kaohsiung. Similar to Härdle and López Cabrera (2010), we regress the average MPR of contract
i over the trading period, against the variation in period [1, 2], i.e.

(F^i,t,1,2 - I(1,2))2,

i=1

where F^i,t,1,2 (i = 1, . . . , n the number of contracts) are the estimates of future prices, and I(1,2) is the realised temperature in [1, 2]. Table 8 shows the corresponding RM SE s. The results show smaller RM SE s when future prices are estimated via pricing methods that consider an unbiased
market price of weather risks. By using adaptive local methods, the estimates are closer to the
market temperature prices, meaning that they have learned the market conditional of past weather
surprises. This brings, of course, investment chances: someone who purchased a CAT contract for
Berlin on 20070427 with 1 = 20070501 and 2 = 20070531 would have paid 9 140 EUR (1 index
point = 20 EUR per contract, see Table 7 ). If he had held until expiration, a payo 744 EUR
(9 884-9 140 EUR) would had resulted. The last column of Table 7 shows the dierence between
5 PCME prices (column ) and the estimated risk neutral prices ( = Q or t = 0). Since the risk
neutral prices are quite close to the realised temperature, they can act as a personal forecast for
an investor. When the dierence is positive, the strategy to hedge would be to buy a Call(C),
and a Put(P) for negative dierence. For example, if a farmer in Kaoshiung would like to hedge
the exposure to weather risk, let us say that an accumulated average temperature of 825.89 index points during April 2009, one builds a portfolio of combinations of traded temperature derivatives
e.g. Tokyo's contracts to replicate his payo. In other words, the realised temperature in April
825.89(C) = 1 × 118.32(C) + 1 × 283.18(C) + 0.830395 × 511.07(C), where 118.32, 283.18 and 511.07
denote the CME AAT prices for April, May and June respectively.

5 Conclusions and further work
We show that temperature risk stochastics are closer to Gaussian when applying adaptive statistical methods. We demonstrate that a local smoothing procedure corrects for seasonality and volatility. Technically, the proposed adaptive technique is rooted in ideas of Mercurio and Spokoiny (2004); Spokoiny (2009). We found that the method performs well, not mattering the specication given
for t or t.
tThe localisation works by selection of weights (at each time point ) from a nite number of localising schemes W k, k = 1, . . . , K . We calculate local parametric MLEs ~k that satisfy a small
modeling bias condition. The adaptation of parameters increases the procedures's exibility and estimation accuracy. We also observed in most of the cases, that the proposed method outperforms the standard estimation methods. One obtains fair temperature derivative prices and consequently an unbiased market price of weather risk.
