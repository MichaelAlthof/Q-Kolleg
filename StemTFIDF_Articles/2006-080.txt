Abstract Let W denote a family of probability distributions with parameter space , and WG be a subfamily of W depending on a mapping G :   . Extremum estimations of the parameter vector    are considered. Some sufficient conditions are presented to ensure the uniqueness with probability one. As important applications, the maximum likelihood estimation in curved exponential families and nonlinear regression models with independent disturbances as well as the maximum likelihood estimation of the location and scale parameters of Gumbel distributions are treated.

the parameter space. Some estimation methods currently applied in practical situations of estimation are subsumed under the principle of extremum estimation, for example the maximum likelihood and least squares estimation. Employing the extremum estimation in practice causes the problem to choose some parameter vector if the related maximation (or minimation) problem has more than one solution. Under general conditions the question of the uniqueness of extremum estimation seems to be still open. A known result of some special cases was presented by Pazman (cf. [8]). He showed that in some curved exponential families the maximum likelihood method has at most one solution with probability one. The present paper is an attempt to generalize the result of Pazman to a greater variety of applications, with respect to the extremum estimation. Since there is no essential difference between maximation and minimization, we shall restrict ourselves to estimation that maximizes a certain function which is dependent on the parameters. After introducing some general notations we shall present in section 3 our main result. We shall deal with the estimation of parameter vectors of distributions which are dominated by Lebesgue measures. The fundamental idea is to employ Sard's theorem to ensure that almost surely the estimation has at most one solution, adapting the line of reasoning that Pazman followed in the above mentioned paper. It may be simplified when considering uniqueness of nonlinear least squares estimation. So the reader is referred to Pazman's monograph on nonlinear regression (cf. [9]) to get a first idea. The main result of the paper relies on the assumption that for almost every observation from the sample space the respective objective function has only non degenerated critical points. In section 4 this assumption will be replaced by some conditions to restate the main result. The obtained criteria to ensure uniqueness of extremum estimation almost surely will be applied to the maximum likelihood estimation in nonlinear regression models with independent disturbances (section 5) as well as curved exponential families (section 6), and also to maximum likelihood estimation of the location and scale parameter of a Gumbel distribution (section 7). Appendix A provides a crucial auxiliary result, whereas appendix B deals with the proof of the main theorem. Finally appendix C reviews Lindel¨of's theorem and useful special versions of Sard's theorem.

2 Notations and preliminaries
For a differentiable mapping f : H  Rt defined on an open subset H of Rs, the Jacobian of f at x will be denoted by Jx(f ), its rank will be symbolized by rank(Jx(f )). As usual f will be called a Cr-mapping (r  N) if it is r times continuously differentiable. f is said to be a Cr-immersion/Cr-submersion (r  N) if it is a Cr-mapping with rank(Jx(f )) = s/rank(Jx(f )) = t for all x  H. If t = n, and if f is an homeomorphism from H onto the open subset f (H) such that f : H  f (H) and its inverse f -1 : f (H)  H are Cr-immersions, then f is called a Cr-diffeomorphism onto f (H). The Jacobians of a Cr-diffeomorphism are nonsingular. In the case of t = 1 xf stands for the gradient of f at x, whereas xf will be used for the Hessian of f at x if f is twice differentiable. If xf = 0, then we shall speak of x as a critical point, which will be called degenerated provided that xf is singular. For m  N0 and r  N a subset A  Rs is called a m-dimensional Cr-submanifold of Rs if for any x  A there exists a Cr-diffeomorphism f from an open neighbourhood U of x in Rs onto the open subset f (U ) of Rs such that f (U  A) = f (U )  {(x1, ..., xs)  Rs | xm+1 = ... = xs = 0} (cf. [1], Definition 2.1.1). Note that in view of Lindel¨of's theorem (cf. appendix C, Proposition C.2) a 0-dimensional Cr-submanifold of Rs is an at most countable set. If g : U  Rt denotes a Cr-submersion from an open subset U of Rs into Rt, then we know by the regular value theorem (cf. [4], p.14 or p.22, Theorem 3.2) that for each y  Rt the fibre g-1({y}) is empty or a (s - t)-dimensional Cr-submanifold of Rs. The transpose of a vector x in a standard euclidean space or a matrix M will be indicated by x and M respectively. Furthermore the notation t will be employed for the Lebesgue measure on Rt. Throughout the paper we shall consider the following setting of extremum estimation: Let Y be a random vector with measurable space (X , B(X )), where X is an open subset of Rn, and B(X ) denotes the -algebra of Borel subsets of X . We suppose that the distribution QY of Y may be parameterized by a mapping G :   Rm, i.e. it belongs to a familiy WG = {PG() |   } of probability distributions, which in addition we assume to be dominated by n | Borel(X ). Of course the parameter  should be identified, which implies
3

(2.1) G is injective.
Starting from a realisation y of the random vector Y, we are interested in estimating the (unknown) vector  by maximizing the mapping l(y; ·)  G =: lG(y; ·) defined by a given mapping l(·; ·) : X ×   R, where  stands for an open subset of Rm enclosing G(). Additionally, it will be assumed

(2.2) G() = Gj(j), where Gj denotes a C2-mapping defined on an open subset j of Rrj ,
j=1
(2.3) l(·; ·) is a C2-mapping.

3 Statement of the main result

The main result relies on the following additional assumptions.
(3.1) Under (2.2), (2.3) the set Lj, consisting of all y  X such that l(y, ·)  Gj has degenerated critical points, is a n-null set for each j  N.
(3.2) Under (2.2), (2.3) every set Lij (i, j  N) of all y  X with il(y, ·)  Gi = 0, j l(y, ·)  Gj = 0 and yl(·, Gi(i)) = yl(·, Gj(j)) for some (i, j)  i × j, Gi(i) = Gj(j), is a n-null set.
Later on we shall replace (3.1) by some sufficient conditions.

Theorem 3.1 Let the assumptions (2.1) - (2.3) be fulfilled. If the mappings Gj (j  N) are C2- immersions, and if the conditions (3.1), (3.2) are valid, then

B(X )

with QY (K) = 0.

The proof is delegated to appendix B. In the following we try to substitute condition (3.1). Our main tool will be provided by Lemma A.1 (cf. appendix A). Unfortunately, it can be applied directly only in the case that the dimension n of the sample

4

space X coincides with the dimension m of the parameter space . But if we are in the position to modify the maximization problem in a suitable way we would be able to draw on Lemma A.1. We shall treat the cases n  m and m  n separately.

4 Specializations

In the case of n  m we can use Lemma A.1 if we may reduce the dimension of the sample space by the following condition:
(4.1) There exist a C2-submersion T : X  Rm and a real-valued C2-mapping l on T (X ) ×  such that l(y; ·) = l(T (y); ·) holds for arbitrary y  X .
Since T is a C1-submersion, T (X ) is an open subset of Rm, and moreover, n(T -1(B)) = 0 if m(B) = 0 (cf. [8], Proposition A3). Then a direct application of Theorem 3.1 with Lemma A.1 leads to the following result concerning the uniqueness of the extremum estimation of .

Theorem 4.1 Let the condition (4.1) as well as the assumptions (2.1) - (2.3) be valid, let the mappings Gj (j  N) be C2-immersions, and let condition (3.2) be fulfilled. If there exist some C1-diffeomorphism g from an open subset U of Rm onto an open subset g(U ) of Rm and a C1-mapping  :   Rm such that t - ()  U and l(t; ·) = g(t - ()) hold for (t, )  T (X ) × , then

with QY (K) = 0.

Remark 4.2 If n = m, condition (4.1) is satisfied, choosing for T the restriction of the identity mapping on Rn to X . Therefore we may restate in this case Theorem 4.1 without condition (4.1).

Now let m  n. For reduction of the dimension of  we want to assume:

(4.2) Under (2.2), (2.3) there exist an open subset H of X × Rn with nonvoid Hy := {x  Rn | (y, x)  H} (y  X ), a C2-mapping l : H  R and a sequence (F j)j of mappings F j : Aj  Rn such that the following properties are satisfied

5

a) F j is a C2-immersion on an open subset of Rpj for every j  N. b) If for y  X and arbitrary j  N the mapping l(y, ·)  Gj has a degenerated critical point, then
the mapping l(y, ·)  F j|(F j)-1(Hy) has a degenerated critical point too.
Under condition (4.2) the combination of Theorem 3.1 and Lemma A.1 (cf. appendix A) reads as follows.
Theorem 4.3 Let the condition (4.2) as well as the assumptions (2.1) - (2.3) be valid, let the mappings Gj (j  N) be C2-immersions, and let condition (3.2) be fulfilled. If there exist some C1-diffeomorphism g from an open subset U of Rn onto an open subset g(U ) of Rn, an open subset V of Rn with V  Hy,
yX
and a C1-mapping  : V  Rn such that y - ()  U and l(y; ·) = g(y - ()) hold for (y, )  H, then
K := {y  X | lG(y; ) = lG(y; ~) = max lG(y; ) for some different , ~  }  B(X )

with QY (K) = 0.
Proof: Due to Lindelo¨f's theorem (cf. appendix C, Proposition C.2) we may find a sequence (Ul × Vl)l of

open subsets of Rn × Rn with Ul × Vl = H. In view of Lemma A.1 (cf. appendix A) the set Blj of all
l=1
y  Ul with l(y, ·)  F j|(F j)-1(Vl) having a degenerated critical point is a n-null set for l, j  N. Then, condition (4.2) implies condition (3.1), and the statement of Theorem 4.1 follows from Theorem 3.1.
5 Maximum likelihood estimation in nonlinear regression
models
Let Y = F () + U be a nonlinear regression model with nonstochastic regressors, where
(6.1) Y denotes the random vector of the endogenous variables,
(6.2) F : A  Rn stands for the regression function defined on a subset A of Rr, r  n,
6

(6.3) U =: (U1, ..., Un) symbolizes the random vector of the disturbances Ui which are supposed to be independently and normally distributed with

EU = 0, (V ar(U1), ..., V ar(Un)) =: F~(), F~ : (]0, [)q  Rn,   (i1, ..., in)

(i1, ..., in fixed values with {i1, ..., in} = {1, ..., q}).

It is easy to see that the parameter vector (, ) is identified if and only if

(6.4) the injectivity of the regression function F is supposed.

Moreover, we assume that

(6.5) a sequence (pj)j of positive integers pj  n, a sequence (Aj)j of open subsets Aj of Rpj and a

sequence (F j)j of mappings F j : Aj  Rn exist with



F (A) =

F j(Aj).

j=1

W denotes the family of normal distributions with independent marginal distributions.  := Rn ×(]0, [)n is a parameter space of W. We can now apply our results of extremum estimation to the maximum likelihood estimation of (, ).

Theorem 5.1 Let us retake assumptions (6.1)-(6.5), let l(y, ·) denote the log likelihood function w.r.t. W and the realization y of Y. Furthermore let G : A × (]0, [)q   be defined by G(, ) := (F (), F~()). If the mappings F j are C2-immersions, then
K := {y  Rn | lG(y; ) = lG(y; ~) = max lG(y; ) for some different , ~  } is a Borel subset of Rn

with QY (K) = 0.
Proof: Let for a positive integer j the mapping Gj : Aj × (]0, [)q   be defined by Gj(j, ) = (F j(j), F~()). Then by assumption G fulfills the conditions (2.1), (2.2).

Next let us introduce the open subset H := {(y, µ)  Rn × Rn | (yt - µt)2 = 0 for all i  {1, ..., q}}
tTi
of Rn × Rn, where Ti := {t  {1, ..., n} | F~t() = i} for i  {1, ..., q}. Furthermore let us consider the

mappings h : H  (]0, [)q, defined by h(y, µ) = (

1 T1

[yt

-

µt]2,

...,

1 Tq

[yt

and

the

mapping

l : H  R, defined by

l(y, µ) := l(y, µ, F~  h(y, µ)) = - 1 n(ln(2) + 1) + q 2

Ti[ln(

(yt - µt)2) - ln( Ti)] .

i=1 tTi

By routine procedures it can be shown that l and (F j)j satisfy condition (4.2). Note that we have

l(y; µ, ·)  F~ = 0   = (

1 T1

[yt
tT1

-

µt]2,

...,

1 Tq

[yt
tTq

-

µt]2),

for all (y, µ)  H.

Moreover we can define on U := {x  Rn | x2t = 0 for all i  {1, ..., q}} the mapping g : U  Rn by

tTi

i=1

We

for

(y,

H

y - µ  U, µl(y; ·) = g(y - µ), yl(·; µ) = -g(y - µ),

g is a bijective indefinitely differentiable function from U onto U with g-1 = g. Thus yl(·; µ) = yl(·; µ~) for arbitrary µ = µ~, which means that condition (3.2) is fulfilled. The statement of the theorem follows from Theorem 4.3.

6 Maximum likelihood estimation in curved exponential
families
Let  be a -finite measure on the -algebra B(Rn) of Borel subsets of Rn which is dominated by the Lebesgue measure on Rn. Additionally, let N := {  Rn | 0 < Rn exp( y)(dy) < } and  be an open subset of Rn enclosed in N . Introducing  : N  [-, ],   ln( Rn exp( y)(dy)) we consider a minimal exponential family W := {P |   } of probability distributions having densities
f : Rn  R, y  exp( y - ()) (  )
8

with respect to . The parameter vector  is identified since W is a minimal exponential family with parameter space   N (cf. [2],Theorem 1.13). G :    denotes an injective mapping which induces the subfamily WG := {PG()  W |   } of W. Now we may consult Theorem 4.1 concerning the uniqueness of the maximum likelihood estimation of the parameter vector .
Theorem 6.1 Let the mapping G satify the conditions (2.1), (2.2), let Y be a random vector with distribution QY  WG, and let l(y; ·) :   R denote the log likelihood function with respect to W and y  Rn. If the mappings Gj (j  N) are C2-immersions, then
K := {y  Rn | lG(y; ) = lG(y; ~) = max lG(y; ) for some different , ~  } is a Borel subset of Rn

with QY (K) = 0.
Proof: | is indefinitely differentiable (cf. [11], Satz 1.164), which implies that  :   Rn,   , and l(·; ·) | X ×  : X × int()  R, defined by l(y; ) =  y - (), are indefinitely differentiable. Moreover, for arbitrary y  X and different , ~   we may observe yl(·; ) =  = ~ = yl(·; ~), and furthermore l(y; ·) = y - . Thus the statement is a direct consequence of Theorem 4.1. Remark: Theorem 6.1 retains the result of Pazman (cf. [8], Theorem) mentioned in the introduction, which in turn also encompasses Pazman's criterion concerning the uniqueness of nonlinear least squares estimation in nonlinear regression models with nonstochastic regressors and i.i.d. disturbances (cf. [7], Theorem 3 and [9], Corollary 4.4.6).

(cf. [5], p. 76). We want to investigate the uniqueness of the maximum likelihood estimation of (µ, )

based on a random sample Y := (Y1, ..., Yn) (n  2) from a Gumbel distribution.

For this purposes let us introduce the mapping

n
l(·; ·) : Rn × (R×]0, [)  R, ((y1, ..., yn); (1, 2))  n ln(2) + ln f(0,1)(2yi - 1)
i=1

Since

is

bijective,

we

may

check

easily

that

for

every

realization

(y1, .., yn) of (Y1, ..., Y1) the maximum likelihood estimation of (µ, ) has at most one solution if and only if

the mapping l((y1, ..., yn); ·) has at most one maximizing point. Therefore we might try to apply Theorem

3.1 to l(·; ·) and the identity mapping G on R×]0, [. Obviously, both mappings together satisfy the

assumptions (2.1) - (2.3), and G is a C2-immersion.

Observing

Now let (^1, ^2) be a critical point of the function l((y1, ..., yn; ·)  G. Then exp(^1) = n n

Thus the set L of all (y1, ..., yn)  Rn with l((y1, ..., yn); ·)  G having a degenerated critical point coincides
n
with the subvector space of all (y1, ..., yn)  Rn with nyi = yj for i = 1, ..., n. In particular L is a
j=1
n-null set.

Let us now consider for (y1, ..., yn)  Rn different critical points (^1, ^2) and (~1, ^2) of l((y1, ..., y1); ·) 

G satisfying (y1,...,yn)l(·; (^1, ^2)) = (y1,...,yn)l(·; (~1, ~2)). This means that for each i  {1, ..., n} the equation ^2(exp(^1) exp(-^2yi) - 1) = ~2(exp(~1) exp(-~2yi) - 1) is valid. Hence ^2 = ~2, say ^2 > ~2,

and additionally ^2 exp(^1) = (^2 - ~2) exp(^2yi) + ~2 exp(~1) exp((^2 - ~2)yi) for i = 1, ..., n, which in turn

implies (^2 - ~2) exp(^2yi) + ~2 exp(~1) exp((^2 - ~2)yi) = (^2 - ~2) exp(^2y1) + ~2 exp(~1) exp((^2 - ~2)y1)

for i = 1, ..., n.

The mapping g : R  R, x  (^2 - ~2) exp(^2x) + ~2 exp(~1) exp((^2 - ~2)x), is differentiable, and its

derivatives satisfy

Therefore g is injective, and we may conclude y1 = ... = yn. Then we know that the set L^ of all (y1, ..., yn) such that (y1,...,yn)l(·; (^1, ^2)) = (y1,...,yn)l(·; (~1, ~2)) holds for some couple (^1, ^2) and (~1, ^2) of different critical points of l((y1, ..., y1); ·)  G is enclosed in the subvector space of all (y1, ..., yn)  Rn with y1 = ... = yn. In particular L^ is a n-null set. Altogether we have shown that l(·; ·) and G fulfill the conditions (3.1), (3.2), and this yields the following

result concerning the uniqueness of the maximum likelihood estimation of (µ, ) due to Theorem 3.1.

Theorem 7.1 Let Y := (Y1, ..., Yn) (n  2) be a random sample from the Gumbel distribution with the location parameter µ  R and scale parameter  > 0, and let L(y1, ..., yn; ·) denote the likelihood function

11

w.r.t. the family of Gumbel distributions and the realization (y1, ..., yn). Furthermore let the distribution of Y be symbolized by QY . Then
K := {(y1, ..., yn)  Rn | L((y1, ..., yn); ·) has at least two maximizing points} is a Borel subset of Rn with QY (K) = 0.
A Appendix
Lemma A.1 Let H1, H2 be open subsets of Rk, and let f : H1 × H2  R be a C2-mapping. Moreover there exist some C1-diffeomorphism g from an open subset U of Rk onto an open subset g(U ) of Rk and a C1-mapping  : H2  Rk such that t - ()  U and f (t; ·) = g(t - ()) hold for (t, )  H1 × H2. If F denotes a C2-immersion from an open subset A of Rp into H2, then k(BF ) = 0, where BF is defined to consist of all t  H1 such that f (t, ·)  F = 0 and det f (t, ·)  F = 0 for some   H2.
Proof: For p = k we have
f (t; ·)  F = 0, det f (t; ·)  F = 0  F ()f (t; ·) = 0, det F ()f (t; ·) = 0.
Thus, defining, ~ : U~  Rk, t  (t) + g-1(0), we may conclude BF  ~({t  U~ | det Jt(~) = 0}). Note that g is a diffeomorphism with
F ()f (t; ·) = g(t -   F ()). Sard's theorem (cf. appendix C, Proposition C.1) leads to k(BF ) = 0. Now let p < k. Since F is a C2-immersion, we may conclude from the rank theorem together with standard orthonormalization that for an arbitrary   A there are C1- mappings h1, ..., hk-p defined on an open neigbourhood U of  in A satisfying
hi(~) J~(F ) = 0, hi (~) hi (~) = 1, hi(~) hq j (~) = 0 (i = q)
12

for every ~  U and arbitrary i, q  {1, ..., k - p}. By Lindelo¨f's theorem (cf. appendix C, Proposition C.2) we may select a sequence ((s))s in A such that (U(s))s is a cover of A. For abbreviation we set Us := U(s), his := hi(s) (i = 1, ..., k - p). Furthermore x : Rk  R denotes the projection on the -th component (  {1, ..., k}). We observe for (t, )  H1 × A
f (t; ·)  F = J(F ) F ()f (t; ·)

Let for s  N the mappings gs, s : Ws  Rk be defined by gs(, b) := bihsi () and s(, b) :=
i=1
k-p
  F () + g-1  gs(, b), where Ws consists of all (, b)  Us × Rk-p with bihis()  g(U ). Notice that
i=1
Ws is an open subset of Rk, and that gs is a C1-mapping, which implies that s is a C1-mapping.

Now let (t^, ^)  H1 × A with ^f (t^; ·)  F = 0. Then there exist some s  N and a vector ^b := (^b1, ..., ^bk-p)

from Rk-p with

k-p
g(t^-   F (^)) = F (^)f (t^; ·) = ^bihsi (^).

In particular (^, ^b)  WS, and g(t^-   F (^)) = gs(^, ^b). Hence t^ = s(^, ^b).

As a consequence of J(F ) his() = 0 for   Us as well as i = 1, ..., k - p we obtain

and therefore

^f (t^; ·)  F = -J^(F ) Jt^-F (^)(g)J^(s(·; ^b)).

Following the rules for determinants of partioned matrices ( cf. [3], p.43, equation (II)), we get
| det[J^(F ), hs1(^), ..., hks-p(^)] Jt^-F (^)(g)J(^,^b)(s)| = | det J^(F ) Jt^-F (^)(g)J^(s(·; ^b))| = | det ^f (t^; ·)  F |
[J^(F ), h1s(^), ..., hsk-p(^)] Jt^-F (^)(g) has rank k since F is an immersion. Therefore we can conclude
det ^j f (t^; ·)  F j = 0  det J(^,^b)(s) = 0

Thus BF  N := s({(, b)  Ws | det J(,b)(s) = 0}). Applying Sard's theorem (cf. appendix C,
s=1
Proposition C.1), we get N as a set of Lebesgue-measure zero, which completes the proof.

B Appendix

Proof of Theorem 3.1:

Let us retake notations and assumptions from Theorem 3.1. Furthermore let us introduce for positive

integer i, j the set Mij consisting of all y  X with il(y, ·)  Gi = 0, j l(y, ·)  Gj = 0 and l(y, Gi(i)) =

l(y, Gj(j)) for some i, j with Gi(i) = Gj(j). Obviously, K 

Mij. Therefore it remains to

(i,j)N×N

show

(1) Mij is a n-null set for arbitrary i, j  N. (2) K is a Borel subset of X .

proof of (1): Let us define for i, j  N the open subset U := (i, j, y)  i ×j ×X | Gi(i) = Gj(j) of i ×j ×X , and the set Z := h-1({0})  i × j × (Rn \ (Li  Lj  Lij)), where
h : U  Rri+rj+1, (i, j, y)  il(y; ·)  Gi, j l(y; ·)  Gj, l(y; Gi(i)) - l(y; Gj(j)) .

14

Let

(^i, ^j, y)

be

an

element

of

Z

and

s



{1, ..., n}

with

l(·;Gi(^i ys

))

(y)

=



l(·;Gj (^j ys

))

(y

).

Using

the

Laplace-

expansion of determinants and the rules of partioned matrices (cf. [3], p.43, equation (I)), we obtain

det[J(^i ,^j ) (h(·,

·,

y)),

h ys

(^i,

^j ,

y)]

= det(^il(y; ·)  Gi) det(^j l(y; ·)  Gj)

l(·;

Gi(^i)) (y)

-

l(·;

Gj (^j )) (y)

ys ys

= 0,

noticing y  Li  Lj. Thus Z is a subset of U~ := {(i, j, y)  U | rank of J(i,j,y)(h) = ri + rj + 1}, which is an open subset of Rri+rj+n. Therefore h | U~ is a C1-submersion and Z~ := (h | U~ )-1({0}) is empty or

a (n - 1)-dim. C1-submanifold of Rri+rj+n. We have

Mij \ (Li  Lj  Lij) = P r(Z)  P r(Z~),

where P r denotes the canonical projection from Rri+rj+n onto Rn. By Sard's theorem (cf. appendix C, Proposition C.1) we get n(P r(Z~)) = 0 and, due to assumptions (3.1), (3.2),

n(Mij) = n Mij \ (Li  Lj  Lij) + n Li  Lj  Lij = 0.

proof of (2):
For positive integers i,j we define the open subset Nij := {(i, j)  i × j | Gi(i) = Gj(j)} of i × j
respectively Rri+rj . Applying Lindel¨of's Theorem (cf. appendix C, Proposition C.2) and using the local

compactness of Nij we get a sequence (U × V) of compact sets U × V satisfying Nij = U × V.
=1
Since each set U × V is sequentially compact, every y  X being an accumulation point of the set

Gij :=

y  X | l(y; Gi(i)) = l(y; Gj(j)) = max lG(y; ) for some (i, j)  U × V


is also an element of Gij, i.e. the sets Gij are closed in X and therefore Borel subsets. Then K is a Borel

subset because

 

K=

Gij

i=1 j=1 =1

Therefore (2) is shown, which completes the proof.

C Appendix
Proposition C.1 (Special versions of Sard's theorem) Let f : U  Rt denote a Cr-mapping (r  N) from an open subset U of Rs into Rt. Then we can state:
.1 If s = t, then f ({x  U | det Jx(f ) = 0}) is a t-null set. .2 If A  U is a m-dimensional Cr-submanifold of Rs with 0  m < t, then f (A) is a t-null set.
These versions of Sard's theorem may be found in [1] (Corollary 3.3.17.4 and Theorem 4.3.1) or in [4] (p. 69) or in [10] (remark on Definition 3.3 and Theorem 3.1).
Proposition C.2 (Lindel¨of 's theorem) Let (,  ) denote a topological Hausdorff space such that  has a countable base. Then every open cover of a subset A   has a countable subcover.
For a proof cf. e.g. [6] (p.49).
