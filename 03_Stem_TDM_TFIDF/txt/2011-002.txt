Longitudinal data analysis is a central piece of statistics. The data are curves and they are observed at random locations. This makes the construction of a simultaneous confidence corridor (SCC) (confidence band) for the mean function a challenging task on both the theoretical and the practical side. Here we propose a method based on local linear smoothing that is implemented in the sparse (i.e., low number of nonzero coefficients) modelling situation. An SCC is constructed based on recent results obtained in applied probability theory. The precision and performance is demonstrated in a spectrum of simulations and applied to growth curve data. Technically speaking, our paper intensively uses recent insights into extreme value theory that are also employed to construct a shoal of confidence intervals (SCI).
1. Introduction. Longitudinal or functional data analysis (FDA) is a central piece of statistical modelling. A well known application is growth curve analysis in biology, medicine and chemistry, see e.g. Mu®ller (2009), James, Hastie and Sugar (2000), Ferraty and Vieu (2006) and the references there. Groundbreaking theoretical work on functional data analysis has been done among others by

Much of this work though is devoted to coefficient estimation, semiparametric analysis or dimension reduction methods. Research on statistical inference on the mean curve for example is rather scarce although it is potentially important for characterization of global properties. To characterize global properties of the unknown function of interest, the simultaneous confidence corridor (SCC) and the shoal of confidence intervals (SCI) are puissant instruments. They can be applied to test the overall trend or shape of the mean function. Such decisions are critical e.g. in ozone analysis, see Lucas and Diggle (1997) for a longitudinal study on Sitka spruce. They have pointed out that, in order to assess the cumulative effect of ozone pollution on spruce, an inference on the mean function of spruce growth during the entire experiment rather than at the end of the growth is required. This is one of the many other motivations to develop a new method and its theory to construct an SCC for the mean function of sparse longitudinal data where the measurements are randomly located with random repetitions.
The SCC methodology has been extensively studied in the literature. For the nonparametric regression, see Fan and Zhang (2000) and references there. In this strand of literature though it is not assumed that for family of curves one needs to take care of dependence structures. Wu and Zhao (2007) recently constructed a confidence band for the non-stationary mean function, and Wang and Yang (2009), Song and Yang (2009) obtained the spline-based analogy for the mean and variance functions. Nonparametric time series with specific dependence structures are considered in Zhao and Wu (2008). An SCC construction for longitudinal data remains however an open problem.
The major difficulty to construct the SCC for longitudinal data is that the observations within subject are dependent. In this situation, the "Hungarian embedding", used to construct confidence bands is no longer applicable. The sparse longitudinal data situation has been considered by Yao et al. (2005a) for individual trajectories instead of the mean function, while Yao (2007) obtained an SCI for the mean and covariance functions. Ma et al. (2010) constructed the first SCC of the mean function for the sparse longitudinal data through piecewise constant spline. The constructed SCC, however, is nonsmooth and

its convergence rate to the true mean function has suboptimal rate. Here we propose to construct the SCC for the mean function of the sparse longitudinal data via local
linear smoothing. We tackle with this research a variety of interesting issues. First, the proposed SCC allows for the global rather than pointwise inference. Second, the sparse rather than dense longitudinal data setting requires more sophisticated extreme value theory. Third, compared to the piecewise constant spline method of Ma et al. (2010), different extreme value results are employed for a local linear estimator that leads to higher accuracy, better coverage, smooth mean curve and smooth SCC, all of which are desirable in the application.
We organize our paper as follows. In Section 2, we state our model and local linear smoothing methodology. In Section 3, we investigate the asymptotic distribution of the maximal deviation of the local linear estimator from the true mean function, which is used to construct the SCC. Section 4 outlines the key procedures to implement the SCC. Section 5 illustrates the performance of the SCC through extensive simulations followed by an empirical example in Section 6 which illustrates the SCC application on growth curve data. Technical proofs are presented in the Appendix.

2. Model and Methodology. Longitudinal data has the form of {Xij, Yij} , 1  j  Ni, 1  i 

n, in which Xij  X = [a, b] is the j-th random time point for the i-th subject and Yij is the response

measured at Xij. For the i-th subject, the sample path is the noisy realization of a continuous time

stochastic process i (x), namely,

Yij = i (Xij ) +  (Xij ) ij ,

(2.1)

where the errors ij are i.i.d. with E ij = 0, E i2j = 1, and {i (x) , x  X } are i.i.d. copies of the process 
{ (x) , x  X } with E X 2 (x) dx < +.
Denote by m (x) = E  (x) the regression curve and by G (x, x) = Cov { (x) ,  (x)} the covariance

operator with the Karhunen-Lo`eve L2 representation

 i (x) = m (x) + k=1 ikk (x) ,

(2.2)

4 S. ZHENG, L. YANG AND W. K. HA® RDLE

one has the random coefficients {ik}k=1 uncorrelated with mean 0 and variance 1. Here k (x) =

 kk (x) ,

where

{k }k=1

and

{k (x)}k=1

are

respectively

the

eigenvalues

and

eigenfunctions

of

G (x, x) such that 1  2  . . .  0 and {k}k=1 forms an orthonormal basis of L2 (X ). There-

(x).

In applications, the number of eigenfunctions k (x) , k = 1, 2, ... needs to be chosen by some criterion,

see Yao et al. (2005a). In the sparse curve data situation, many practical studies have shown that fitting

too many eigenfunctions can heavily degrade the overall fit, see e.g. James, Hastie and Sugar (2000).

Hence, in what follows, we assume that k = 0 if k > , where  is a positive constant. Equations (2.1)

and (2.2) can then be written as:

 Yij = m (Xij ) + k=1 ikk (Xij ) +  (Xij ) ij .

(2.3)

For convenience, we denote the conditional variance of Yij given Xij = x as

Y2 (x) = G (x, x) + 2 (x) = Var (Yij |Xij = x ) .

(2.4)

We are interested in the sparse situation where the number of measurements Ni within subject are

i.i.d. copies of a positive random integer N1, see Yao et al. (2005a), Yao et al. (2005b), Yao (2007).

To introduce the estimator, denote by K a kernel function, h = hn > 0 a bandwidth and Kh (x) =

h-1K

(x/h).

Let

NT

=

n
i=1

Ni

be the total sample size and define Y = (Yij)1jNi,1in the NT ◊ 1

vector of responses. For any x  [0, 1], let X = X (x) = (1, Xij - x)1jNi,1in be the design matrix for linear regression and W = W (x) = NT-1 diag {Kh (X11 - x) , ∑ ∑ ∑ , Kh (XnNn - x)} the kernel weight

diagonal matrix. Following Fan and Gijbels (1996), local linear estimators of m (x) and m (x) are

{m (x) , m (x)}T = arg min{Y - X(a, b)T}TW{Y - X(a, b)T}
a,b
= (XTWX)-1 XTWY.

Consequently, with e0T = (1, 0), m (x) is written as m (x) = e0T (XTWX)-1 XTWY,

3. Main Results. Without loss of generality, assume X = [0, 1] and consider the assumptions:

(A1) The mean function m (x)  C2[0, 1], i.e. twice continuously differentiable. (A2) {Xij}i=,1,j=1 are i.i.d. with a probability density f (x). The functions f (x) ,  (x) and k  C1[0, 1]
with f (x)  [cf , Cf ] ,  (x)  [c, C] and all involved constants are finite and positive. (A3) The numbers of observations Ni, i = 1, 2, . . . are i.i.d. random positive integers with E N1r 
r!cNr , r = 2, 3, . . . for some constant cN > 0. (Ni)i=1 , (Xij )i=,1,j=1 , (ik)i=,1,k=1 , (ij )i=,1,j=1 are independent, while {ik}i=,1,k=1 are i.i.d. N (0, 1). (A4) There exists r > 5, such that E |11|r < . (A5) The bandwidth h = hn satisfies nh4  , nh5 log n  0 and h < 1/2.
(A6) The kernel function K (x) is a symmetric probability density function supported on [-1, 1] and  C3[-1, 1].

Assumptions (A1), (A2), (A5) and (A6) haven been postulated in many papers related to kernel

smoothing. (A3) has been used in Yao et al. (2005a). (A4) can be found also in Ma et al. (2010).

Kx (u) = K (u) {µ2,x (K) - µ1,x (K) u} Dx-1 (K) , Kx,h (u) = Kx (u/h) /h where Dx-1 (K) exists by Lemma A.5. One may verify:

with n2 (x) and Qh() given in (3.4) and (3.5).

By Theorem 3.1, we construct the SCC and SCI for m(x) as follows,

COROLLARY 3.1. Assume (A1)-(A6). A 100 (1 - ) % simultaneous confidence corridor (SCC)

for m (x) is:

[m (x) ± n (x) Qh()] .

(3.8)

PROPOSITION 3.1. Given (A2), (A3) and (A6), then supx[0,1] n-1 (x) n,IID (x) - 1 = O (h) .

Using n2,IID (x) instead of n2 (x) is equivalent to treat {Xij, Yij} , 1  j  Ni, 1  i  n as i.i.d data, which implies that the longitudinal dependence structure is negligible in case of sparsity. This was also observed by Ma et al. (2010), Wang et al. (2005).

4. Implementation. Now we outline the construction of the SCC and SCI. Recall the definition

of m (x). The practical implementation of (3.6) and (3.7) is via estimating E N1, f (x) and Y (x),

see Wang and Yang (2009) and references therein. The quantity E N1 is estimated by NT/n and the

estimator of the density f (x) is

where ij = Yij - m (Xij), wij = NT-1Kh (Xij - x) and h = NT-1/5 (log n)-1 satisfying (A5). The

consistency of f (x) and Y (x) is proved e.g. in Li and Hsing (2010), Yao et al. (2005a). Therefore, the

SCC m (x) ± ^n,IID (x) Qh() and the SCI m (x) ± ^n,IID (x) z1-/2 both have asymptotic confidence

level 1 - .

5. Monte Carlo Studies. This section checks the finite sample performance of the SCC. The data are generated from (2.1) with  = 2:
2 Yij = m (Xij ) + k=1 ikk (Xij ) +  (Xij ) ij , with m (x) = sin {2 (x - 1/2)}, 1 (x) = -0.2 cos { (x - 1/2)}, 2 (x) = 0.1 sin { (x - 1/2)},  (x) = exp{3(x - 0.5)2}/[1 + exp{3(x - 0.5)2}] and X  U [0, 1] , k  N (0, 1) , ij  N (0, 1), while Ni has a

8 S. ZHENG, L. YANG AND W. K. HA® RDLE

discrete uniform distribution from 5, . . . , 15 and n varies: 20,50,100,200. The confidence level is set to: 1 -  = 0.95, 0.99.
(Insert Figure 1 "Dataplot and trajectories" about here)

The empirical coverage is reported in Table 1. The data are displayed in Figure 1. Clearly, the coverage approaches the nominal confidence levels as n increases, see Theorem 3.1. Coverage frequencies remain stable if the bandwidths' slightly vary. In practice, one can choose bandwidths adaptively to achieve better performance. The theoretical study of this issue would require too much space here. We therefore do not pursue this. Figure 2 plots the SCCs with 95% and 99% confidence levels. The above studies have illustrated the reliability of our method, which actually ensures the application of the SCC including the true curve for the real data in Section 6.
(Insert Figure 2 "The 95% and 99% SCCs of the mean curve" about here)

6. Application. Now we apply the SCC and SCI to a longitudinal study of growth curve data. The data curve analysis is a key in the studies of human skeletal health. These data consist of measurements Yij, spinal bone mineral density (g/cm2), for n = 286 people. However, Ni, the number of measurements for each individual, is between 2 and 4 (sparsity), and Xij, the time points of measurements (aged 8.8≠ 26.2 yr), varies among individuals.
An earlier study of the growth curve data in James, Hastie and Sugar (2000) developed the pointwise inference of the mean function. Using the bootstrap method, they constructed the confidence intervals to test the mean curve at points of interest, e.g. the fastest growth point at about 15 yr. In our study, this task can be also done via constructing the SCI by (3.7). However, its computation is much faster than the bootstrap procedures. Furthermore, we will use the SCC to examine the global shape of the mean

A CONFIDENCE CORRIDOR FOR SPARSE LONGITUDINAL DATA CURVES

9

curve on the whole domain, such as the upward or downward trend at different stages, the acceleration or plateau during different periods.
(Insert Figure 3 "Growth curve data and the SCCs & SCIs of its mean curve" about here) Figure 3 (a) exhibits the scatter plot of the spinal bone density v.s. the age. Figure 3 (b), (c) and (d) depict the SCCs and SCIs of the population mean of the growth curve data, at the confidence levels of 90%, 95% and 99%, respectively. For the pointwise inference, James, Hastie and Sugar (2000) and our method share similar SCIs. However, testing the global shape of the growth curve, the constructed SCCs can indicate that the spinal bone density at mean level increases with age, but the bone growth is accelerated during early adolescence (9-15 yr) whereas it reaches the plateau during late puberty (16-26 yr). An R algorithm of our method has been provided on www.quantlet.org.

U{bn (x)} and an (x) = U {bn (x)} respectively means that, as n  , supx[0,1] |an (x) /bn (x)| = O(1)

and supx[0,1] |an (x) /bn (x)| = O (1). In addition, an (x) = Ua.s. {bn (x)} and an (x) = Ua.s. {bn (x)}

respectively means that, as n  , an (x) = U{bn (x)} and an (x) = U {bn (x)} almost surely, and Oa.s.,

Op, Oa.s., Op are similarly defined.

(A.14)

 Applying Lemma A.4 for NT, one has |(n E N1) /NT - 1| = Oa.s{ log n/n} and (A.14) also implies



()



that sup I1(x) = Oa.s.( log n/n). Now, by (A.12), sn,0 (x) = f (x) + U h2 + Ua.s.{ log n/(nh)}.

x[h,1-h]





Similarly, sn,1 (x) = U (h) + Ua.s.{ log n/(nh) }and sn,2(x) = f (x)µ2(K) + U (h) + Ua.s.{ log n/(nh)}

which imply that XTWX can be written as

 f (x) diag(1, h)[diag {1, µ2(K)} + U (h) + Ua.s.{ log n/(nh)}] diag(1, h).

Finally, the inverse of this matrix is concluded as this lemma. ()

L { (x) | (Xij, Ni) , 1  j  Ni, 1  i  n} = N (0, 1) ,

Further, since ralt = r1,0 (t, al) = 0, v2 = r1,1 (t, t) for t  [al + 2, bl], see (A.19), one can simplify

(A.26) as

Aza®is and Wschebor (2009) p.96, we denote

µ1 = E { (s) | (t) =  (s) = u } , µ2 = E { (t) | (t) =  (s) = u } ,

(A.39)

12 = Var { (s) | (t) =  (s) = u } , 22 = Var { (t) | (t) =  (s) = u } .

(A.40)

Next, we claim that while 0 < |s - t| <  , µ1 and µ2 have opposite signs. In fact, if 0 < |s - t| < , by

(A.22), for large n, r1,0 (t, s)  (t - s) and r1.0 (s, t)  (s - t) and by (A.21), inf|t-s|< (1 + r)  c > 0,

which imply that µ1µ2 < 0, see (A.33). Further, according to (A.25), (A.33) and (A.34), for large n,  constant L2 > such that inf|t-s|<2,t,s[0,h-1] |µ2| 2-1  L2u. Without loss of generality, by (A.39) and

It follows from (A.22) and (A.23) that for large enough n,  constants L3, L4, L5, K2 > 0 such that

sup E Uu [al, bl][2] = O{ (u) n} .

Similarly,

has

and

then

sup E (Uu [al, bl] + D- u [al, bl])[2] = O{ (u) n} .

In fact, by Lemma A.1, (A.31) and (A.42) show that, as n  ,

 P{supIl | (t)| > u} = 2 C (K) (u)  (0) n + O{ (u) n} .

(A.42) (A.43)

Finally, since E  (t)  (s) = 0 while t  Il, s  Im, l = m, then  (t) ,  (s) for t  Il, s  Im, l = m

are independent Gaussian processes and hence

 Since 2 C (K)N n (u)  (0)  - log (1 - ) as n  , then it follows from the definitions of

N, n, un that limn P{supNl=1Il | (t)|  u} = 1 - . 
The quantile Qh () given in (3.5) satisfies 2 C (K)N n {Qh ()}  (0)  - log (1 - ), as n  ,

then Lemmas A.12 and A.13 imply that limn P{sup[0,1] | (x)|  Qh ()} = 1 - , i.e.,

[  ]

lim P

ah{sup[0,1] | (x)| - ah} - log{

 In particular, sup[0,1] | (x)| = Op( log n).

LEMMA A.14. Under Assumptions (A1)-(A6), let 3,n (x) = n (x) n-1 (x) - 1,x  [0, 1], then

Proof. It follows from the definition of  (x) given in (A.16) that |3,n (x)| = n (x) n-1 (x) - 1  n2 (x) n-2 (x) - 1 in which

 n2 (x) = f -2 (x) Dx-2 (K) NT-1{NT-1 i,j Ri2j,(x) + NT-1 k,i Ri2k,k (x)}.

 Ua.s.{ log

 which implies that n2 (x) n-2 (x) = 1 + Ua.s.{ log n/(nh2)} and hence this lemma holds.

Proof Of Proposition 3.1. The proof is trivial.

Proof Of Theorem 3.1. The decomposition (A.2) implies that

n-1 (x) {m (x) - m (x)} = n-1 (x) {m (x) - m (x)} + n-1 (x) e(x).

(A.45)

 As (A.44) implies that sup[0,1] | (x)| = Op( log n), Lemma A.14 leads to

sup[0,1] n-1 (x)

 NT (x) + k=1 k (x)

 = Op( log n).

and hence by Lemma A.9, sup[0,1] n-1 (x)



(x)

k=1

k

(x)

 = Op( log n). Therefore, Lemma A.8

implies that

sup[0,1] n-1 (x)



e(x) - { (x) +

k=1

 = Op{h log n + log 2n/ (nh2)}.

(A.46)

It follows from (A.46), Lemmas A.9 and A.14 that for t > 2/5 (assumption A5 ),

sup[0,1]

n-1 (x) |e(x)| - | (x)|

=

 Op{h log

2n/

24 S. ZHENG, L. YANG AND W. K. HA® RDLE Further, (A.46) and Lemma (A.7) warrants that

sup[0,1] n-1 (x) |m (x) - m (x)| - | (x)| =

Op{nh5/2

+

 h log

n

+

 log

2n/

(nh2)

(A.47)

and therefore
