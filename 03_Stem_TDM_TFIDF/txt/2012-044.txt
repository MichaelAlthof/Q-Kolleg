Copula-Based Dynamic Conditional Correlation Multiplicative Error Processes

Abstract
We introduce a copula-based dynamic model for multivariate processes of (non-negative) high-frequency trading variables revealing time-varying conditional variances and correlations. Modeling the variables' conditional mean processes using a multiplicative error model we map the resulting residuals into a Gaussian domain using a Gaussian copula. Based on high-frequency volatility, cumulative trading volumes, trade counts and market depth of various stocks traded at the NYSE, we show that the proposed copula-based transformation is supported by the data and allows disentangling (multivariate) dynamics in higher order moments. To capture the latter, we propose a DCC-GARCH specification. We suggest estimating the model by composite maximum likelihood which is sufficiently flexible to be applicable in high dimensions. Strong empirical evidence for time-varying conditional (co-)variances in trading processes supports the usefulness of the approach. Taking these higher-order dynamics explicitly into account significantly improves the goodness-of-fit of the multiplicative error model and allows capturing time-varying liquidity risks.

1 Introduction
The modeling of intraday trading processes has become a major area in financial econometrics. This is particularly triggered by technological progress on financial markets, changing institutional structures in the trading landscape and a growing importance of intraday trading. The availability of financial data on the lowest possible aggregation level opens up the possibility to gain a deeper understanding of financial trading processes and to successfully manage trading risks, trading costs and intraday price risks.
This paper contributes to the literature on multivariate models for trading processes. We propose a model capturing trading dynamics not only in first conditional moments but also in conditional (co-)variances. The latter reflect time-varying uncertainty inherent in intraday trading processes as well as dynamic correlation structures between key trading variables. The major idea is to map innovations in (non-negative) dynamic trading processes into a Gaussian domain using a Gaussian copula. The innovations stem from a vector multiplicative error model (VMEM) as proposed by Manganelli (2005) and Cipollini, Engle, and Gallo (2007). The copula-based Gaussian transformation of observations allows identifying non-linear dependencies between trading variables and yields a natural separation of (multivariate) dynamics in first and second conditional moments. The latter are conveniently captured using dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) models as proposed by Engle (2002a). The proposed approach is sufficiently flexible to be applicable in high dimensions and can be extended in various directions.
Multiplicative error models (MEMs) ≠ labeled according to Engle (2002b) ≠ are workhorses for the modeling of dynamic processes of non-negative random variables, such as trading volumes, volatilities, trading intensities or market depth. The principle of decomposing a process into the product of its conditional mean and a positive-valued error term is well known in the literature and builds the backbone of the autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH) model by Engle (1982) and the stochastic volatility (SV) model introduced by Taylor (1982). In high-frequency econometrics, it is put forward by Engle and Russell (1998) to model the dynamics of trade-to-trade durations and is referred to as autoregressive conditional duration (ACD) model.1
A difficulty in the modeling of non-negative random variables is that typical distributions, such as the exponential distribution or generalizations thereof, imply a direct relationship between all moments. Accordingly, a MEM process implies that higher order (conditional) mo-

ments follow the same dynamics which, however, is not necessarily supported by the data. To address this problem, Ghysels, Gourie¥roux, and Jasiak (1998) propose a two-factor model allowing for separate dynamics of the conditional mean and the conditional variance. Their principle is to rewrite an exponential model with gamma heterogeneity in terms of two Gaussian factors following a bi-variate dynamic process. Though this model accounts for features in trading variables which are not captured by a basic MEM, it imposes (partly restrictive) distributional assumptions and is hard to estimate. In a multivariate setting, the situation is even more complicate as not only conditional variance dynamics but also time-varying correlation structures have to be taken into account. However, finding a sufficiently flexible multivariate distribution defined on positive support is a difficult task. As discussed by Cipollini, Engle, and Gallo (2007), a possible candidate is a multivariate gamma distribution which however imposes severe restrictions on the contemporaneous correlations between the variables.
This paper's contribution is to capture higher-order dependence structures using a copulabased decomposition of dynamics. Capturing conditional mean dynamics using a VMEM specification, the resulting residuals serve as serially uncorrelated innovations whose multivariate distribution is modeled using a copula. Employing a Gaussian copula has two major advantages: First, the copula allows to straightforwardly link the individual marginal distributions to an appropriate joint distribution. Moreover, the imposed normality enables naturally disentangling first and second conditional moments. Furthermore, the mapping into a Gaussian domain allows identifying non-linear (cross-)dependencies in trading processes which are not identifiable using a basic (linear) VMEM. The dynamics in resulting transformed innovations are naturally captured using (V)ARMA-GARCH and DCC-type specifications. This makes the model quite flexible and applicable in high dimensions. Accordingly, we suggest a composite maximum likelihood estimation procedure which is also feasible for high-dimensional processes.
We apply the model to 5-min squared mid-quote returns, cumulative trading volumes, trade counts as well as market depth of different stocks traded at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). We show that the Gaussian copula and thus the normality-induced separation between first and second conditional moments is well supported by the data. It turns out that VMEM innovations still reveal substantial dependencies in higher moments which are only identifiable after the application of the Gaussian copula. It turns out that the explicit consideration of these dependencies lead to a significantly better fit in terms of information criteria.
Our study shows that trading variables are subject to time-varying conditional variances reflecting liquidity and volatility risk. The processes are quite persistent and reveal positive cross-
3

dependencies. Hence, uncertainty in volatility as well as liquidity demand and supply tends to spill over from one variable to another. Moreover, we show that conditional correlations between liquidity and volatility variables substantially vary over time. These insights are interesting from a microstructure and trading perspective as they allow identifying periods where connections between liquidity demand, liquidity supply and volatility are particularly high or low, respectively. Residual diagnostics show that the proposed approach explains the multivariate dynamics in trading processes clearly better than a basic (linear) VMEM specification.
The proposed copula-based dynamic conditional correlation MEM complements the existing literature on multiplicative error processes and the modeling of intraday trading. Various aspects which have been addressed in extant literature can be included in our approach. For instance, latent factor approaches in the spirit of Bauwens and Veredas (2004) and Hautsch (2008), component MEMS, as proposed by Brownlees, Cipollini, and Gallo (2010) or Brownlees and Vannucci (2010), long memory dynamics, as put forward by Jasiak (1998) and Karanasos (2004), or regime-switching MEMs as in Zhang, Russell, and Tsay (2001) or Meitz and Tera®svirta (2006) could easily be included in the basic (V)MEM specification. Likewise, the included DCC-GARCH component could be further extended by recent advances in the literature on multivariate GARCH models (see, e.g., Bauwens, Laurent, and Rombouts (2006)). Finally, our approach contributes to the empirical literature on dynamic copula models, see, e.g., Patton (2001) and Patton (2006), or on copula-based multivariate GARCH processes as suggested by Jondeau and Rockinger (2006), Lee and Long (2009) and Liu and Luger (2009). A study related to ours is Cipollini, Engle, and Gallo (2007) who also suggest copulas in a (V)MEM setup but proceed differently.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the basic vector multiplicative error model. Section 3 introduces the new copula-based approach. In Section 4, we provide an empirical application to the modeling of high-frequency trading processes. Finally, Section 5 concludes.
2 The Basic Multiplicative Error Model
Let {Xt}, t = 1, ..., T , denote a non-negative valued random process and let Ft define the information set up to time t. The basic univariate multiplicative error model (MEM), as introduced
4

by Engle (2002b), is given by
Xt = µtt , t|Ft-1  i.i.d. D(1, 2) ,
where {µt} is a non-negative random predictable process with respect to Ft-1 and represents the conditional mean of Xt. The class of MEMs is quite general and nests various special cases. For instance, Bollerslev's (1986) generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity model is obtained by letting Xt be the squared de-meaned log return Yt with µt being its conditional variance, i.e., Yt2 = µtt2 or, alternatively, Yt = µtt with t|Ft-1  i.i.d.(0, 1). Another important special case of the univariate MEM is the autoregressive conditional duration (ACD) model proposed by Engle and Russell (1998), where Xt corresponds to a financial duration.
The conditional mean µt can be parameterized in various ways. In its most simple form, it is specified as

µt =  + 1Xt-1 + 1µt-1,

(1)

corresponding to an ARMA(1,1) process for Xt with (martingale difference) error term Xt - µt. Exploiting the analogy to a GARCH process, (univariate) MEMs can be extended in various ways. For a recent overview, see Hautsch (2012).
Multivariately extending the MEM yields the so-called vector multiplicative error model (VMEM) given by

Xt = µt t,

(2)

where Xt := (X1,t, ..., XK,t) , µt := E[Xt|Ft-1] = (µ1,t, ..., µK,t) is a K ◊ 1 vector, ' ' denotes the Hadamard product (element-wise multiplication) and t is a K-dimensional vector of mutually and serially i.i.d. innovation processes, where the j-th element is given by

j,t|Ft-1  Dj(1, j2).

(3)

Manganelli (2005) suggests specifying µt as

PQ
µt =  + A0Xt + ApXt-p + Bqµt-q,
p=1 q=1

(4)

where  is a K-dimensional vector and A0, Ap, Bq are K ◊ K parameter matrices. The matrix

A0 captures the contemporaneous dependence of the elements of Xt and is specified as a matrix

5

where only the upper triangular elements are non-zero. Consequently, Xi,t is predetermined for all variables Xj,t, j < i, and is conditionally i.i.d. given {Xj,t, Ft-1}, j < i.
The disadvantage of this structure is the requirement of imposing an explicit ordering of the variables in Xt induced by the triangular structure. The latter is not easy to justify in most applications. Accordingly, mutual dependencies are likely to be misspecified. This problem becomes even more severe when the dimension of the underlying process is high. An alternative way to capture contemporaneous relationships is to allow for mutual correlations between the innovation terms i,t. Then, the innovation terms follow a density function which is defined over non-negative K-dimensional support [0, +)K with unit mean  and covariance matrix , i.e.,

t|Ft-1  i.i.d. D(, )

implying

E [Xt|Ft-1] = µt, V [Xt|Ft-1] = µtµt

.

However, finding an appropriate distribution D is a difficult task. Typical distributions for positive-valued random variables impose direct relationships between all moments. To break up this dependence, Ghysels, Gourie¥roux, and Jasiak (2004) propose a two-factor model which allows estimating separate dynamics for the conditional variance of durations ('duration volatilities') leading to the so-called Stochastic Volatility Duration model. In a multivariate context, the separation between first and second (conditional) moments is even more challenging. As discussed by Cipollini, Engle, and Gallo (2007), a possible candidate for D is a multivariate gamma distribution which, however, imposes severe restrictions on the contemporaneous correlations between the errors j,t.
Below we propose a copula-based approach which (i) allows to separately model first and second moments and (ii) is tractable and feasible even in high dimensions.

3 Copula-Based Dynamic Conditional Correlation Multiplicative Error Processes
3.1 The Model
The major idea is to find an appropriate transformation of t which allows disentangling first and second moments. Such a transformation step is in the spirit of Ghysels, Gourie¥roux, and Jasiak
6

(2004) who propose rewriting an exponential model with gamma heterogeneity in terms a twofactor formulation based on Gaussian factors. The latter are individually modeled using standard time series approaches. However, the disadvantage of the so-called Stochastic Volatility Duration model is that it is computationally expensive and difficult to be generalized to a multivariate setting.
As an alternative we suggest a transformation step which is computationally tractable (and thus feasible for large data sets) and also easily applicable in high dimensions. The conditional mean of Xt is specified according to a simplified version of (4),

Xt = µt t,
PQ
µt =  + ApXt-p + Bqµt-q,
p=1 q=1

(5)

with the elements of t being uncorrelated (but not independent). Note that (5) excludes contem-

poraneous dependencies between the elements of Xt (in contrast to (4)), as they are exclusively

captured by mutual dependencies in j,t. The major principle is to transform t to the vector t using a Gaussian copula, i.e.,

t := (-1(F1(1,t)), ..., -1(FK (K,t))) ,

(6)

where (.) denotes the c.d.f. of the univariate standard normal distribution and Fj(.) denotes the marginal cumulative distribution function associated with Dj. The assumption of the Gaussian copula implies that the transformed residuals t are by construction conditionally normally distributed,

t|Ft-1  N (µt, DtRtDt),

(7)

with µt denoting the conditional mean, Rt denoting the conditional correlation matrix and Dt are K ◊ K diagonal matrices with the conditional volatilities hj1,/t2, j = 1, . . . K, as diagonal elements.
The transformation underlying the Gaussian copula can be interpreted as a mapping of an observation Xt from the support of D1 ◊ D2 ◊ .... ◊ DK on the support of the marginal c.d.f. of
a K-dimensional normal distribution with the respective quantiles being equal. Since the transformation from t to t is non-linear (though monotone), the series {t } as well as {t 2} might be autocorrelated while the {t} themselves are uncorrelated. Indeed, the existence of dynamics in t and t 2 indicate the presence of higher-order dynamics in t which are not captured by the plain MEM specification. Likewise, non-zero (conditional) correlations between j,t,

7

j = 1, . . . , K, reflect the presence of (time-varying) mutual dependencies between MEM errors.

Clearly, the adequacy of the Gaussian copula has to be empirically validated by testing the normality of t. Our empirical findings below show that this assumption is well supported by typical high-frequency time series.

A mapping into the Gaussian domain has the advantage of fully describing all dependencies

in terms of the first two conditional moments of the transformed error process. As a result, time-

variations in higher-order dependencies can be conveniently captured by dynamic conditional

variance and correlation processes bringing well-known time series approaches into play. Indeed,

such a modeling strategy is not feasible if it is directly applied to t as the amount of information presented in {t} is not revealed without appropriately transforming {t}.
To capture possible dynamics in the first two conditional moments of t , we propose an VAR-(M)GARCH parameterization given by

Q
t = µt + t =: Cj t-j + t,
j=1

(8)

t = ht t,
Ph
ht = h + Ahj (t-j
j=1

Qh
t-j ) + Bjhht-j ,
j=1

(9) (10)

where Cj, Ajh and Bjh are K ◊ K parameter matrices. Correspondingly, ht is a K-vector of conditional variances hj,t, j = 1, . . . , K, of t and t is a K-vector with t|Ft-1  N (0, Rt).
Obviously, hi,t is not the conditional variance of i,t but the conditional variance of its projec-

tion into a Gaussian domain. Nevertheless, it can be seen as an approximation of the conditional

variance of i,t reflecting normalized fluctuations around the conditional mean. As the underlying transformation is monotonous and increasing, a higher (lower) volatility in the process {t } also indicates a higher (lower) volatility in the process {t}.

The conditional correlation matrix Rt is modeled according to Engle's (2002a) Dynamic

Conditional Correlation (DCC) model and is given by

Rt = Qt -1QtQt -1,

Qt = (1 - j - j)QØ + jt-jt-j + jQt-j,

These conditions ensure the weak stationarity of {t} and {t}. Weak stationarity of {t} is

guaranteed by the existence of the first two moments of {t}. Then, the process {t} is obtained

from {t } by applying a time-invariant transformation, guaranteeing the weak stationarity of the

process {t}. Finally, the weak stationarity of {Xt} is satisfied by the weak stationarity of {µt}

requiring all eigenvalues of the matrix

Then, the conditional moments of Xt are given by

E[Xt|Ft-1] = µt, V[Xj,t|Ft-1] = µj2,tj2 , Cov(Xi,t, Xj,t|Ft-1) = µi,tµj,tCov(i,t, j,t|Ft-1)
= µi,tµj,tCov(Fi-1((i,t)), Fj-1((j,t))|Ft-1)

Note that the last integral cannot be evaluated analytically but can be easily computed numerically.

The structure of the likelihood function (15) motivates the application of a multi-step com-

posite likelihood procedure. Let the symbol vec denote the vec-operator and  := (0, 1) with

0 := ( , vec(A1) , ..., vec(AP ) , vec(B1) , ..., vec(BQ) ) 1 := (vec(C1) , ..., vec(CQ) , h, vec(A1h) , ..., vec(APh h) , vec(Bh1 ) , ..., vec(BhQh) ,
1, ..., P R , 1, ..., QR )

being the parameters of the plain VECM and VAR-(M)GARCH part of the model, respectively.

Accordingly, the likelihood function of the extended VECM process consists of K + 1 (con-

ditional) components. The first K components are specified by the conditional distribution of

each component of Xt given Ft-1 and are fully determined by the parameter vector 0 and the distribution functions Fj(.), j = 1, ..., K. The (K + 1)-th component is given by the conditional distribution of the VAR-(M)GARCH part, i.e., by the conditional distribution of qt, which is a conditional normal distribution with conditional mean vector µ = C(L)qt and conditional covariance matrix DtRtDt. Using this presentation we adopt a two stage procedure. To compute l0, we choose fj(.), j = 1, . . . , K as the densities of (conditional) exponential distributions. Accordingly, we have

ignoring any constants. Maximizing l0 yields estimates of 0. Exploiting the quasi-likelihood property of the exponential distribution (see, e.g., Engle (2000)), 0 and consequently first-stage

10

MEM residuals are consistently estimated. In the second stage, 1 is estimated using MEM

residuals. The unknown distribution functions Fj(.) of j,t are replaced by the rescaled univariate

are used to estimate 1. Consequently,

ln(K (C(L)^t , DtRtDt; ^t ))

is maximized over 1. Under some regularity conditions (see e.g. White (1996) and Engle

and Sheppard (2001)), it can be shown that the suggested two-stage estimator is consistent and

asymptotically normally distributed. For more details on composite likelihood approaches, see,

e.g., Lindsay (1988), Joe (1997), Joe (2005) or Ng, Joe, Karlis, and Liu (2011).

4 Modeling High-Frequency Volatility and Liquidity
4.1 Data
We apply the model to five stocks traded at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in 2006. To provide cross-sectional evidence across different liquidity classes, we choose the tickers AIG, Citigroup, Boeing, ASH and AMR. AIG and Citigroup belong to the biggest financial and insurance companies in the U.S., Boeing is one of the biggest multinational aerospace and defense companies, ASH represents Ashland Inc., a chemical and petroleum company while AMR Corporation is an aviation and airline holding company. We apply the model to equi-distant data and focus on 5-min aggregates. This allows analyzing a sufficiently long period (one year) without facing too much computational burden. As the variables of interest, we choose a volatility proxy, computed as the squared residual of an ARMA(1,1) regression of 5-min log mid-quote returns. Moreover, we use the cumulated trading volume, the number of trades as well as the time-weighted average depth on the ask and bid level. All variables are seasonally adjusted by standardizing them by a cubic spline sj,t, j = 1, . . . , K, based on 30-min nodes covering the trading day from 9:30 to 16:00. Table 1 in the Appendix gives summary statistics of the underlying 5-min returns, scaled to an annual level, cumulative trading volumes, number of trades and average first-level depth (in number of round lots). We observe a high variability of returns which is becoming even higher in case of less liquid assets. For instance, if the 5-min returns would be scaled to an annual level, we would observe standard deviations of around 20. Substantial variations are also observed for cumulative trading volumes which, however, are obviously
11

driven by underlying lot sizes. In terms of the number of trades, Citigroup and AIG are most intensively traded with on average approximately 45 trades per 5 minutes. Conversely, Boeing and AMR represent less liquid assets with on average approximately 34 trades per interval while ASH reveals the lowest liquidity trading on average 20 times per 5 minutes. As reflected by the Ljung-Box statistics, all series are strongly autocorrelated suggesting a dynamic model.
4.2 Estimation Results
We apply the model to the stock characteristics Xt with elements X1,t (volatility proxy, computed as the squared residual of an ARMA(1,1) regression of 5-min log mid-quote returns), X2,t (cumulative trading volumes), X3,t (number of trades), X4,t (average first-level depth) for t = 1, ..., T . The estimates of the underlying VMEM specification are given in Table 3. The lag orders are chosen using the Bayes Information Criterion (BIC) suggesting a VMEM(3,1) specification yielding the best fit. All processes are dominantly driven by their own histories implying the diagonal elements of A1 being largest and most significant. Nevertheless, also significant evidence for dynamic spill-overs between the individual variables is shown. We observe positive intertemporal dependencies between volatility and liquidity demand, i.e., high volatilities induce high trading volumes and trading intensities and vice versa. The same is true for the relationship between cumulative trading volumes and the number of trades. This is not surprising as there is an inherent link between cumulated volumes and the number of trades per time. Conversely, liquidity supply ≠ as reflected by the pending depth on the first level ≠ is negatively linked to volatility. Hence, in periods of high volatility, liquidity suppliers tend to reduce order aggressiveness and thus post less depth on the first level. This is in strong accordance with predictions from market microstructure theory, see, e.g., Glosten (1994). In contrast, there is a positive intertemporal relationship between liquidity supply and liquidity demand: A high liquidity demand ≠ reflected by high trading volumes ≠ increases execution probabilities of limit orders and thus rises liquidity suppliers' willingness to post more depth. On the other hand, a higher liquidity supply also triggers liquidity demand as the transaction costs of high volumes decline. Interestingly, this link does not necessarily hold for the relationship between depth and the number of trades which is negative in most cases. Hence, a high liquidity supply particularly triggers higher trade sizes but not necessarily a higher speed of trading. Likewise, a higher trading intensity tends to reduce first level depth. The estimates of A^ 2 and A^ 3 are negative reflecting some reversal effects in subsequent periods. As reflected by B^ , the processes are very persistent which is typical for high-frequency trading variables, see, e.g., Hautsch (2012). The Ljung-Box statistics
12

of the resulting MEM residuals ^t shown in Table 2 indicate that the specification captures the dynamics quite well. We observe that the Ljung-Box statistics are strongly reduced compared to the corresponding statistics for the raw data shown in Table 1.
However, while dependencies in first moments seem to be successfully captured by the VMEM specification, dependencies in higher order moments are still present. This is reflected by quite high Ljung-Box statistics based on the residuals ^t resulting from the Gaussian copula transformation (6). We observe that the mapping of MEM residuals into a Gaussian domain reveals serial dependencies which are not captured by a (linear) VMEM specification for plain variables. The presence of autocorrelations in transformed residuals provide hints on the existence of non-linearities in serial dependencies in trading characteristics. As the Gaussian copula transformation induces a mapping from R+ to R and thus particularly affects small realizations of ^t, the autocorrelations in these residuals are presumably driven by distinct dependencies in unexpectedly small values of trading variables. These differences in dynamics of small and large realizations of volatility and liquidity variables might be captured by a ≠ presumably complicate ≠ non-linear VMEM specification for the trading variables directly. Nevertheless, even a highly flexible non-linear VMEM specification is probably unable to explain the strong dependencies in second moments of ^t as revealed by the corresponding Ljung-Box statistics.
Table 4 shows the estimates of the VAR specification (8) based on ^t . Note that the reported standard errors do not explicitly account for the estimation errors in the previous stages. We justify this proceeding by the high number of observations yielding quite precise estimates of VMEM residuals and thus Fj.2 As suggested by the BIC and the Ljung-Box statistics of the resulting residuals t (Table 2), three lags are sufficient to capture the autocorrelations in ^t . We do not observe a particular dominance of dependencies on own histories but find that dependencies across the different trading characteristics are equally important. Hence, the copula transformation reveals evidence also for non-linear dependencies between the individual variables. However, the multivariate Ljung-Box statistics reported in Table 2 show that the VAR models does successfully remove both autocorrelations and cross-autocorrelations in the series.
For some series (particularly trading intensities) the Ljung-Box statistics of squared residuals ^t2 and ^t2 indicate even stronger dependencies in second moments than in first moments. As discussed above, the latter are associated with conditional variances of (normalized) trading variables and reflect the time-varying volatility of volatility and liquidity. These dynamics are

captured by the GARCH specification (10). The corresponding estimates based on fully speci-

fied matrices A1h and Bh1 of the lag order one are shown in Table 5. We find significant presence of (G)ARCH effects. This is most strongly seen if only diagonal specifications are estimated3.

In the multivariate specification, however, these effects are overlaid by multi-collinearity effects

reducing the significance of the innovation parameter estimates. Nevertheless, as also revealed by the estimates of Bh1 , we find significant evidence for positive volatility spill-overs between all processes. Hence, the volatilities of volatility, liquidity demand and liquidity supply are cross-

correlated and moderately persistent over time. I.e., volatility shocks in liquidity demand ≠ as

reflected by an unexpectedly high or low trading intensity or market depth ≠ spill over to other

trading variables and increase uncertainty in liquidity supply and volatility and vice versa. These

are states of the market where trading risks are high and trading costs are hard to predict. The

(see

reflect

that

the

(M)GARCH specification is able to capture these dependencies.

Nevertheless,

the

fact

that

the

statistics

on

are

significant,

reflects

that

dynamics in second moments are still not completely taken into account asking for a presumably

even more flexible specification. Finally, as shown by the estimates of the DCC parameters, we

find significant evidence for dynamics in conditional correlations between (transformed) trading variables. Estimates of ^ being close to one indicate a high persistence in correlation processes

≠ very similar to that of daily asset return correlations. The residuals stemming from the DCC

process

are

computed

based

on

the

Not

surprisingly,

the

statistics

of



 t

are

very

similar

to

those

of

t

showing

that

dependencies

in

first

moments are removed while slight dependencies in second moments are still present. Never-

theless, it turns out that the DCC specification is successful in removing the mutual correlations

between the series. This is revealed by applying John's test for zero mutual correlation based

on the empirical distance between the sample covariance matrix and a diagonal matrix (John

(1971)). The corresponding test statistic is given by

1 S2

TJ

=

tr K

-I (1/K )tr(S)

,

(20)

where S is the sample covariance matrix based on the residual series. As shown by Ledoit and Wolf (2002), the asymptotic (2) distribution of the test statistic is also valid if the cross-sectional dimension K relative to the sample size T becomes high. Table 2 reports that the test statistics are strongly reduced by the DCC specification.

To check the adequacy of the Gaussian copula, we test the normality of the residual series.

trading. We compare the kernel density estimates with the density of a normal distribution fitted

to the corresponding series. Not surprisingly, for {t}, the kernel density estimates significantly depart from the correspondingly fitted normal distribution. Conversely, the distribution of {t} is visually hardly distinguishable from Gaussianity. The results are representative for the other

residual series as well as for all other stocks. To formally test for normality, we apply a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test based on t. As shown
by Table 6, normality cannot be rejected for nearly all series. The only exception is observed for

the residual series stemming from trade counts where the assumption of normality is rejected in

four out of five cases. Nevertheless, overall empirical evidence strongly supports the normality

of transformed residuals and thus backs the usefulness of a Gaussian copula. To test for the joint

normality of the individual series, we test the distribution of the statistic

t = 1,t2 + 2,t2 + 3,t2 + 4,t2

against a 2-distribution with 4 degrees of freedom. Corresponding quantile-quantile (QQ)plots along with associated p-values of Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics are depicted by Figure 2. The plots reveal close correspondance of theoretical and empirical quantiles for major parts of the distributions. However, deviations are depicted for extreme observations in the right tails. Consequently, joint normality of all series in form of a 42 distribution for t cannot be rejected on a 1% level only. This is presumably driven by deviations from Gaussianity for the series of trade counts and very few extreme observations whose distributional properties are hard to capture. Finally, Table 7 gives the values of the likelihood function and the Bayes Information Criteria (BIC) for the basic and extended VMEM specifications. It turns out that the model's goodnessof-fit is clearly improved when dynamics in higher order moments are taken into account.
Figure 3 plots the estimated conditional variances ht and conditional correlations Rt of t for the stock AIG. We observe significant short-term and long-term movements of conditional variances over time. Induced by the positive spill-overs, we observe that the series tend to move in lock-steps. This is particularly true for the volatilities of midquote volatility and of cumulative trade sizes. As depicted by Figure 4, the conditional correlations between the individual series reveal significant time variations as well. Not surprisingly, the highest (positive) correlations are shown between cumulative volumes and and trade counts which are correlated by construction.

15

Likewise, positive mutual dependencies are identified between midquote volatility and cumulative volumes as well as trade counts. Confirming the VMEM estimates above, dependencies between first level depth and volatility as well as trade counts tend to be negative or close to zero, respectively. Hence, liquidity supply is reduced when volatility and the number of trades are high. Conversely, liquidity supply is positively autocorrelated with cumulative trading volumes confirming the positive dependencies between liquidity demand and supply.
5 Conclusions
In this paper, we propose extending a VMEM model to capture dynamics in conditional (co-) variances of multivariate trading processes. The key idea is to transform innovations stemming from a VMEM specification using a Gaussian copula. The mapping into a Gaussian domain allows to naturally disentagle dynamics in first and second conditional moments. We propose modeling the latter using a DCC-GARCH process which is tractable also in high dimensions. The model is estimated using a composite maximum likelihood approach and is easily extended in various directions.
Applying the new approach to model 5 min volatility, cumulative trading volumes, trade counts as well as first level depth based on various stocks traded at the NYSE, we show the following results. Firstly, the proposed Gaussian copula is empirically supported by the data as the normality of transformed VMEM innovations cannot be rejected in most cases. Secondly, we find significant evidence for non-linear (cross-)dependencies between trading variables. Third, trading variables reveal time-varying conditional variances reflecting the riskiness in liquidity supply, demand and volatility. The processes are persistent and are subject to positive crossdependencies. I.e., uncertainty in trading characteristics easily spills over between the individual components. Fourth, we find time-varying and persistent conditional correlations between the processes. Fifth, according to information criteria and residual diagnostics, the copula-based multiplicative error process yields a better goodness-of-fit and a better description of higherorder dynamics in multivariate trading processes.
