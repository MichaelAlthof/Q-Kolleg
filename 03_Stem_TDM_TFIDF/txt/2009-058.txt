Polar sets of anisotropic Gaussian random fields

November 13, 2009
Abstract This paper studies polar sets of anisotropic Gaussian random fields, i.e. sets which a Gaussian random field does not hit almost surely. The main assumptions are that the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix are bounded from below and that the canonical metric associated with the Gaussian random field is dominated by an anisotropic metric. We deduce an upper bound for the hitting probabilities and conclude that sets with small Hausdorff dimension are polar. Moreover, the results allow for a translation of the Gaussian random field by a random field, that is independent of the Gaussian random field and whose sample functions are of bounded H¨older norm.

1 Introduction
Anisotropic Gaussian random fields arise naturally in stochastic partial differential equations, image processing, mathematical finance and other areas.
RLet X = {X(t)|t  I  N } be a centered Gaussian random field with valRues in d, where I is bounded. We will call X an (N, d)-Gaussian random
field. The distance in the canonical metric associated with the Gaussian random field is E [ X(s) - X(t) 2], where · denotes the Euclidean metric. Polar sets of Gaussian random fields are investigated in [5] under the assumptions that the components are independent copies of the same random field,

that the variance is constant and that E [ X(s) - X(t) 2]  c s - t 

holds with constants c,  > 0. The recent works [7] and [2] consider the

anisotropic metric

N
(s, t) := |sj - tj|Hj

(1)

j=1

with H ]0, 1]N and assume E [ X(s) - X(t) 2]  c(s, t). In addition

they require for the variance only to be bounded from below. In this paper

the assumptions on the variance and on the independent copies in the com-

ponents are substituted by the milder assumption that the eigenvalues of the

covariance matrix are bounded from below. The random fields in the com-

ponents neither need to be identical distributed nor independent. Hence, we

require weaker assumptions on the dependency structure of the components

of the Gaussian random field than [5], [7] and [2]. It follows from an upper

bound on the hitting probabilities of X that sets with Hausdorff dimension

smaller than d -

N j=1

1/Hj

are polar.

Our results

allow for

a

translation

of the Gaussian random field X by a random field, that is independent of

X and whose sample functions are Lipschitz continuous with respect to the

metric .

As an application we show that an estimator in [1], which calibrates an

exponential L´evy model by option data, is almost surely well-defined.

2 Main results

Let X be an (N, d)-Gaussian random field. Recall that we suppose the index set I to be bounded. We will assume the following two conditions.

Condition 1. There is a constant c > 0 such that for all s, t  I we have E [ X(s) - X(t) 2]  c(s, t).

Condition 2. There is a constant  > 0 such that for all t  I and for all

Re 

d with e = 1 we have E[(

d j=1

ej

Xj (t))2 ]



.

Condition 1 bounds the canonical metric in terms of the anisotropic metric . Condition 2 bounds the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix from below. It excludes, for example, cases where X takes values only in some vector subspace.
We will use a uniform modulus of continuity, see (69) in [7, p. 167]. We restate this result in the next inequality. A weaker formulation suffices for our purpose and is proved in the Appendix. Let X be an (N, d)-Gaussian random field, that satisfies Condition 1. Then there is a version X of X and a constant c~ > 0 such that almost surely the following inequality holds:

lim sup sup

X (s) - X (t)  c~.

0 s,tI,(s,t)

log( -1)

We will always assume that X is a version, which satisfies (2). We
Rdefine by Lip(L) := {f : I  d| f (s) - f (t)  L(s, t) s, t  I} the
L-Lipschitz functions with respect to the metric . In each direction j the
Rfunctions in Lip(L) are Ho¨lder continuous with exponent Hj. We denote
by B(t, r) := {s  N |(s, t)  r} the closed ball of radius r around t.
Lemma 1. Let X be an (N, d)-Gaussian random field, that satisfies Conditions 1 and 2. Then for each L  0 there is a constant C > 0 such that for all t  I, for all r > 0 and for all functions f  Lip(L) we have

P inf X(s) - f (s)  r  Crd.
sB(t,r)I

(3)

Proof. For all integers n  1 we define n := r exp(-2n+1) and denote by

Nn := N(B(t, r)I, n) the covering number, that is the minimum number

of -balls with radii n and centers in B(t, r)  I that are needed to cover

B(t, r)  I. We have the inclusion B(t, r)  Nj=1[tj - r1/Hj , tj + r1/Hj ].

On the other hand each set Nj=1[sj, sj + ( n/N )1/Hj ] can be covered by a

single ball with radius n. Hence there is a constant c1 > 0 independent of n such that Nn  Nj=1((2rN/ n)(1/Hj) + 1)  c1 exp(Q2n+1) where

Q=

N j=1

1/Hj

.

We denote by {t(in)  B(t, r)  I|1  i  Nn} a set of points such that the balls with the centers {ti(n)} and radii n cover B(t, r)  I. We define

n+1
rn :=  n2 2 ,

where  > c~ is some constant to be determined later. For all integers n, k  1 and 1  i  Nk, we define the following events

where the last equality only holds for n  2. We will show that the prob-

ability in (3) can be dominated by the limit of the probabilities of the sets A(n)

For all s  B(t, r)  I and all n  1 there exists in such that (s, t(inn))  n. By (2) we obtain almost surely

by

 > L/2. The idea is to rewrite X(ti(n)) - X(ti(n-1)) as a sum of two terms,

one expressed by X(t(in)) and the other independent of X(t(in)).

Lip(L) is invariant under orthogonal transformations. By the spectral

theorem we may choose new coordinates such that the covariance matrix

at ti(n) is diagonal. Then the components of X(t(in)) are independent. By assumption j(s) := E [Xj(s)2] > 0. We define the standard normal

random variables

Yj (s)

:=

Xj(s) . j (s)

Note that E[Y (t(in))Y (ti(n)) ] = Id holds. If E (Xj(s) - Xj(t))2

define

Yj(s, t) :=

Xj(s) - Xj(t) E [(Xj(s) - Xj(t))2]

> 0 we

and Yj(s, t) := 0 otherwise. We further define a matrix  and a random vector Z by

 := E Y (ti(n), t(in-1))Y (ti(n)) , Z(ti(n), t(in-1)) := Y (ti(n), ti(n-1)) - Y (ti(n)).

We observe that |jk|  1 and hence in the operator norm   d. The random vectors Z(ti(n), t(in-1)) and Y (t(in)) are independent because the covariance matrix is the zero matrix. By the definition of Y (t(in)) we see that Z(ti(n), t(in-1)) and X(ti(n)) are independent, too. We want to bound P(A(in)\A(in-1)). If t(in) = ti(n-1) then P(Ai(n)\Ai(n-1)) = 0 holds. Thus we may assume that (t(in), t(in-1)) > 0. (9) is bounded by

Each component of Z(ti(n), t(in-1)) is a weighted sum of at most d+1 standard normal random variables with weights in [-1, 1]. Hence the variance of each

Theorem 1. Let X be an (N, d)-Gaussian random field that satisfies Conditions 1 and 2. If Q < d, then for each L  0 there is a constant C > 0 such that all Borel sets F  Rd and all random fields Y which are independent of X and whose sample functions are all in Lip(L) satisfy

P (s  I : X(s) + Y (s)  F )  CHd-Q(F ).

(10)

Proof. By Fubini's theorem it suffices to show for all functions f  Lip(L) P (s  I : X(s) + f (s)  F )  CHd-Q(F ).

We choose some constant  > Hd-Q(F ). By definition of the Hausdorff measure there is a set of balls {B(xl, rl) : l = 0, 1, 2, . . . } such that


F  B(xl, rl) and
l=0

l=0

(11)

For all j we cut the bounded index set I orthogonal to the j-axis with distance (rl/N )1/Hj between the cuts. Each piece of I can be covered by a
single ball of radius rl in the metric . Hence there is a constant c8 > 0 such that I can be covered by at most c8rl-Q balls. We apply Lemma 1 to these balls. By summing up we obtain

P (s  I : X(s) + f (s)  B(xl, rl))  c9rld-Q.

(12)

By (11) and (12) we have

P (s  I : X(s) + f (s)  F )

 P (s  I : X(s) + f (s)  B(xl, rl))  c10.
l=0
We have P (s  I : X(s) + f (s)  F )  c10Hd-Q(F ), since  > Hd-Q(F ) was chosen arbitrarily.

3 Application
In this section we apply our results to nonparametric statistics. Observations in the Gaussian white noise model lead to a Gaussian process to which then Theorem 1 is applied. We conclude that a certain estimator is almost surely well-defined. Existing results on Gaussian random fields have too restrictive assumptions for the application considered here.
The common approach to the estimation of L´evy processes is to take advantage of the L´evy-Khintchine representation. This often involves taking a complex logarithm of the empirical characteristic function, see e.g. [1]

7

and [3]. The branch of the logarithm needs to be taken such that the logcharacteristic function is continuous. This is referred to as the distinguished logarithm. To this end the empirical characteristic function has to be distinct from zero everywhere which means that zero needs to be a polar set. For instance in the set-up of [1] the following function is estimated:
R C :  , v  1 log (1 + iv(1 + iv)FO(v)) , T
Rwhere T > 0, O is some L1( ) function modeling option prices and F de-
notes the Fourier transform. The argument of the logarithm is distinct from
Rzero for all v  and the logarithm is taken such that  is continuous with
(0) = 0. The function O(x) is dominated by an exponentially decaying function for |x|  . Especially xO(x) is integrable. To simplify matters we suppose that O is continuously observed as in the Gaussian white noise
Rmodel, cf. [1]. For  L2( ) we observe RdO~(x) = O(x)dx + (x) dW (x) for all x  .

Taking the Fourier transform yields


F (dO~)(v) = F O(v) + eivx (x) dW (x).
-

Thus the canonical estimator for  is

~(v) := 1 log 1 + iv(1 + iv)F(dO~)(v) T

Rfor all v  .

In [1] a trimmed log-function is used to bound the real part. But this is of no importance for the question whether the estimator ~ is well-defined. We
require the following condition on .

Condition 3. There is a p > 1 such that

 -

(1

+

|x|)p

(x)2dx

<

.

RFor example, if  L2( ) and (x) = O(|x|-p) for |x|   with

p > 1, then the condition is satisfied. Condition 3 and Lemma 4 in the

Appendix imply the uniform modulus of continuity (2) for a version of

X(v) :=

 -

eivx

(x) dW (x).

We will assume that X is a version that

satisfies (2). Thus in the definition of ~ the argument of the logarithm is

almost surely continuous.

RLemma 2. Let fulfill Condition 3. Let O  L1( ) such that xO(x) is
integrable. Then the estimator ~ is almost surely well-defined.

Proof. We have to show that almost surely the argument of the logarithm does not hit zero. The process 1 + iv(1 + iv)F(dO~)(v) equals 1 at v = 0. It
Rsuffices to consider the process on \{0}. We rewrite the process as

iv(1 + iv)

1



+ FO(v) +

eivx (x) dW (x) .

iv(1 + iv)

-

8

We define

f (v) :=

1



+ FO(v) and X(v) :=

eivx (x) dW (x).

iv(1 + iv)

-

On a bounded index set X is an (1,2)-Gaussian random field. We will apply

Theorem 1 to X, Y = f and F = {0}. It is proved in the Appendix that
Runder Condition 3 there is a constant c > 0 such that for all u, v  the

inequality

E[ X(u) - X(v) 2]  c|u - v|min(p/2,1).

(13)

holds. This gives reason to the definition (u, v) := |u - v|H with H = min(p/2, 1)  ]1/2, 1]. Thus Condition 1 is satisfied and we have d - Q = 2 - 1/H > 0.
It remains to show that Condition 2 is fulfilled and that f is Lipschitz
Rcontinuous with respect to the metric . For = 0  L2( ) we have ~ = 
and thus ~ is well-defined. We will now show that the covariance matrix of
RX(v) is not degenerated if = 0  L2(R) and v = 0. Let e  2 such that Re12 + e22 = 1. Then there is   [0, 2] such that e1 = sin  and e2 = cos .
Consider X as a 2-valued stochastic process. The It^o isometry yields

E[(e1X1(v) + e2X2(v))2] = E

2
(e1 cos(vx) + e2 sin(vx)) (x) dW (x)
-


= (e1 cos(vx) + e2 sin(vx))2 (x)2 dx
-

= (sin( + vx))2 (x)2 dx > 0.

-

The function
RR × [0, 2]  , (v, )  (sin( + vx))2 (x)2dx -

is continuous by dominated convergence. On ([-V, -1/V ][1/V, V ])×[0, 2]
it takes a minimum V > 0 for V > 0. Hence Condition 2 is fulfilled on the index set IV = [-V, -1/V ]  [1/V, V ].
RSince xO(x) is integrable we have that FO is Lipschitz continuous on .
1/(iv(1+iv)) is Lipschitz continuous on sets bounded away from zero. Hence
f is Lipschitz continuous on IV . Since IV is bounded it follows that f is Lipschitz continuous with respect to the metric  on IV .
Thus we may apply Theorem 1 to the index set IV = [-V, -1/V ]  [1/V, V ]. Since Hd-Q({0}) = 0 we obtain P (v  IV : X(v) + f (v) = 0) = 0. Because V > 0 was chosen arbitrarily the Lemma follows.

Proof. We define the Gaussian random field Y = {Y (t, s)|t, (t + s)  I} by Y (t, s) := X(t + s) - X(t). By Condition 1 we have

d((t, s), (t , s )) := E[ Y (t, s) - Y (t , s ) 2]  c1 min((0, s) + (0, s ), (s, s ) + (t, t )).

Let  ]0, 1/4[. We denote by D the diameter of T := {(t, s)  I ×
RB(0, )|t + s  I}, where B(0, ) := {s  N |(s, 0)  }. By the first
argument of the minimum D  2c1 holds. For   ]0, [ denote by Nd(T , )

the covering number of T in the metric d, i.e. the minimum number of d-

balls with radius  that are needed to cover T . By the second argument of

the minimum the previous estimates

covering number satisfies Nd(T , we obtain with the substitution
