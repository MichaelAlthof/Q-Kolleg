Monetary Policy, Trend Ination and Ination Persistence

First Draft: Feb.14, 2011
Abstract This paper presents a new mechanism through which monetary policy rules a¤ect ination persistence. When assuming that price reset hazard functions are not constant, backwardlooking dynamics emerge in the NKPC. This new mechanism makes the traditional demand channel of monetary transmission have a long-lasting e¤ect on ination dynamics. The Calvo model fails to convey this insight, because its constant hazard function leads those important backward-looking dynamics to be canceled out. I ...rst analytically show how it works in a simple setup, and then solve a log-linearized model numerically around positive trend ination. With realistic calibration of trend ination and the monetary policy rule, the model can account for the pattern of changes in ination persistence observed in the post-wwii U.S. data. In addition, with increasing hazard functions, the "Taylor principle" is su¢ cient to guarantee the determinate equilibrium even under extremely high trend ination.

1 Introduction
The current policy debate on using monetary easing to spur the U.S. economy out of the Great Recession raises a question on how stable are the ination dynamics to warrant exceptionally easing monetary policy for an extended period. Theoretically, it is closely related to the question whether there exists a structural relationship between current ination and its lags. If the answer is yes, monetary policy can be used to "...ne-tune" the real economy, without having to worry about price stability at least in the short run.
This paper investigates the issue with primary emphasis on how the systematic part of monetary policy rules may a¤ect ination persistence. My analysis is based on the assumption that price reset hazard functions are history-dependent, as opposed to the common Calvo price setting. This assumption is consistent with recent empirical evidence using micro-level data (See e.g. Campbell and Eden, 2005, Alvarez, 2007 and Nakamura and Steinsson, 2008). I show analytically that, when the hazard function is non-constant with respect to the time-sincelast-adjustment, there emerges a lagged-expectation channel in the generalized New Keynesian Phillips curve (GNKPC hereafter), through which the monetary policy parameter a¤ects "intrinsic ination persistence"(Fuhrer, 2006), and hence the backward-looking dynamics of ination is not a structural relationship, in the sense of the Lucas (1976)'s critique.
In the standard New Keynesian monetary models, developed by Rotemberg and Woodford (1997) and Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (2000) among others, ination is not persistent, and monetary policy, typically modeled as nominal interest rate reaction rules, has no bearing on generating ination persistence. This prediction is, however, clearly against the broad consensus drawn from SVAR evidence that monetary policy shocks lead to a delayed and long-lasting responses of ination (Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans, 1999). The theoretical response to this challenge is the hybrid NKPC, introducing some ad hoc forms of backward-looking dynamics in ination (See e.g. Gali and Gertler, 1999 and Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans, 2005). According to this kind of hybrid NKPCs, even though the monetary policy shock generates persistent ination dynamics, there is still no role played by the systematic part of monetary policy rules in generating ination persistence, because the backward-looking dynamics in those models are invariant in monetary policy rules. Recent empirical studies1 explicitly consider the role of shifts in monetary policy rules in accounting for changes in ination persistence. They ...nd that the more aggressive monetary policy regime is closely related to the decline in ination persistence after the Volcker disination.
Analysis in this paper is based on a generic sticky price model set forth by Wolman (1999).2 The model assumes that ...rms adjust their prices following a hazard function, which speci...es probabilities of price adjustment conditional on the time elapsed since the price was last set. As a result, the GNKPC incorporates new dynamic components, such as lags of ination and lagged expectations. Presenting a lagged-expectation channel makes the tradition demand channel of monetary transmission more "powerful" in the sense that monetary policy has now a "longlasting" e¤ect on ination dynamics. In the macro literature, the demand channel of monetary transmission is well understood, but its e¤ect on ination persistence is largely unexplored, because the predominant Calvo price setting implies that only forward-looking expectations

matter for ination dynamics. By contrast, non-constant hazard pricing model gives lagged expectations a role in forming ination dynamics, so that the demand channel of monetary policy can also a¤ect ination persistence.
Using a simple ination-responding Taylor rule, I show analytically that the intertemporal dependence between current ination and its lags is a function of the interest rate responding parameter to ination deviations and price reset hazard rates. When, for example, the ination response parameter conforms to the "Taylor principle" and the price reset hazard function is increasing, the GNKPC exhibits a positive backward dependence. These conditions, however, are su¢ cient but not necessary for having intrinsic ination persistence. In addition, the magnitude of this intertemporal dependence is positively dependent on the strength of the interest rate response to ination deviations, implying that "intrinsic ination dynamics" are only stable when monetary policy does not accommodate ination.
In the numerical experiments, I solve and simulate the equilibrium dynamics of ination using a full-edged DSGE model featuring positive trend ination and increasing price reset hazard functions. I ...nd that, ...rstly, serial correlation of the ination gap rises signi...cantly with trend ination. Secondly, how aggressively monetary policy rules react to ination deviations has also quantitatively important impact on ination persistence. Under the active monetary policy regime, autocorrelation coe¢ cients are smaller at all levels of trend ination than those under a passive monetary regime. These ...ndings are consistent with the empirical evidence that shifts in monetary policy regimes in the early 80's accounted for the decline in ination persistence in the U.S. Together with my analytical result, I identify a new sourse of bene...t associated with the active monetary policy regime in ...ghting ination. When a central bank aggressively responds to ination deviations, on the one hand, overall ination persistence will decline, on the other hand, the intrinsic component of ination persistence will rise. As a result, ination persistence shifts from inherited persistence to intrinsic persistence, making intrinsic ination dynamics more stable and less a¤ected by the extrinsic forces.
Another striking result from the simulation exercise is that, when assuming an increasing price reset hazard function, the "Taylor principle" is su¢ cient to guarantee the determinate equilibrium even under extremely high trend ination. For standard calibration values, the model is determinate even under trend ination of 40% at the annual rate, which is much higher than the values reported in the literature under either Calvo or Taylor staggered price setting.3 The key mechanism at work is that the Calvo staggered price model gives rise to a large price dispersion, and the existence of trend ination aggravates it even further. By contrast, increasing hazard functions restrict the price dispersion, and therefore help to resolve the determinacy puzzle. In the sensitivity analysis, the results discussed above are robust to a wide range of increasing hazard functions.
In the literature, many studies are closely related to this paper. Sheedy (2007) studies the generalized NKPC under a recursive formulation of the hazard function and shows that the dependence of current and lagged ination is a function of the slope of the hazard function. In particular, increasing hazard functions result in positive backward-dependence of ination dynamics. According to my analytical result, the increasing hazard function is only a su¢ cient

but not necessary condition for having intrinsic ination persistence. When monetary policy is comply with the "Taylor principle", intrinsic ination persistence can be warranted even by constant or slightly decreasing hazard function. Empirical studies by Davig and Doh (2008), Benati and Surico (2008) and Benati (2009) raise similar doubts on models building intrinsic ination persistence as a structural feature of the NKPC. For example, Benati estimates a structural backward-looking model under di¤erent monetary regimes, and ...nds that the backward-looking coe¢ cients are not invariant across monetary policy regimes. In theory, alternative explanations for why monetary policy should a¤ect intrinsic ination persistence are provided by various authors. Cogley and Sbordone (2008) show that, when allowing for time-drifting trend ination, the generalized NKPC also embeds a structural persistence term which is a¤ected by trend ination, which stems from monetary policy. Carlstrom, Fuerst, and Paustian (2009) emphasize the impact of monetary policy on the relative importance of di¤erent shocks. In particular, a more aggressive monetary policy rule will increase the relative importance of mark-up shocks relative to demand shocks.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: in section 2, I present the model with the generalized time-dependent pricing and derive the New Keynesian Phillips curve; section 3 shows new insights gained from relaxing the constant hazard function underlying the Calvo assumption; in section 4, I simulate the full-edged DSGE model with positive trend ination and alternative monetary policy regimes; section 5 contains some concluding remarks.

2 The Model
In this section, I construct a New Keynesian monetary model with general price reset hazard functions. Staggered price setting in the model allows for a general form of hazard functions introduced by Wolman (1999).

2.1 Household:

The representative household has one unit of labor endowment in all periods. She works Nt, consumes Ct, buys one-period bonds Bt+1 in period t, and holds at the end of the period with a quantity of money Mt. He maximizes the expected value of discounted future utilities with the following period utility function:

Ut = Et

where Yt is time t production of the ...nal good, Yjt is the quantity of intermediate good j used in the production, and is a parameter strictly greater than one, interpreted as the elasticity

producer yields the demand for each intermediate good

There is a continuum of monopolistically competitive ...rms indexed on the unit interval by j 2 [0; 1]. To produce intermediate goods Yjt; they use a Cobb-Douglas technology:

Yjt = ZtLjt;

(11)

where Ljt is the amount of labor input demanded by the ...rm j in time t, and Zt is an aggregate technology shock.
I assume that intermediate ...rms demand labor input on an economy-wide competitive labor market. Furthermore, because of the monopolistic power, ...rms can choose optimal prices for their goods to maximize real pro...ts:

2.2.1 Pricing Decisions under Generalized Hazard Functions
As in Wolman (1999), I assume that the probabilities for monopolistically competitive ...rms to reset their prices depend on the duration of the price. This is summarized by a hazard function hi, where i 2 f0; Ig denotes the period-since-last-adjustment. I is the maximum number of periods for which a ...rm's price can be ...xed. Table (1) summarizes key notations regarding the dynamics of vintages.

It turns out that, as long as the hazard rates lie between zero and one, there always exists an invariant distribution of price vintages , obtained by solving t(i) = t+1(i): The invariant price-duration distribution (i) is obtained as follows:

(i) = Si , for i = 0; 1;

(15)

In a given period when a ...rm is allowed to reoptimize its price, the optimal price chosen

should reect the possibility that it will not be re-adjusted in the near future. Consequently,

adjusting ...rms choose optimal prices that maximize the discounted sum of real pro...ts over the

time horizon during which the new price is expected to be ...xed. The probability that a new

price will be at least ...xed for i periods is given by the survival function Si, de...ned in Table (1).

4 Note that this equation is only valid under zero steady state ination. See detailed discussion in Ascari (2004).

where the average level of nominal marginal cost of all resetting ...rms is given by M Ct = WtZt 1: The optimal price is equal to the markup multiplied by a weighted sum of future marginal costs, where weights depend on the survival function. In the Calvo case, where Si = i, this equation reduces to the Calvo optimal pricing condition.
Finally, given the invariant price distribution (i), the aggregate price can be written as a

2.3 Generalized New Keynesian Phillips Curve
To study implications of general hazard functions on ination dynamics, I log-linearize the equations around the zero-ination steady state5 and derive the generalized New Keynesian Phillips curve (GNKPC hereafter) under an arbitrary hazard function as follows:6

The GNKPC di¤ers from the standard NKPC in two aspects. First, the GNKPC involves not only forward-looking terms, but also backward-looking dynamics, such as lagged ination and lagged expectations. In addition, all coe¢ cients in the GNKPC are nonlinear functions of price reset hazard rates ( i = 1 hi) and the model's structural parameters. Thereby, short-run dynamics of the ination gap are a¤ected by both the shape and magnitude of hazard functions. Note that the standard NKPC emerges as a special case when assuming the hazard function to be constant over the in...nite horizon. In this case, the distribution of price duration becomes (i) = (1 ) i, and the survival function collapses to i.
The economic intuition why backward-looking dynamics should emerge in the GNKPC, but are missing in the Calvo model, is the following: ...rst, the forward-looking terms enter the Phillips curve through their inuence on the current reset price. As same as in the Calvo sticky price model, the price setting in this model is forward-looking. The optimal price decision is based on the sum of current and future real marginal costs over the time span in which reset prices are ...xed. Second, due to price stickiness, some fraction of past reset prices continue to a¤ect the current aggregate price. Lagged expectational terms represent inuences of past reset prices on current ination. Last, past inations enter the GNKPC, because they a¤ect the lagged aggregate price pt 1: The higher the past inations prevail, the higher the lagged aggregate price would be, and thereby it deters current ination to be high. The two backward looking dynamic terms have opposing e¤ects on ination through pt and pt 1 respectively, and the magnitudes of these counteracting e¤ects depend on the price reset hazard function. In the general case, they should be di¤erent to each other, therefore emerge in the GNKPC, but, in the Calvo case, the constant hazard function causes lagged expectations and lagged ination to be canceled out. This insight is also to be seen in the derivation of the Calvo NKPC:

pt = (1 = (1 = (1
pt = (1

X1 ) j pt j
j=0
) pt + pt 1 + 2pt 2 + )pt + |(1 ) pt 1 {+z 2pt 2 +
= pt 1
)pt + pt 1:

}

The crucial substitution in line (3) is only possible, if the distribution of price durations takes the power function under the Calvo assumption, so that all dynamic e¤ects of past reset prices are replaced by pt 1:

3 Analysis
3.1 Monetary Policy and Intrinsic Ination Persistence
The purely forward-looking NKPC is often criticized for generating too little ination persistence (See e.g. Fuhrer and Moore, 1995). In response to this challenge, the hybrid NKPC has been developed to capture the positive dependence of ination on its lags (See:e.g. Gali and Gertler, 1999 and Christiano et al., 2005). According to this strand of literature, the dependency between current and lagged ination is mechanically modeled as a ...xed primitive relationship, which is

8

independent of changes in monetary policy. By contrast, as analyzed above, the generalized sticky price model propagates ination persistence in a more delicate way. Unlike the hybrid NKPC, ination persistence in this framework is the result of two counteracting channels. The ...rst channel gives lagged ination a direct role, which works through the past aggregate price. I call it the "front-loading channel" because it weakens ination persistence, and its magnitude is purely determined by the price reset hazard function. By contrast, the second channel is an indirect one, where lagged ination a¤ects current ination only through the expectational terms in the GNKPC, I name it the "expectation channel". In this channel, lagged inations have positive coe¢ cients when lagged inations are positively correlated to other variables. Because, in the general equilibrium, the expectation formulation is determined by the whole setup of the model, the magnitude of the "expectation channel" is not only a¤ected by hazard functions, but also by aggregate demand side of the economy and monetary policy.
To show these channels more explicitly, I assume that monetary policy follows a simple Taylor rule it = ^t, where nominal interest rate is set to respond to the deviation of ination from its steady state, and is a non-negative responding parameter to ination deviations. Combining with the log-linearized equation (4) and the goods market equilibrium, it yields

Et [y^t+1] y^t = it Et [^t+1] :

(19)

Substituting the Taylor rule into equation (19), it yields

Et [^t+1] = ^t Et [y^t+1] + y^t: Iterating this equation forward, we get higher-order expectations

(20)

Et [^t+2] = Et [^t+2] =

Et [^t+1] Et [y^t+2] + Et [y^t+1]

2 ^t Et [y^t+2] + (1

) Et [y^t+1] + y^t:

(21)

For analytical simplicity, I use a simple version of the GNKPC with a maximum price duration of J = 3 periods. I also assume = 1; then the GNKPC can be expressed as follows

1 ^t = Et (( 1 + 1 2) ^t+1 + 1 2 ^t+2 + !y^t + 1!y^t+1 + 1 2!y^t+2)

+ 1 Et 1 (( 1 + 1 2) ^t + 1 2 ^t+1 + !y^t 1 + 1!y^t + 1 2!y^t+1)

+ 1 2 Et 2 (( 1 + 1 2) ^t 1 + 1 2 ^t + !y^t 2 + 1!y^t 1 + 1 2!y^t)

2)

Ination persistence in this equilibrium Phillips curve is driven by both intrinsic and extrinsic sources. AR(y^t) represents a complex autoregressive process of the extrinsic driving force, while the "intrinsic" ination dynamic is driven by the lags of ination and ination expectations ( 1Et [^t+1] + 2Et [^t+2] + 3 ^t 1 + 4 ^t 2). It is worthy to note that the backward-looking part ( 3 ^t 1 + 4 ^t 2) is totally absent in the standard Calvo NKPC, while, in the hybrid NKPC, its coe¢ cients are invariant to monetary policy. By contrast, intrinsic persistent coef...cients ( 3; 4) in the GNKPC are functions of policy parameter , as well as hazard rates
1; 2: In the following propositions, I formally show how those parameters a¤ect intrinsic ination persistence in the GNKPC.

Proposition 1 : The GNKPC (23) exhibits positive intrinsic persistent coe¢ cients

I consider, namely > 0 and 0 < 1; 2 < 1. and inequality (24) holds, when 1 2 (

2 12

2 +( 1

2) > 0:

1) +

To draw some instructive economic intuitions from the condition (26), I study inequality by

parts. First, when 1 > 0, it implies that monetary policy conforms to the "Taylor principle",

i.e. monetary policy should react strongly to ination deviations by adjusting nominal interest

rate more than one for one. The "Taylor principle" is one of the most important guidelines for

the practice of modern monetary policy. In addition, it is also the necessary condition for a

DSGE model with the Taylor rule to have a determinate equilibrium. I view, therefore, that this condition is ful...lled under a normal circumstance. Given > 1, 2 2 > 0 holds too.

Besides the monetary policy parameter, the shape of hazard functions is also an important

factor in determining intrinsic ination persistence in the condition (26). Sheedy (2007) studies

the generalized NKPC under a recursive formulation of the hazard function and concludes that

10

increasing hazard functions give rise to intrinsic ination persistence. According to the condition (26), his conclusion is only a su¢ cient, but not necessary condition for generating intrinsic ination persistence. The increasing hazard function implies 1 > 2. This condition together with the "Taylor principle" will guarantee that the condition (26) is satis...ed ( 1 2 > 0), but it is not necessary condition, because Equation (24) requires the sum to be greater than zero, but not by parts.

Proposition 2 : The intrinsic persistent coe¢ cients are increasing in ination response parameter :

Proof :

@3 =

1+ 1 2+2 1 2

>0

@ (1 + 2) (1 + 1 + 1 2)

@4 =

2 1 2 (1 + 2) > 0;

@ (1 + 2) (1 + 1 + 1 2)

(27) (28)

This result has important implications for monetary policy. First of all, since the coe¢ cient on lagged ination depends on the parameter in the monetary policy rule, the "intrinsic ination persistence" in the reduced-form Phillips curve is not a structural relationship in the sense of the Lucas critique (Lucas, 1976). Secondly, the monetary policy stance can strengthen or weaken the "intrinsic anchor" of ination dynamics through the traditional demand channel of monetary transmission. When monetary policy reacts aggressively to ination deviations, implying that the real interest rate will always rise to counter whatever reasons that cause increase in ination. In this circumstance, agents in the economy will form expectations betting that ination will not deviate by a large amount from its past values, so that, at the aggregate level, ination dynamics are well anchored on its own history. This belief is stronger, when monetary policy is more aggressive on ination deviations. E¤ects of expectation channel on ination is well understood in macroeconomics, but what is new in the model is that the demand channel of monetary transmission has a long-lasting e¤ect on ination through the presence of lagged expectations in the GNKPC, so that monetary policy a¤ects not only the current ination, but also ination persistence in the future.
Furthermore, one can see that monetary policy parameter even a¤ects intrinsic ination persistence in an accelerating way, as the second derivatives with respect to are also positive.

4 Monetary Policy, Trend Ination and Ination Persistence A Numerical Assessment
To study the equilibrium dynamics of ination, I solve and simulate the log-linearized DSGE model around non-zero steady state ination. Recent monetary economic literature emphasizes the role played by positive trend ination on ination persistence. Seminal work by Cogley and Sbordone (2008) show that, when allowing for time-drifting trend ination, the generalized NKPC also embeds a structural persistence term which is a¤ected by the drifting trend ination, which results from monetary policy. More importantly, many authors also ...nd that positive trend ination requires stronger responses by the central bank to achieve stabilization

in a determinate equilibrium than under zero trend ination. For example Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2008) show that the Taylor principle breaks down when trend ination exceeds 1.2% per year. With trend ination around 7 percent per year, the response to ination deviation needed to guarantee the determinacy is 10 times higher than that with zero trend ination. Motivated by these results, I log-linearized the equilibrium equations around non-zero steady state ination. As seen in the following log-linearized equations, trend ination ( ) a¤ects ination dynamics in a very complex manner. In the next section, I conduct a numerical assessment by solving this log-linearized DSGE model

All real variables (y^t; n^t; c^t; mccrt ) are expressed in terms of log deviations from the non-stochastic steady state. Prices (p^t; p^0t; p^t ) are ...rst detrended and log-linearized around the common trend. The ination gap ^t is the deviation of ination from its constant trend and it denotes the net rate of nominal interest.

4.1 Calibration

In the calibration, I parameterize the hazard function in a parsimonious way. In particular, the

functional form I apply is the hazard function of the Weibull distribution with two parameters:7

8 < h(j) = :

j

1
, when h(j) < 1

1 , when h(j) > 1

(29)

7 I exclude hazard rate greater than one, because, in my theoretical setup, ...rms are not allowed to adjust their prices more than once per period.

is the scale parameter, which controls the average duration of price adjustment, while is the shape parameter to determine the monotonic property of the hazard function. The shape parameter enables the incorporation of a wide range of hazard functions by using various values. In fact, any value of the shape parameter that is greater than one corresponds to an increasing hazard function, while values ranging between zero and one lead to a decreasing hazard function. By setting the shape parameter to one, we can retrieve a Poisson process. In ...gure (1), I plot the Weibull distributions and corresponding hazard functions with di¤erent values of the shape parameter.
I choose = 3 based on empirical evidence from micro-level data. It implies an average price duration of three quarters, which is largely consistent with the median price durations of 7 - 9 months documented by Nakamura and Steinsson (2008). The shape parameter is allowed to vary in the interval between one and three, which covers a wide range of increasing hazard functions.8 As for the rest of the structural parameters, I follow values commonly used in the literature. I assume = 0:99, which implies a steady state real return on ...nancial assets of about four percent per annum. I choose the steady state market labor share N = 1=3: The elasticity of substitution between intermediate goods = 10, which implies the desired markup over marginal cost should be about 11%. Finally, I set the standard deviation of the shock to the Taylor rule to be 1%.
4.2 Simulation Results
In the numerical experiments, I study how the serial correlation in ination reacts to the monetary policy rule and trend ination. Since this DSGE model is only driven by a transitory shock to the Taylor rule, it is not intended to capture the realistic level of ination persistence in the data, instead, the focus is the pattern of changes in ination persistence.
8 Microeconometric studies typically ...nd that aggregate hazard function is downward sloping, however, my rationale for focusing only on increasing hazard functions is two-fold: ...rst, increasing hazard functions are theoretically consistent with the micro-founded state-dependent pricing models (Dotsey et al., 1999). In addition, Alvarez et al. (2005) show that decreasing hazards could simply result from the aggregation mechanism over individual hazard functions with di¤erent durations.

Table 2: Second moments of the simulated data (tau=2)

In table (2), I report the ...rst-order autocorrelation coe¢ cient of the ination gap under di¤erent values of the gross quarterly rate of trend ination and the response parameter to ination deviations in the Taylor rule . In this simulation exercise, I use the shape parameter of = 2 in the Weibull distribution.
The ...rst noteworthy result from the table is that ination persistence increases with trend ination, but decreases in the ination response parameter. Under two monetary policy regimes, serial correlation of the ination gap rises signi...cantly with trend ination. This ...nding is consistent with empirical evidence,9 showing that various measures of ination persistence declined signi...cantly since early 80's, which coincides with the drop of average ination level during the same period. In addition, the monetary policy regime has also a quantitatively important impact on ination persistence. Under the active monetary policy regime ( = 1:5), autocorrelation coe¢ cients are smaller at all levels of trend ination than those under a passive monetary regime ( = 1:01). This result is also consistent with empirical evidence, see e.g. Davig and Doh (2008) and Benati and Surico (2008), that shifts in monetary policy regimes in the early 80's accounted for changes in ination persistence in the U.S. data. Along with my analytical result in Proposition 2, we can conclude an additional bene...t of active monetary policy in ...ghting ination. When a central bank aggressively adjusts the nominal interest rate in response to the ination deviation, on the one hand, overall ination persistence will decline, on the other hand, the intrinsic component of ination persistence will rise. As a result, ination persistence shifts from inherited persistence to intrinsic persistence, making ination dynamics more stable and less a¤ected by the extrinsic forces. Put into another words, when the central bank is "hawkish", ination is more ...rmly anchored on its own past.
The second striking result from this simulation exercise is that, when the price reset hazard function is increasing, the Taylor principle is su¢ cient to guarantee a determinate equilibrium even when facing extremely high trend ination. Under my baseline calibration, the model is determinate even under trend ination as high as annual rate of 40% ( = 1:1), which is much higher than values reported in the literature under either Calvo or Taylor staggered price setting.10 For example, with standard calibration of Calvo sticky price models, Ascari and Ropele (2009) report that for levels of trend ination greater than the annual rate of 2.42%, the simple Taylor principle breaks down. It seems, however, that the Taylor (1980) staggered price model is more robust to positive trend ination. Kiley (2007) and Hornstein and Wolman (2005) study this case, and ...nd that equilibrium determinacy is more di¢ cult to achieve through reasonable speci...cations of the Taylor rules at levels around 4 percent per year. The key mechanism at

work is that the Calvo staggered price model gives rise to a large price dispersion and existence of trend ination aggravates the price dispersion even further. The Taylor staggered pricing model, however, limits it by setting a maximum price duration, which reins the price dispersion. In addition, the Taylor model also implies a special form of increasing hazard function, which takes values of either zero during the price contract and one at the end of the price contract. This indicates that changing the shape of hazard functions from the constant one in the Calvo model to a more general form is the key to resolve this determinacy puzzle. In the following, I conduct a robustness check of results discussed above by simulating the GNKPC model under some alternative shapes of hazard functions.

Table (3) reports the same measure of ination persistence using the shape parameter of = 3, indicating a more increasing hazard function. The results repeat the pattern from the table (2), except that the ination gap is more persistent under each pair of ( ; ). This is consistent with the analytical result of Proposition 1, predicting that, ceteris paribus, intrinsic ination persistence, and hence the overall level of ination persistence, will rise, when the hazard function is more increasing.

Table 4: Second moments of the simulated data (tau=1.3)

In Table (4), I report the simulation result with a mild increasing hazard function ( = 1:3), which is closer to that in the Calvo model. In this case, I get very little ination persistence, which reminds us of the famous critique on the standard Calvo sticky price model for generating too little ination persistence (See: e.g. Fuhrer and Moore, 1995). Moreover, when the hazard function becomes atter, the Taylor rule ceases to warrant for determinacy under a high trend ination. One can show that, when attening the hazard function further, indeterminacy will occur under lower and lower levels of trend ination.

4.3 Empirical Relevance of the Model
In this section, I show that the GNKPC model can account for the pattern of changes in ination persistence in the U.S. post-WWII monetary history. New consensus emerges in monetary economics, that monetary policy regime, trend ination and ination persistence are closely related phenomena. Empirical work, e.g. Cogley, Primiceri, and Sargent (2010) and Fuhrer

15

(2009) among others, documents a "low-high-low" pattern of changes in ination persistence since the 60's in the U.S. This change is argued to be closely related to the shift in monetary policy regime in the early 80's during Volcker disination.11 To see if the GNKPC model can capture this historical "low-high-low" pattern of ination persistence, I calibrate the model using realistic settings of trend ination and the Taylor rule parameter in four sub-periods in the U.S. post-WWII monetary history.

Table 5: Second moments of the simulated data (tau=1.3)

In Table (5), I simulate the course of ination persistence under the reference values taken from the study by Cogley, Primiceri, and Sargent (2010). I consider four sub-periods. First, the 60's were a period with both low trend ination and an active monetary regime. I choose trend ination to be 2% at the annual rate during this period and = 1:5. Second, the 70's were characterized by high trend ination and passive monetary policy (Clarida, Gali, and Gertler, 2000). I set trend ination to be 7%, which is consistent with most estimates in the literature. The Taylor rule parameter is set to be a little bit above one to reect weak responses of monetary policy to ination deviations and guarantee determinacy. Third, the early 80's were marked as a transitional time from high ination to a low ination regime. I use a relative high value of the ination response parameter in the Taylor rule ( = 2) to mirror the period of Volcker disination. Finally, the 90's were well known as a period of "Great Moderation" and the U.S. monetary policy under chairman Greenspan was conducted complying with the "Taylor Principle". Using these values, I simulate the model with an increasing hazard function ( = 3) : The ...nal row of the table shows, that the simulated ination persistence is well in line with the reference values observed in the data. Ination persistence was low during the 60's, rose during the 70's, and dropped under Volcker disination and ...nally settled on 0.3 during the 90's. With only i.i.d. monetary policy shocks, my simulations reect quite well this "low-high-low" pattern, despite that it fails to generate the high magnitude of ination persistence in the 70's. This result suggests that the inner propagation mechanism of the GNKPC model is capable to capture, to a large extent, the complex interactions among monetary policy rule, trend ination and ination persistence in the data.

5 Conclusion
In this paper, I present a model in which the monetary policy rule a¤ects ination persistence. The key assumption on which the analysis are based is that price reset hazard functions are history-dependent. When probability of price resetting depends on the duration of prices, lagged expectations of ination emerge in the generalized NKPC. As a result, policy-induced interest rate changes have a long-lasting e¤ect on ination dynamics.
The implications of this model for the current policy debate are as follows: ...rst, the reducedform positive dependence of ination and its lags is not the "structural" relationship, upon which monetary policy operates. In the model, the magnitude of the intertemporal dependence is positively dependent on the strength of the interest rate response to ination deviations. Thus, intertemporal ination dynamics are only stable when monetary policy does not accommodate ination. Second, this model reveals a new source of bene...t associated with the active monetary policy in ...ghting ination. When a central bank aggressively responds to ination deviations, ination persistence shifts from inherited persistence to intrinsic persistence, making ination more stably anchored on its own history, so that it is less a¤ected by the extrinsic driving forces. On the other hand, when the central bank holds an easing policy stance on ination, they would face a capricious ination dynamic even in the short run.
