Sticky Information and Determinacy
Alexander Meyer-Gohde
Abstract The infinite-dimensional sticky-information Phillips curve is cast as a finite-dimensional timevarying system of difference equations in order to directly assess determinacy in the model with demand given by the forward-looking IS equation and monetary policy by an interest rate rule. An equivalence to the model without lagged expectations holds (albeit tenuously) for the particular specification and a common truncation method produces spurious determinacy.

1 Introduction
The sticky-information model of Mankiw and Reis (2002),1 with an infinite regress of lagged expectations, cannot be brought into the canonical form of Blanchard and Kahn (1980) to assess determinacy (existence of a unique, bounded equilibrium). I analytically derive the determinacy properties for a standard New Keynesian model with sticky information by recasting the system as a time-varying system of difference equations. I show that for standard dynamic IS demand and the interest rate rule examined here, the parameter restriction to ensure determinacy is the same as would be obtained by examining the model without lagged expectations. Such an equivalence need not hold in general, however, as the non-singularity constraints and finite variational bounds satisfied by the particular model analyzed here need not be satisfied by other models with lagged expectations. With analytical results in hand, I conclude by demonstrating that a standard truncation method produces spurious determinacy.

2 A Sticky-Information Model

A basic sticky-information New Keynesian model can be written as2

(1) yt = Et [yt+1] - a1Rt + a1Et [t+1]

(2)

t

=

1

- 



yt


+ (1 - ) iEt-i-1 [t
i=0

+  (yt

- yt-1)]

where yt is the output gap, t inflation , and Rt the nominal interest rate. Equation (1) is a dynamic

IS-curve and (2) is Mankiw and Reis's (2002) sticky-information Phillips curve. Here, a1 and  are assumed positive,3 and 0 < 1 -  < 1 is a firm's probability of receiving an information

update.

Monetary policy will be described by the following rule for the interest rate to close the

model

(3) Rt = RRt-1 +  [(1 - ) Et [t+1] + t ] + yyt

where 0  R < 1 describes the degree of interest-rate smoothing, 0   <  of inflation targeting, and 0  y <  of output-gap targeting. The coefficient 0    1 nests contemporaneous inflation targeting ( = 1) and inflation forecast targeting ( = 0) into the rule.

3 Endogenous Fluctuations and Determinacy

Without loss of generality, I abstract from exogenous driving forces.4 By examining the infi-
nite moving average representation of the model in response to endogenous fluctuations (i.e.,
to sunspot shocks), the system of difference equations originating from the model of sticky in-
formation will yield a non-autonomous or time-varying system of homogenous non-stochastic
difference equations.
Consider a sunspot shock that occurs at time 0 and denote with xt the response of the variable
x in period t to the sunspot. The response of the model, defined by (1), (2), and (3), is given by
2See, e.g., Trabandt (2007) for a first-principles derivation analogous to Woodford (2003, Ch. 4). 3See, e.g., Woodford (2003, pp. 160≠164 & 243≠245) 4With bounded exogenous driving forces, the boundedness of the particular solution will rest on that of the homogenous solution. See Taylor (1986), Woodford (2003, pp. 252, & 636) and Pituk (2002).

the system of deterministic time-varying difference equations

(4) yt = yt+1 - a1Rt + a1t+1 (5) t+1t = 1 - t+1 yt -  1 - t yt-1

(6) Rt = RRtR-1 +  [(1 - ) t+1 + t ] + yyt

with R-1 = 0, where (4) and (6) correspond straightforwardly to (1) and (3), and where (5) follows from (2) after noting that both the response of variables and expectations dated before 0 are zero.5

Equation (5) gives the time-varying difference equation described by the sticky-information

Phillips curve (2). As t  , the foregoing converges to the "unrestricted" perfect-foresight

version of the model, given by yt = yt-1 as all outdated information sets are updated. The

lagged expectations serve to transition the Phillips curve from having a positive trade-off at time

0, given by 0 = (1 - ))y0, to being vertical with no trade-off in the limit. This contrasts with the sticky-price Phillips curve, which always posits the same dynamic trade-off between inflation and output: t - t+1 = yt under perfect foresight.6 Although the model itself is time

invariant, the response of a variable under sticky information is time varying: the equilibrium

relationships between the responses of endogenous variables to a shock change as the shock

becomes more outdated. The model will be determinate (sunspots can be ruled out), if the only

sequence of impulse responses to a sunspot shock that remains bounded is the trivial sequence of

zeros for all variables at all horizons; i.e., if the only bounded response of endogenous variables

to sunspots is no response at all.

Lagging (5) forward and noting the additional initial condition yields the following system

 t+2

- 1 - t+2

(7)  a1 - (1 - )

1 0

0  t+1 0 -  1 - t+1

-a1 yt+1  = 

0

1 Rt



0   t  1 0   yt  y R Rt-1

for i = 0, 1, 2, ..., with R-1 = 0 and 0 = (1 - ) y0.

The foregoing system has two initial conditions but three variables. As the system is ho-

mogenous, one solution is t, yt, Rt = 0, t = 0, 1, ..., but it may not be the only bounded solu-

tion. Different potential solutions can be indexed by different values for the "missing" initial

condition--i.e., a value for y0 or 0; if the system (7) is stable, then it will remain bounded for

any such finite initial condition and, thus, the sunspots cannot be ruled out. If the system, however, has a one-dimensional unstable manifold that can be associated with this condition, then the boundedness requirement will provide the missing initial condition and sunspots can be ruled out.

Noting (9) and following Ludyk's (1985) Theorem 3-29, the system in (8) is stable if C is

stable and, from Ludyk's (1985) Theorem 3-12, will remain bounded for any bounded initial

conditions.

conditions. In this case, the boundedness condition will be insufficient to pin down the missing

initial condition and one cannot rule out sunspot equilibria (i.e., the model is indeterminate).

Should |z3| > 1, then z3 is a simple dominant eigenvalue. Noting (9) and following Pituk's
(2002) Theorem 1, solutions of (8) are related asymptotically to solutions of the system xt+1 = Cxt via limt z3-t t yt Rt-1  = , where  is a constant and  is the eigenvector of C corresponding to z3. The eigenvector is 1 0 1  and as |z3| > 1, t and Rt will be unbounded

striction that rules out the sunspot equilibria (i.e., the model is determinate).

4 Equivalence and Specious Determinacy

It is conspicuous that the parameter bound for determinacy is independent of the parameters outside of the interest rate rule. This independence is related to the equivalence of the determinacy bounds to those in a frictionless version of the model. To see this, note that in the absence of lagged expectations, (5) reduces to yt = yt-1, which is necessarily stable. Thus, determinacy of the system without lagged expectations can be ascertained by means of the following system

Rt = Et [t+1]

Rt = RRtR-1 +  [(1 - ) Et [t+1] + t ]

Following

Blanchard

and

Kahn

(1980),

|

R+ 1- (1- )

is

required

for

determinacy.

This

is,

of

course, the same bound as in (3.1). This equivalence is, however, more tenuous than one might

infer from Wang and Wen (2006). As can be seen in the proof of (3.1), both singular coefficient

matrices and infinite variation--if (9) does not hold--can cause this equivalence to break down:

neither of which can be a priori ruled out. Generally,8 the sticky-information model needs to be truncated when a particular solution is

sought. The truncation used by Trabandt (2007) and Andre¥s, Lo¥pez-Salido, and Nelson (2005),

which eliminates the tail of the distribution of lagged expectations, leads to a specious determi-

nacy region for an otherwise indeterminate monetary policy rule.

I-1
+ (1 - ) iEt-i-1 [t
i=0

+  (yt

- yt-1)]

To simplify the calculations, consider pure inflation forecast targeting by the monetary au-

thority: the special case of  = R = y = 0 in (3). The system can now be written in matrix

form as
I II
  0 = AiEt-i [Yt+1] + BiEt-i [Yt ] + CiEt-i [Yt-1] i=0 i=0 i=0
where Yt = t yt Rt . This is the canonical form of Meyer-Gohde (2010) and determinacy

can be ascertained by examining the eigenvalues () of the matrix pencil9

Ii=0 Ci 0

Ii=0 Bi I

0 I

- Ii=0 Ai 0

the determinate of which yields

I+1 -  - I+1 a1 ( - 1) -  I+1 - 1 - I+1 a1 ( - 1) 3 = 0

The two "missing" eigenvalues are called "infinite." Of the remaining four eigenvalues, it is

trivial to see that three are equal to zero. Thus, determinacy will rest upon the final eigenvalue



=

I+1 - I+1 -

 - I+1 a1 ( - 1) (1 - I+1) a1 ( - 1)

being outside the unit circle. This holds if

<

(1

2I+1 +  - 2I+1)

This requires the interest-rate rule to satisfy the Taylor Principle and to not react "too strongly"

to expected inflation. Proposition 3.1, with  = R = y = 0, states that the true, non-truncated

model is necessarily indeterminate. As the tail of the distribution of lagged expectations never

adjust, the truncation scheme causes the long-run Phillips curve to become non-vertical like in

the standard sticky-price model and leads to the emergence of a specious determinacy region.
9The lagged expectations also have to be resolvable--i.e., Meyer-Gohde's (2010) Equation (12) has to be invertible. This held with the non-truncated model and thus follows here as both models are identical up to the truncation.
