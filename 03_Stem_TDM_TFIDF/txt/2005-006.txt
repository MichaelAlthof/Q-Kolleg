Abstract. We extend the definition of a convex risk measure to a conditional framework where additional information is available. We characterize these risk measures through the associated acceptance sets and prove a representation result in terms of conditional expectations. As an example we consider the class of conditional entropic risk measures. A new regularity property of conditional risk measures is defined and discussed. Finally we introduce the concept of a dynamic convex risk measure as a family of successive conditional convex risk measures and characterize those satisfying some natural time consistency properties.

1 Introduction
In recent years a growing attention has been devoted to an axiomatic treatment of the quantification of financial risks. Artzner et al. proposed in their seminal work [1] a set of desirable axioms that every risk measure should satisfy, defining in such a way the class of coherent risk measures. Delbaen [4] proved that, under a mild continuity assumption, every coherent risk measure can be represented as worst expected loss with respect to a given set of probabilistic models. F¨ollmer and Schied [8] and Frittelli and Rosazza Gianin [9] introduced independently the more general class of convex risk measures weakening the axioms of positive homogeneity and subadditivity by replacing them with convexity. They also extended Delbaen's representation result allowing for the occurrence of a penalty

function defined on a set of probabilistic models. A common feature of all these approaches is the static temporal setting, i.e. the risk measures do not accommodate for intermediate payoffs or additional information. These two issues have been addressed simultaneously in T.Wang [15], Riedel [11] and Weber [16]. We concentrate on the information aspect and investigate on a general probability space conditional risk measures.
This paper aims at giving a possible axiomatic foundation to the risk assessment of final payoffs when additional information is available. This is the case, for example, when the riskiness of a payoff occurring at time T is quantified at an intermediate date t  (0, T ). We define conditional convex risk measures as maps, satisfying some natural axioms, which associate to every payoff, represented by a random variable X, its riskiness (X) which is itself a random variable, depending on the available information. Furthermore, under a mild technical assumption, we give a characterization of these maps as worst conditional expected loss with respect to a given set of probabilistic models, maybe corrected by some random penalty function. A new regularity property is introduced and several equivalent formulations are presented; this property, which is economically plain, states that (X) should not depend on that part of the future which is ruled out by the additional information. As an example for conditional convex risk measures, the class of entropic risk measures, as defined in [7], is generalized to the conditional setting. These risk measures are first defined as capital requirements with respect to an utility-based acceptability criterion. Then their penalty functions are identified as the conditional relative entropy between the considered probabilistic models and a reference model. The last part of the paper is devoted to a study of dynamic convex risk measures, i.e. families of conditional convex risk measures, describing the risk assessment of a final payoff at successive dates. We introduce two economically motivated properties of time consistency that relate different components of a dynamic convex risk measure. Finally, we provide some characterizations of these properties in terms of the family of penalty functions of their components.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we define conditional convex risk measures by generalizing the translation invariance and convexity axioms. We also provide a characterization of these risk measures as conditional capital requirements with respect to suitable acceptance sets. In Section 3 we show that, under a continuity assumption, every conditional convex risk measure can be represented as worst conditional expected loss with a random penalty function defined on a set of probabilistic models. Section 4 contains a discussion of a regularity property which is shared by every conditional convex risk measure. In Section 6 the class of conditional entropic risk measures is introduced as an example for conditional convex risk measures. Section 6 is devoted to dynamic convex risk measures and contains a discussion of natural time consistency properties. Finally, the Appendix collects definitions and some useful results about extended valued random variables and essential suprema.

2 Conditional convex risk measures
We denote with L0, resp. L, the space of random variables, resp. bounded random variables, defined on some fixed probability space (, F, P ). A good feature of these spaces is their invariance with respect to the probability measure, provided it is chosen in the equivalence class of P . Let G  F be a sub--algebra and define the two subspaces
L0G {X  L0 | X is G-measurable}, LG L  L0G .
Finally, we define the following two sets of probability measures:
P {Q probability measure on (, F) | Q P on F}
PG {Q  P | Q  P on G}.
The probability measures in P can be interpreted as probabilistic models. An element X  L describes a random net payoff to be delivered to an agent at a fixed future date. The -algebra G collects the information available to the agent who is assessing the riskiness of the payoff X. As a consequence the risk measurement of X leads to a random variable (X) which is measurable with respect to G, i.e. an element of the space LG0 . We are thus studying maps of the type  : L  LG0 , to be called conditional risk measures. Plainly, we interpret (X)() as the degree of riskiness of X when the state  prevails.

Remark 2.1 The -algebra G can be interpreted in different ways. It can model

additional information available at date t = 0 to the agent. Alternatively, it can

be interpreted as information available at a future date t > 0, resulting from the

observation of some variables related to the payoff X in the time interval [0, t].

In both cases, the sources of information can be public, i.e. shared by all agents,

or private. Hence, conditional risk measures open a way to the analysis of the

consequences of asymmetric information for risk measurement.



Consider the following three properties to be shared by a conditional risk measure :

· (Conditional) Translation Invariance For any X  L and Z  LG:

(X + Z) = (X) - Z

· Monotonicity. For any X, Y  L: X  Y  (X)  (Y )

· (Conditional) Convexity. For any X, Y  L and   LG with 0    1:
(X + (1 - )Y )  (X) + (1 - )(Y ).

3

Definition 2.2 A map  : L  LG is called a conditional convex risk measure if it is translation invariant, monotone, convex and satisfies (0) = 0.
If we have no initial information, i.e. G is the trivial -algebra, then the definition of a conditional convex risk measure coincides with the unconditional one.

Remark 2.3 Some economic considerations to be discussed in Section 4 suggest

to assume that (0) is a constant random variable. The choice (0) = 0 has no

particular economic relevance, but it allows mathematical simplification as it

implies () = - for every   R. However, from the mathematical viewpoint,

the assumption (0)  LG is sufficient to ensure the validity of the following

results.



Remark 2.4 We do not loose any generality by assuming that the values of a conditional convex risk measure are bounded. Indeed, if X  L, then
-||X||  X  ||X||, so that

- < -||X|| = (||X||)  (X)  (-||X||) = ||X|| < +

and as a consequence (X)  LG .



The economic rationale behind the properties characterizing conditional convex risk measures is the same as in the unconditional case (see [1], [8], [9]). In particular, translation invariance provides the interpretation of a convex risk measure  as (conditional) capital requirement. Indeed, it is easy to show that the conditional risk measure  is translation invariant if and only if

(X) = ess.inf {Y  LG | X + Y  A},

(1)

where

A {X  LG | (X)  0}

is called the acceptance set of . The following proposition states some important relations between conditional risk measures and acceptance sets. We refer to the Appendix for the definition and some properties of the essential infimum.

Proposition 2.5 If  is a conditional convex risk measure, then its acceptance set A is:
a. conditionally convex, i.e. A + (1 - )A  A for every   LG with 0    1,
b. solid, i.e. X  Y  A  X  A, c. such that ess.inf A = 0 and 0  A.
Conversely, if a set A  L satisfies the previous properties, then the map
A(X) ess.inf {Y  LG | X + Y  A}, X  L,
is a conditional convex risk measure.

4

Proof. The properties of acceptance sets follow directly from the definition of conditional risk measures. Concerning the second claim, it is straightforward to verify that A satisfies translation invariance, monotonicity and the normalization property A(0) = 0; it follows in particular that A takes values in LG . We show that A is conditionally convex. Suppose that X, Y  L and that ZX , ZY  LG are such that ZX +X  A and ZY +Y  A. For   LG with 0    1, the conditional convexity of A implies (ZX + X) + (1 - )(ZY + Y )  A. Hence, by the translation invariance of A,
0  A((ZX + X) + (1 - )(ZY + Y ))
= A(X + (1 - )Y ) - (ZX + (1 - )ZY )
and the conditional convexity of A follows.

3 A robust representation result

In the unconditional case, we remind that every convex risk measure  : L  R which is continuous in a mild sense, admits the representation:

(X) = sup {-EQX - (Q)}, X  L,
QP

(2)

in terms of a so called penalty function  : P  [0, +]; see [6] or [9] for a proof.
We prove below that a similar characterization holds as well for conditional con-
vex risk measures which are continuous in a sense to be specified. In this more
general representation formula, the expectations are conditional on the available information G, the penalty function is random-valued and the supremum is un-
derstood in the essential sense. Moreover, in the conditional case the additional
information allows to exclude a-priori some probabilistic models. In fact, we show that only the models in PG  P may enter the representation. This fact can be interpreted in economic terms as caution: the smaller the information G, the larger is the subset PG of probabilistic models which can be considered in the worst case representation. For ease of presentation we give the following definition where LG0 (R+) {X  L0(R) | X is G-measurable, X  0} (see the Appendix).

Definition 3.1 A map  : L  LG is said to be representable if
(X) = ess.sup {-EQ(X | G) - (Q)}, X  L
QPG

(3)

for a map  : PG  LG0 (R+). In this case,  is called a (random) penalty function for .

It is immediate to check that any representable map with a penalty function  satisfying
ess.inf (Q) = 0
QPG

5

is a conditional convex risk measure. Under a mild continuity condition the converse holds as well as the following theorem shows.

Theorem 3.2 Let  : L  LG be a conditional convex risk measure. Then the following are equivalent:

a.  is continuous from above, i.e. Xn P -a.s.;
b.  is representable;
c.  is representable in terms of

X P -a.s. implies (Xn)

(X )

(Q) ess.sup {-EQ(X | G) - (X)}, Q  PG.
X L

Proof. c = b This implication follows immediately. b = a. Suppose that  is representable with a penalty function  and that Xn X P -a.s. By monotone convergence we have that

-EQ(Xn | G) - (Q) -EQ(X | G) - (Q)

for every Q  PG. Hence, the robust representation yields

(X )

=

ess.sup
QPG

{nlim[-EQ(Xn

|

G)

-

(Q)]}



lim inf
n

ess.sup
QPG

{-EQ(Xn

|

G)

-

(Q)}

=

lim inf
n

(Xn).

On the other hand, the monotonicity of  implies lim infn (Xn)  (X). a = c. The inequality

(X)  ess.sup {-EQ(X | G) - (Q)}
QPG
easily follows from the definition of . Indeed, for every Q  PG and X  L it holds (X)  -EQ(X | G) - (Q) and thus the inequality is recovered taking the supremum over all Q  PG. Hence, in order to prove the representability of  it suffices to show that

EP [(X)]  EP [ess.sup {-EQ(X | G) - (Q)}].
QPG

To this end, consider the map 0 : L  R defined by 0(X) EP [(X)], X  L. It is simple to check that 0 is a (unconditional) convex risk measure; furthermore, if Xn X P -a.s., then (Xn) (X) P -a.s. and, by monotone convergence
0(Xn) = EP [(Xn)] EP [(X)] = 0(X),

6

so that 0 is continuous from above. Hence, Theorem 4.26 in [8] implies that 0 has the following representation:
0(X) = sup {-EQX - 0(Q)},
QP
where 0(Q) sup {-EQX - 0(X)}.
X L
We now prove that if 0(Q) < +, then Q  PG. To this end, note that if X  LG, then by translation invariance of  we have 0(X) = EP [(X)] = -EP X. Suppose now that Q(A) = P (A) for some A  G, then
0(Q)  sup{-EQ(IA) - 0(IA)}
R
= sup{-Q(A) + P (A)} = +.
R
Since EQX = EQ[EQ(X | G)] = EP [EQ(X | G)] for every Q  PG, it follows that
0(X) = sup {-EP [EQ(X | G)] - 0(Q)}.
QPG
Next we prove that EP [(Q)] = 0(Q) for every Q  PG. We claim that for every Q  PG the set BQ {-EQ(X | G) - (X) | X  L} is upward directed (see the Appendix). In fact, if X, Y  L we can define Z XIA + Y IAc  L, where A {-EQ(X | G) - (X)  -EQ(Y | G) - (Y )}  G. Since both IA and IAc are G-measurable, 0  IA  1 and IAc = 1 - IA, the conditional convexity of  yields:
(Z) = (XIA + Y IAc )  IA(X) + IAc (Y ).
As a consequence
-EQ(Z |G) - (Z) = = - EQ(XIA + Y IAc | G) - (XIA + Y IAc ) [-EQ(X | G) - (X)]IA + [-EQ(Y | G) - (Y )]IAc  max(-EQ(X | G) - (X), -EQ(Y | G) - (Y )),
thanks to the definition of A, and therefore BQ is upward directed. Then it follows by Lemma A.2, for any Q  PG,
EP [(Q)] = EP [ess.sup {-EQ(X | G) - (X)}]
X L
= sup {-EP EQ(X | G) - EP [(X)]}
X L
= sup {-EQX - 0(X)} = 0(Q).
X L
Hence, we get
EP [(X)] = 0(X) = sup {-EP [EQ(X | G)] - EP [(Q)]}
QPG
 EP [ess.sup {-EQ(X | G) - (Q)}],
QPG
7

and the proof is complete.

Remark 3.3 Analogue to the unconditional case, the penalty function  in the
preceding theorem is the minimal penalty function which may enter a robust representation for , i.e.    for all penalty functions  for . The following
useful equality holds

(Q) = ess.sup {-EQ(X | G)}, Q  PG,
X A

as in the unconditional case.



The following lemma will be useful in Section 6.

Lemma 3.4 If  is the minimal penalty function of a representable conditional risk measure  and H  G is a sub--algebra, then

EP ((X) | H) = ess.sup {-EQ(X | H) - EP ((Q) | H)}, X  L.
QPG

Proof. First we prove that the set

CX {-EQ(X | G) - (Q) | Q  PG}

is upward directed. Indeed, for any Q , Q  PG define the probability measure Q on F by
Q(B) Q (A  B) + Q (Ac  B), B  F ,
where

A {-EQ (X | G) - (Q )  -EQ (X | G) - (Q )}  G.

It is immediate to observe that Q  PG and that EQ(X | G) = IAEQ (X | G) + IAc EQ (X | G) for any X  L. By applying Lemma A.3 we obtain

(Q) = ess.sup {-EQ(XIA | G) - IA(X)} + ess.sup {-EQ(XIAc | G) - IAc (X)}

X L

X L

= ess.sup {-IAEQ (X | G) - IA(X)} + ess.sup {-IAc EQ (X | G) - IAc (X)}

X L

X L

= IA(Q ) + IAc (Q ).

As a consequence

-EQ(X | G) - (Q) = = IA(-EQ (X | G) - (Q )) + IAc (-EQ (X | G) - (Q ))  max(-EQ (X | G) - (Q ), -EQ (X | G) - (Q )),

8

by definition of A. Hence, the set CX is upward directed. Then Lemma A.2 in its conditional form yields
EP ((X) | H) = ess.sup {EP (-EQ(X | G) - (Q) | H)}
QPG
= ess.sup {-EQ(X | H) - EP ((Q) | H)},
QPG
as we desired.

Remark 3.5 Note that the restriction to PG in the choice of the probabilistic

models gives sense to expressions like ess.sup {-EQ(X | G) | Q  Q}. Indeed, if Q  PG, then LG0 (P ) = L0G(Q); therefore EQ(X | G)  LG0 (P ) for every Q and the supremum is well-defined. In the proof of the previous theorem, we also

made use of the natural equality EP [EQ(X | G)] = EP X, which holds if and

only if Q  PG. Moreover, it is important to observe that if Q and P are not even equivalent on G, then it may happen that EQ(X | G) / L0(P ) and in that

case the expectation of X with respect to P is meaningless.



Remark 3.6 A conditional coherent risk measure can be defined as a conditional convex risk measure that is positively homogeneous, i.e. (X) = (X) for any X  L and any   LG with   0. As in the unconditional case, it can easily be shown that the minimal penalty function of a representable conditional coherent risk measure  vanishes on the convex set
Q {Q  PG | EQ(X | G)  -(X) X  L}
and takes otherwise the value +. Therefore it can be represented as

(X) = ess.sup {-EQ(X | G)}.
Q Q

Conversely, any map with such a representation is a conditional coherent risk

measure.



Example 3.7 For a parameter   LG with 0 <  < 1 we consider the set of

probabilistic models

-1}.

The corresponding conditional coherent risk measure

AVaR(X) ess.sup {-EQ(X | G)}, X  L
QQ

is called Average Value at Risk at level . It generalizes the unconditional risk

measure AVaR (see e.g. Definition 4.36 in [8]).



For an example of a conditional convex risk measure which is not coherent we refer to the entropic risk measures to be introduced in Section 5.

4 A regularity property

In a sense, the additional information available to the agent has to be fully used when assessing the riskiness of a payoff X. This means, in particular, that if we know that an event A  G is prevailing, then the riskiness of X should depend only on what is really possible to happen, i.e. on the restriction of X to A. This simple requirement is captured by the following property.
Definition 4.1 A conditional risk measure  : L  LG is said to be regular if for every A  G and X, Y  L
XIA = Y IA = (X)IA = (Y )IA
Some equivalent definitions of regularity are stated in the next proposition.

Proposition 4.2 The following are equivalent for a conditional risk measure :

a.  is regular;

b. (XIA) = (X)IA for every A  G and X  L;

c. (XIA + Y IAc ) = (X)IA + (Y )IAc for every A  G and X, Y  L;

d. (

N n=1

XnIAn )

=

N n=1

(Xn

)IAn

for

pairwise

disjoint

An

 G,

Xn



L

and N  1.

Proof. a. = b. Since XIA = (XIA)IA and 0IAc = (XIA)IAc , by regularity we have (X)IA = (XIA)IA and 0 = (0)IAc = (XIA)IAc . Summing up we obtain
(XIA) = (XIA)IA + (XIA)IAc = (X)IA.
b. = c. We have

(XIA + Y IAc ) = (XIA + Y IAc )IA + (XIA + Y IAc )IAc = ((XIA + Y IAc )IA) + ((XIA + Y IAc )IAc ) = (XIA) + (Y IAc ) = (X)IA + (Y )IAc .
c. = d. The proof is an induction on N . When N = 1 just take Y = 0 in c. Suppose for induction that c. holds for every index less or equal to N . If (An)nN=+11 is a family of pairwise disjoint events in G, define B nN=1An  G. Using c. we obtain

N +1

N

= ( XnIAn )IB + (XN+1IAN+1 )IBc

d. = a. From d. follows b. directly. If XIA = Y IA then b. implies (X)IA = (XIA) = (Y IA) = (Y )IA and therefore  is regular.

In the unconditional case, regularity holds trivially for any map  : L 
LG = R. When G is not trivial, then this is not true in general. For example, the simple map (X) EP X, X  L is not regular if G is not trivial.

Proposition 4.3 Every conditional convex risk measure is regular.

Proof. From the conditional convexity of A follows directly

IAA + IAc A = A

(4)

for all A  G. Then for X, Y  L and A  G, we have

(IAX + IAc Y ) = ess.inf {Z  LG | IAX + IAc Y + Z  A} = ess.inf LG  (A - IAX - IAc Y ) = ess.inf LG  (IA(A - X) + IAc (A - Y )) ,

where the third equality follows from (4). It is immediate to see that if A, A  L and A  G, then LG  (IAA + IAc A ) = IA(LG  A) + IAc (LG  A ). Hence, we obtain

(IAX + IAc Y ) = ess.inf IA(LG  (A - X)) + IAc (LG  (A - Y )) = IA ess.inf LG  (A - X) + IAc ess.inf LG  (A - Y ) = IA(X) + IAc (Y ),

where we applied Lemma A.3 in the second equality. We conclude by applying Proposition 4.2.

Remark 4.4 Regularity of a conditional risk measure implies in particular the following natural property: if a final payoff X is constant on an event A  G, that is XIA = IA P -a.s. for a constant   R, then (X) should be constant as well on that event. Indeed, if XIA = IA P -a.s. for   R and A  G, then according to Proposition 4.2 regularity implies:

(X)IA = (XIA) = (IA) = ()IA = -IA,

so that  is constant on A as well.



5 The class of conditional entropic risk measures
In the unconditional case, the notion of entropic risk measure has been introduced in [8] (see example 4.60). In the definition of this class of risk measures, it

11

is assumed that an agent has an exponential utility u(x) = 1 - exp(-x), with  > 0 as risk aversion coefficient. His acceptance set is then naturally defined to
be A {X  L | EP u(X)  EP u(0) = 0},

which is solid and convex; the resulting convex risk measure (X) inf{m  R | X + m  A} is called the entropic risk measure associated with the risk

aversion . It has been proved (see [8]) that the risk measure  is continuous

from above and that its minimal penalty function in the robust representation

is

0(Q)

1 H(Q|P ), 

where

H(Q|P )

EP

dQ dQ log
dP dP

is the relative entropy of Q with respect to P .

Remark 5.1 If we replace in the previous construction the exponential utility

with another, increasing and concave but otherwise general, utility u we obtain

the larger class of utility-based convex risk measures. An interesting issue is

the comparison between the initial preference structure, X Y  EP u(X)  EP u(Y ), and the derived one, X Y  u(X)  u(Y ), where u is the risk measure induced by u. In [10] the entropic risk measures have been characterized

as the only ones - apart from those induced by linear utilities - for which and

coincide.



We now pass to the conditional case in which a sub--algebra G  F is fixed.
We assume, as before, that the agent is characterized by the exponential utility u(x) = 1 - exp(-x) for a risk aversion  > 0. The (random) expected utility of the agent conditional on the information G is therefore

U (X) EP (1 - e-X | G) = 1 - EP (e-X | G)  L0G.

Consider, as in the unconditional case, the acceptance set

A {X  L | U(X)  U(0) = 0} = {X  L | EP (e-X | G)  1}.

It satisfies the conditions in Proposition 2.5 and thus leads to a conditional convex risk measure  that has the explicit representation

(X) ess.inf {Y  LG | X + Y  A}

= ess.inf {Y  LG | EP (e-X | G)  eY }

=

1 

log

EP (e-X

|

G).

Definition 5.2 The conditional convex risk measure  defined above is called the conditional entropic risk measure associated with the risk aversion  > 0.

12

The name entropic derives, as in the unconditional case, from the form of the penalty function in the robust representation. Therefore, we extend the notion of relative entropy to the conditional setting.

Definition 5.3 For every Q  PG the conditional relative entropy of Q w.r.t.

P is

on G.

Interpreting Q

and P as regular conditional probabilities the conditional relative entropy can

also be introduced pointwise as (unconditional) relative entropy. This approach

coincides with definition 5.3 for Q  PG.

With this notion of conditional relative entropy, we can represent the minimal

penalty function of entropic risk measures.

Proposition 5.4 For any  > 0,  is representable and its minimal penalty

function is

(Q)

=

1 

HG

(Q|P

),

Q  PG

Proof. Using monotone convergence it is straightforward to prove continuity from above. According to Theorem 3.2,  is thus representable. The form of the minimal penalty function can be derived as

Q  PG.

Finally, Lemma 5.5 proves the claimed representation of the minimal penalty function.

Lemma 5.5 For any Q  PG it holds ess.sup {EQ(Z | G) - log EP (eZ | G)} = HG(Q | P ).
Z L

13

Proof. "". For any fixed Z  L, the random variable

Z

eZ EP (eZ | G)

is strictly positive, integrable and EP Z = 1, so that it is the density w.r.t. P of a probability measure P Z  P . Hence, we have Q P Z and

Z - log EP (eZ

| G) = log

dQ dP

dQ dP Z

which yields

EQ(Z

| G) - log EP (eZ

| G) = EQ(log

dQ dP

dQ | G) - EQ(log dP Z

Because of P Z  PG applying Jensen's inequality to the convex function g defined by g(x) = x log x for x > 0 and g(0) = 0 yields

dQ dQ

dQ

EQ(log dP Z | G) = EP Z (g( dP Z ) | G)  g(EP Z ( dP Z | G)) = g(1) = 0.

We then conclude

EQ(Z

| G) = HG(Q | P ) - EQ(log

6 Dynamic convex risk measures
In this section we investigate conditional risk measures in a dynamic framework where successive measurements are performed. Consider a finite set of dates 0 = t0 < t1 < . . . < tN = T when the riskiness of a final payoff at time T is assessed. We introduce a filtration (Fn)Nn=0 where Fn models the information available at time tn. Moreover, we assume that F0 is trivial and FT = F .
Definition 6.1 A dynamic convex risk measure is a family (n)nN=0 where every n : L  Ln L(Fn) is a conditional convex risk measure.
Remark 6.2 The risk measurement at time tN = T has been introduced for ease of notation only. Note that the only conditional convex risk measure at time tN is N (X) = -X for all X.
The concept of a dynamic risk measure has first been introduced by T.Wang [15] and then elaborated on by Riedel [11] and Weber [16]. Consistently with our previous discussion, we additionally require that every component is a conditional convex risk measure. Plainly, a dynamic convex risk measure maps a random variable X  L into the adapted process (n(X))nN=0 and can be seen as the result of a risk assessment of a final payoff through time. This definition of a dynamic convex risk measure is quite general: in fact it can be completed by some form of internal time consistency. Consider the following three properties for a dynamic convex risk measure (n)Nn=0:
· Time consistency. For any X, Y  L and 0  n  N - 1 it holds
n+1(X) = n+1(Y ) = n(X) = n(Y )
· Recursiveness. For any X  L and 0  n  N - 1 it holds
n(X) = n(-n+1(X)).
· Supermartingale. For any X  L and 0  n  N - 1 it holds
n(X)  EP (n+1(X) | Fn).
The financial meaning of time consistency is based on a general intuition: if two payoffs will have tomorrow the same riskiness in every state of nature, then the same conclusion should be drawn today as well. The case for recursiveness, on

15

the contrary, strongly relies on the interpretation of a conditional convex risk
measure as a capital requirement. In fact, it requires that the riskiness n(X) of a final payoff X today equals the riskiness of the capital requirement n+1(X) that has to be set aside tomorrow. The property of recursiveness has been
introduced by Roorda et al. [12] and Riedel [11] and it is actually equivalent to time consistency. Indeed, assume that (n)nN=0 is time consistent and fix n; by conditional translation invariance of n+1 we have n+1(-n+1(X)) = n+1(X), so that n(-n+1(X)) = n(X). The converse implication is trivial. Finally, the supermartingale property can be interpreted as follows: as time
evolves, the information about the payoff X increases. This should lower the
perceived riskiness - not almost surely, but in the (conditional) mean.

Remark 6.3 Arztner et al. [2] show in a two period example (see the remark

after Definition 5.5) that the dynamic convex risk measure whose general com-

ponent is a conditional Average Value at Risk with a fixed parameter is not time

consistent.



An example for a dynamic convex risk measure that shares all the three above mentioned properties is given by the dynamic entropic risk measure whose general components are

n (X )

1 

log EP (e-X

|

Fn),

X  L

with risk aversion  > 0.

Proposition 6.4 Every dynamic entropic risk measure is time consistent and satisfies the supermartingale property.

Proof. For any n and X  L we have

n (X )

=

1 

log EP (e-X

|

Fn)

=

1 

1 log EP (exp{-(- 

log EP (e-X

|

Fn+1))}

|

Fn)

= n(-n+1(X)).

The process (n(X))nN=0 is a P -supermartingale since it is a concave function of the P -martingale (EP (e-X | Fn))Nn=0.

We now assume that a dynamic convex risk measure (n)Nn=0 is representable, meaning that every component is representable. In this case, for every n it holds

n(X) = ess.sup {-EQ(X | Fn) - n (Q)}, X  L
QPn

where Pn

{Q  P | Q  P on Fn} and n (Q) ess.sup {-EQ(X | Fn) - n(X)},
X L

Q  Pn.

16

Plainly, Pn+1  Pn for all n and PN = {P }. Our aim is now to relate the dynamic properties of the family (n)nN=0 to some properties of the family of minimal penalty functions (n )nN=0. We begin with a sufficient condition for the supermartingale property.
Proposition 6.5 If EP (n (Q) | Fn-1)  n-1(Q) for any Q  Pn, then (n(X))nN=0 is a P -supermartingale for any X  L.
Proof. We have
EP (n(X) | Fn-1) = ess.sup {-EQ(X | Fn-1) - EP (n (Q) | Fn-1)}
QPn
 ess.sup {-EQ(X | Fn-1) - n-1(Q)} = n-1(X),
QPn-1
where Lemma 3.4 has been applied in the first equality.

From now on, we assume that for any probability measure P on F and
any sub--algebra G  F, a regular conditional probability of P given G exists.
Remind that a regular conditional probability of P given G is a map PG : ×F  [0, 1] such that PG(, ·) is a probability measure for each  and PG(., A) is a version of EP (IA|G) for every A  F. This assumption is satisfied if (, F) is a Polish measurable space or, more generally, if F is countably generated (see
[5] for other sufficient conditions). In what follows, Pn will denote the regular conditional probability of P given Fn.

Definition 6.6 If Q P and G  F is a sub--algebra, then the pasting of P and Q in G is the probability measure P QG defined by P QG(A) EP (QG(·, A)), A  F .
It is not difficult to prove that
EP QG (X|H) = EP [EQ(X|G)|H]
for every sub--algebra H  G.

Proposition 6.7 The family (n)Nn=0 is time consistent if and only if for every n the map

n(Q) EQ(n+1(P Qn+1)|Fn) + ess.inf {n (R) | R  Q on Fn+1}, is a penalty function for n. Proof. For every X  L Lemma 3.4 yields

Q  Pn

n( - n+1(X)) =

= ess.sup {ER(ess.sup {-ES(X | Fn+1) - n+1(S)} | Fn) - n (R)}

RPn

SPn+1

= ess.sup {-ER(ES(X | Fn+1) | Fn) - n (R) - ER(n+1(S) | Fn)}
RPn, SPn+1

= ess.sup {-ERSn+1 (X | Fn) - n(R, S)},
RPn, SPn+1

17

where n(R, S) n (R) + ER(n+1(S) | Fn). Note that {RSn+1 | R  Pn, S  Pn+1} = Pn. The inclusion "" is easy to see. For the converse, observe that a probability measure Q  Pn can be written in the form Q = RSn+1 if and only if Q  R on Fn+1 and Qn+1  Sn+1 (P a.s. as probability measures): these conditions are met by taking R = Q and S = P Qn+1. Hence
n(-n+1(X)) = ess.sup {-EQ(X | Fn) - n(Q)},
QPn
where
n(Q) ess.inf {n(R, S) | R  Pn, S  Pn+1, Q = RSn+1} = ess.inf {n (R) + ER(n+1(S) | Fn) | R  Q on Fn+1, S  Pn+1, Sn+1  Qn+1} = ess.inf {n (R) + ER(n+1(P Qn+1) | Fn) | R  Q on Fn+1}.
Finally, observe that if R  Q on Fn+1, then ER(Y |Fn) = EQ(Y |Fn) for any Y  Ln0+1 for which the expectations exist; consequently
n(Q) = EQ(n+1(P Qn+1) | Fn) + ess.inf {n (R) | R  Q on Fn+1}.
We easily conclude, observing that n(-n+1(X)) = n(X) if and only if n defined above is a penalty function for n.
A dynamic coherent risk measure is defined to be a dynamic convex risk measure whose components are coherent. If it is representable, then for every n we have
n(X) = ess.sup {-EQ(X | Fn)},
QQn
where Qn {Q  Pn | EQ(X | Fn)  -n(X) X  L} is the set where n vanishes. Therefore Proposition 6.5 and Proposition 6.7 can be stated in a simpler way.
Corollary 6.8 Let (n)Nn=0 be a representable dynamic coherent risk measure. 1. It satisfies the supermartingale property provided Qn  Qn-1 for any n. 2. It is time consistent if and only if for any n, n can be represented in terms of
Qn {Q  Pn | P Qn+1  Qn+1 and Q  Qn s.t. Q  Q on Fn+1 }.
Conclusions
We characterize the class of conditional risk measures which can be interpreted as good conditional capital requirements. In particular, under a weak technical assumption which is essentially the same as in the unconditional setting,
18

we provide a representation for these risk measures as worst conditional loss with respect to a set of probabilistic models and a penalty function. The main difference in comparison with the unconditional setting is provided by the random nature of these two objects. This is natural, since they describe, in some sense, the degree of trustworthiness towards different models, which depends on available information and thus may change in time. In the representation we propose, additional information is reflected both in the conditional nature of the expectations and in the penalty function. This issue is particularly important when successive risk measurements of the same payoff are performed or, in our terminology, when a dynamic risk measure has to be constructed. In this case, a penalty process has to be chosen, describing how the degree of trustworthiness of different models evolves through time. In the last section it is shown how this choice is constrained by some basic natural consistency properties. Notwithstanding, in our opinion the class of penalty processes is still too large from an economic viewpoint, so that other consistency properties have to be discussed even in connection with the theory of updating information. Finally, a complete economic interpretation of the penalty term still lacks, even in the classical setting. This interpretation could be related to some sort of preference structure in the dual space, that of probabilistic models. We leave this important issue to further investigation.
A Appendix
Let (, F, P ) be a probability space and denote by L0(R) the space of extended random variables, i.e. P -equivalence classes of F-measurable maps from  to R [-, +], where the natural extension of the Borel -algebra is considered on R. The preorder initially defined on L0 naturally extends to this larger space; we refer to Section II.4 in [14] for other natural conventions. For any subset X  L0(R), the family of dominating random variables D(X ) {Z  L0(R) | Z  X, X  X } is not empty, since it contains +.
Theorem A.1 For any X  L0(R) there exists a unique element X  D(X ) such that X  Z for any Z  D(X ). If in addition X is upward directed, i.e. for any X1, X2  X there exists X  X such that X  max(X1, X2), then there is an increasing sequence (Xn)nN in X such that Xn X P -a.s.
Proof. See [8], Theorem A.18
The random variable X characterized in the previous theorem is called the essential supremum of X and denoted by ess.sup X . The essential infimum is defined by ess.inf X -ess.sup (-X ). The definition of (conditional) expectation is naturally extended to L0(R): see again [14] for details.
Lemma A.2 If X  L0(R) is upward directed then it holds
EP (ess.sup X ) = sup EP X,

The previous result holds as well if expectations are replaced by conditional expectations with respect to some sub--algebra G  F and in the right hand side the essential supremum is considered.

Lemma A.3 If X , Y  L0(R) and A  F , then
ess.sup (X IA + YIAc ) = (ess.sup X )IA + (ess.sup Y)IAc ,
where X IA + YIAc {XIA + Y IAc | X  X , Y  Y}.
Proof. "" This relation is immediate. "" If Z  D(X IA + YIAc ) then consider Z ZIA + (ess.sup X )IAc . Since Z  X for all X  X , then Z  ess.sup X . Hence, we have ZIA = Z IA  (ess.sup X )IA and the claim follows from a similar argument on Ac.
