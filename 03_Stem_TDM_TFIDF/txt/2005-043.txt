On Local Times of Ranked Continuous Semimartingales; Application to Portfolio Generating Functions
Raouf Ghomrasni
June 13th, 2005
We derive the decomposition of the ranked continuous semimartingales i.e. orderstatistics processes. We apply it to portfolios generated by functions of the ranked market weights. Thus we generalize recent results of Fernholz.
Key words and phrases: Portfolio-generating function, continuous semimartingale, local time, ranked processes.

1 Introduction
The distribution of capital, i.e., the family of ranked market weights, starting with the largest weight and going to the smallest, is of central importance in stochastic portfolio theory, as are functionally generated portfolios. Usually we identify stocks by their names, i.e., their subscripts, X1, X2, X3, etc. However, with regards to the distribution of capital, it is advantageous to identify the stocks by their ranks rather than their names. Portfolios generated by functions of the ranked market weights first appeared in Fernholz ([2]). Fernholz derivations require that the processes X1, ∑ ∑ ∑ , Xn be pathwise mutually nondegenerate. Here, we shall extend Fernholz's results in its full generality. The relative return of a functionally generated portfolio satisfies a stochastic differential equation wich depends on the local times associated with the changes in rank among the stocks.
Section 2 of the paper contains the decomposition of the ranked continuous semimartingales i.e. order-statistics processes. As an interesting byproduct, we obtain an extension of Ouknine's formula [5, 6, 7]. In section 3 we use these decompositions to portfolio generated by functions of the ranked market weights. Thus we generalize recent results of Fernholz [2, 3].

2 Decomposition of Ranked Continuous Semimartingales

Definition 2.1 Let X1, ∑ ∑ ∑ , Xn be continuous semimartingales. For 1  k  n, the k-th rank process of X1, ∑ ∑ ∑ , Xn is defined by

X (k)

=

max
i1<∑∑∑<ik

min(Xi1 , ∑ ∑ ∑

, Xik )

where 1  i1 and ik  n.

Note that, according to Definition 2.1, for t  IR+,

max
1in

Xi(t)

=

X (1) (t)



X (2) (t)



∑

∑

∑



X (n) (t)

=

min
1in

Xi(t)

so that at any given time, the values of the rank processes represent the values of the original processes arranged in descending order (i.e. the (reverse) order statistics).
The following proposition shows that the rank processes derived from continuous semimartingales can be expressed in terms of the original processes, adjusted by local times.

Proposition 2.1 Let X1, ∑ ∑ ∑ , Xn be continuous semimartingales. For k  {1, 2, ∑ ∑ ∑ , n}, Let u(k) = (ut(k), t  0) :  ◊ [0, [ {1, 2, ∑ ∑ ∑ , n} be any predictable process with the property:
Xt(k) = Xut(k)(t)
Then the k-th rank processes X(k), k = 1, ∑ ∑ ∑ , n, are continuous semimartingales and we have:

n
X(k)(t) = X(k)(0) +
i=1

t
1{us(k)=i} dXi(s)
0

+

1 2

n i=1

t
1{us(k)=i} ds L0s((X(k) - Xi)+)
0

-

1 2

n i=1

t
1{us(k)=i} ds L0s((X(k) - Xi)-).
0

where L0t (X) is the local time of the continuous semimartingale X at 0.

Proof: We adapt here the proof given by Chitashvili and Mania ([1]) for the decomposition of the maximum of semimartingales (i.e. k = 1), we have,

nt

nt

Xt(k) - X0(k) =

1{us(k)=i} dXsi +

1{us(k)=i} d (Xs(k) - Xsi)

i=1 0

i=1 0

Where we used the property

n i=1

1{us (k)=i}

=

1

it

follows,

nt

nt

nt

Xt(k)-X0(k) =

1{us(k)=i} dXsi +

1{us(k)=i} d (Xs(k)-Xsi)+-

1{us(k)=i} d (Xs(k)-Xsi)-

i=1 0

i=1 0

i=1 0

We note the fact:

{us(k) = i}  {Xs(k) = Xi(s)}

Therefore, using the following formula

1 2

L0t (X)

=

t
1{(Xs=0)} d Xs
0

2

which is valid for non-negative continuous semimartingales X.

We can give a more explicit decomposition as follows:

Corollary 2.1 Let X1, ∑ ∑ ∑ , Xn be continuous semimartingales.Then the k-th rank processes X(k), k = 1, ∑ ∑ ∑ , n, are continuous semimartingales and we have:

n
X(k)(t) = X(k)(0)+
i=1

t 0

1{us (k)=i}

dXi(s)

+

1 2

n
Lt0(X(k)-X(i)) -
i=k+1

1 2

k-1
L0t (X(i)-X(k)).
i=1

where Lt0(X) is the local time of the continuous semimartingale X at 0.

Proof: We fixe i = 1, ∑ ∑ ∑ , n and we deal with

t 0

1{us (k)=i}

ds

L0s ((X (k)

-

Xi)+)

tn
1{us(k)=i} ds Ls0((X(k) - Xi)+) =
0 j=1 n
=
j=1

t
0 1{us(k)=i}{Xi=X(j)} ds Ls0((X(k) - Xi)+)
t
0 1{us(k)=i}{Xi=X(j)} ds L0s((X(k) - X(j))+)

We, conclude by noting:
nt
i=1 0 1{us(k)=i}{Xi=X(j)} ds L0s ((X(k) - X(j))+) = Lt0((X(k) - X(j))+)
Indeed,
t
0 1{us(k)=i}{Xi=X(j)} ds Ls0((X(k) - X(j))+)
t
= 0 1{us(k)=i}{Xi=X(j)} ◊ 1{X(k)-X(j)=0} ds L0s((X(k) - X(j))+)
t
= 0 1{us(k)=i}{Xi=X(k)} ◊ 1{X(k)-X(j)=0} ds L0s ((X(k) - X(j))+)
t
= 1{us(k)=i}ds Ls0((X(k) - X(j))+)
0

In the particular case considered by Fernholz (see [2]) of rank processes derived from pathwise mutually nondegenerate absolutely continuous semimartingales

Corollary 2.2 (Fernholz)
Let X1, ∑ ∑ ∑ , Xn be pathwise mutually nondegenerate absolutely continuous semimartingales, and for t  [0, T ], let pt be the random permutation of {1., n} such that for k = 1, ∑ ∑ ∑ , n,

Xpt(k)(t) = X(k)(t),

and pt(k) < pt(k + 1) if X(k)(t) = X(k+1)(t).

Then the k-th rank processes X(k), k = 1, ∑ ∑ ∑ , n, are continuous semimartingales and we

have:

n
X(k)(t) = X(k)(0) +
i=1

t
1{ps(k)=i} dXi(s)
0

+

1 2

L0t (X

(k)

-

X

(k+1))

-

1 2

L0t (X(k-1) - X(k)).

where L0t (X) is the local time of the continuous semimartingale X at 0.

Now, we state the solution to Problem 4.1.13 stated in Fernholz's book:

Corollary 2.3 Let X1, ∑ ∑ ∑ , Xn be continuous semimartingales.Then the k-th rank processes X(k), k = 1, ∑ ∑ ∑ , n, are continuous semimartingales and we have:

n
X(k)(t) =X(k)(0) +
i=1

t
1{ps(k)=i} dXi(s)

-

1 2

L0t (X(k-2)

-

X (k) )

-

1 2

L0t (X(k-1)

-

X (k) ).

where Lt0(X) is the local time of the continuous semimartingale X at 0.

Theorem 2.1 Let X1, ∑ ∑ ∑ , Xn be continuous semimartingales.Then we have:
nn
Lt0(X(i)) = Lt0(Xi)
i=1 i=1
where Lt0(X) is the local time of the continuous semimartingale X at 0.

Proof: We recall first that Lt0(Z) = Lt0(Z+) for every semimartingale Z. Hence, it is enough
to consider the case where X1, ∑ ∑ ∑ , Xn are non-negatives continuous semimartingales. We
need to check the following equality holds:

nn

1{X(i)=0} dX(i) =

1{Xi=0} dXi

i=1 i=1

From Corollary 2.1, we have

nn

k-1

d X(k) =

1{ut(k)=i} dXi +

1{X(k)-X(i)=0}d (X(k)-X(i)) -

1{X(i)-X(k)=0}d (X(i)-X(k)).

i=1 i=k+1

i=1

It follows:

nn

1{X(k)=0} d X(k) =

1{ut(k)=i} 1{X(k)=0} 1{Xi=X(k)}dXi +

1{X(k)-X(i)=0}1{X(k)=0} d (X(k) - X(i))

i=1 i=k+1

k-1

- 1{X(i)-X(k)=0}1{X(k)=0} d (X(i) - X(k)).

i=1

nn

= 1{ut(k)=i} 1{Xi=0}dXi +

1{X(i)=0}1{X(k)=0} d (X(k) - X(i))

i=1 i=k+1

k-1
- 1{X(i)=0}1{X(k)=0} d (X(i) - X(k)).
i=1

4

Now we may choose our ut(∑) as a bijection on {1, ∑ ∑ ∑ , n}, we denote its inverse by vt(∑)

nn

1{X(k)=0} d X(k) =

1{vt(i)=k} 1{Xi=0}dXi +

1{X(i)=0}1{X(k)=0} d (X(k) - X(i))

i=1 i=k+1

k-1
- 1{X(i)=0}1{X(k)=0} d (X(i) - X(k)).
i=1

By summation over the index k = 1, ∑ ∑ ∑ , n we obtain our result.

In particular,
Corollary 2.4 Ouknine's formula Let X and Y be semimartingales. It is shown that
Lt0(X  Y ) + Lt0(X  Y ) = Lt0(X) + L0t (Y ) where Lt0(X) (t  0) denotes the local time at 0 of X.

3 Portfolio Generating Functions

Theorem 3.1 Let M be a market of stocks X1, ∑ ∑ ∑ , Xn. Let S be a function defined on a neighborhood U of n. Suppose that there exists a positive C2 function S defined on U . Then S generates the portfolio  such that for k = 1, ∑ ∑ ∑ , n,
n
pt(k)(t) = Dk log S(µ(∑)(t)) + 1 - µ(j)(t) Dj log S(µ(∑)(t)) µ(k)(t),
j=1

for all t  [0, T ], a.s., with a drift process  that satisfies

Remark 3.1 The theorem above extend Fernholz's theorem where the assumption for X1, ∑ ∑ ∑ , Xn of pathwise mutually nondegenerate was needed.

Proof : It^o's formula implies that:

n

d log S(µ(∑)(t)) = Di log S(µ(∑)(t))d µ(i)(t)

Since the local time component of the drift process is decreasing, the long-term relative performance of  will suffer if there are many changes of leadership in the market.

Example. (The size effect) The size effect is the observed tendency of small stocks to have higher long-term returns than large stocks. Let 1 < m < n and suppose

SL(x) = x(1) + ∑ ∑ ∑ + x(m).

Then the drift d is given by:

dt

:=

-

1 2

m k=1

µ(k) SL

n
d
i=m+1

Lt0(log

µ(k)

-

log

µ(i))

If we specify, the Fernholz's case, we obtain:

dt

:=

-

1 2

µ(m) SL

d L0t (log

µ(m)

-

log

µ(m+1))

Similarly,

SS (x) = x(m+1) + ∑ ∑ ∑ + x(n).

Then the drift d is given by:

dt

:=

+

1 2

n k=m+1

µ(k) SL

m-1 i=1

d Lt0(log

µ(i)

-

log

µ(k))

Since the drift process is monotonically increasing, it is likely that the return on smallstock index will eventually be greater than that of the large-stock index. Hence, the higher long-term return of small-stock index is due to the increasing drift process, and the relative level of small-stock risk is irrelevant.
