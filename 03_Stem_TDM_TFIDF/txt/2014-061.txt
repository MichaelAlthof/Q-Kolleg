The statutory breakdown of payroll taxes between rms and workers and the business
cycle
Simon Voigts
February 24, 2016
Abstract
According to conventional wisdom, the statutory split of payroll taxes between rms and workers is irrelevant for the real allocation in the long run, as tax incidence is fully determined by the market structure when prices and wages adjust. This paper breaks with this view, by showing that if payroll taxes are levied on workers, business cycle uctuations of prices and wages are smaller than under the formal taxation of rms. Lower nominal volatility mitigates price and wage dispersion, and thereby the proclivity loss from business cycles. In a standard DSGE model calibrated to a typical European country, a full shift of contributions from rms to workers reduces the welfare costs of the business cycle 11.25%.

1 Introduction
It is well known that in a market setting with exible prices, the breakdown of the burden of a transaction tax between buyer and seller is fully determined by the price elasticties of demand and supply. This insight, which goes back at least to Dalton (1922), is known as liability side equivalence or tax incidence equivalence and is a standard principle of public nance (see Stiglitz (2000), for example). In the context of the labor market, the principle implies that the liability side of a payroll tax  i.e., whether it is imposed on employers or
employees  is irrelevant for the distribution of the tax burden.1 The study at
hand shows in a New Keynesian model that liability side equivalence holds in the long run, but that the liability side nevertheless matters for welfare costs of business cycle uctuations. In a model calibrated to a representative European country, a full shift of payroll taxation from rms to workers reduces the welfare loss from business cycle uctuations by 11.25%.
The otherwise standard DSGE model features a social security system that is funded by a payroll tax (social security contributions). The tax rate is assumed to be time variant because the government adjusts the rate in order to stabilize social security contributions over the cycle. When the tax base (gross total labor compensation) declines in a recession, the government ceteris paribus has to increase the tax rate to sustain constant revenues. Vice versa, a surging
tax base during upswings has to be compensated by a tax rate reduction.2 This
assumption is also made by Burda and Weder (2014), who also provide empirical evidence. Cyclical adjustments in the tax rate contribute to price and wage volatility, because changes in the tax rate lead rms and labor unions to adjust prices and wages. In a Calvo-setup, nominal volatility gives rise to price and wage dispersion, which impedes an ecient allocation of resources and reduces the economy's productive capacity. This productivity loss counts towards welfare costs of business cycles. Its emergence is summarized in Figure 1.
1If a payroll tax is imposed on workers, it is a labor income tax that lowers the net wage
for a given gross wage. Imposed on rms, payroll taxes scale up the eective wage bill for a given gross wage bill. In this paper, this distinction is made for the employer's portion and the employee's portion of social security contributions. Formally, rms pay the entire tax burden of both sides. However, because rms and workers usually negotiate over a gross wage that includes the worker contribution but excludes the rm contribution, the nominal tax burden is nevertheless split between both sides. Consider for example a German hourly minimum wage
of 8.50e, and a contributions rate of 40% split equally between both sides. The rm pays a total of 8.50e*1.2=10.20e per hour, of which 3.40e (2*1.70e, the sum of the contributions of both sides) are paid to the government, and 6.80e are paid to the worker. Since the worker contribution of 1.70e is deducted from the paycheck and paid to the government on her or his behalf, while the wage agreed upon is 8.50e, the worker portion of contributions is
economically a labor income tax.
2In reality, social security expenditures tend to move against the cycle, as e.g. unem-
ployment insurance requires more funding in downturns than in expansions (see Dolls et al. (2012), for example). This puts further pressure on a government to adjust the tax rate in a counter cyclical manner. This observation is neglected in the baseline model for the sake of tractability. However, it is accounted for in a robustness check, and shown to quantitatively strengthen the results of the paper.

The paper shows that the liability side of social security contributions aects the size of tax rate adjustments that are necessary to stabilize revenues over the cycle. If contributions are levied on workers, stabilizing revenues requires smaller adjustments in the tax rate than in the case when contributions are levied on rms. In Figure 1, this corresponds to a weaker link from business cycles (rst item) to tax rate adjustments (second item). As a result, given business cycle dynamics cause less volatility in the tax rate, which reduces the size of the productivity loss and thereby welfare costs. The explanation of this result is split into two steps: The next paragraph argues that taxing workers implies a larger tax base (relative to rm taxation), while the subsequent paragraph explains why this mitigates the productivity loss.
The fact that gross total labor compensation is larger under worker taxation is a corollary of liability side equivalence. Because the split of the tax incidence between both sides is the same under worker taxation and rm taxation, aftertax real wages have to be the same as well. This implies that pre-tax wages are higher if contributions are levied on workers, because they have to compensate for a nominal tax burden that is absent under the taxation of rms. With higher
nominal wages, gross total labor compensation (wage  hours) is larger as well,
since hours worked are virtually identical under both liability sides. The larger tax base has two implications. First, a given level of social secu-
rity revenues is generated by a smaller tax rate  . This does not aect the real
allocation, because social security revenues  and thereby the real tax burden  is assumed to be the same in both cases. Second, the government has to adjust the tax rate by less in order to stabilize revenues in the face of a given uctu-
ation in the tax base. To see why, denote revenues by   tax base, and note that deviations from the steady state can be decomposed into revenues =   tax base +   tax base, where bars denote steady state values and Deltas deviations. Maintaining constant revenues (i.e. revenues = 0) requires to adjust the tax rate by  = -( /tax base)  tax base in response to some uctuation taxbase. As explained above, taxing workers implies a larger (smaller) steady state tax base (tax rate), so ( /tax base) is smaller in magnitude. In Fig-
ure 1, this corresponds to a weakening of the mechanism symbolized by the rst arrow, and consequently reduces business cycle costs.
Payroll taxation represents a large component of public nance in developed nations, especially in Europe. In 2013, the total of employee and employer social security contributions exceeded a third of total labor costs in eight OECD
countries.3 These large gures result from a rapid growth of payroll tax rates
that started in 1960 (see Gruber (1997), for example). In the vast majority of European OECD countries, social contributions are not primarily levied on

Republic. See OECD Taxing Wages 2013.

workers (see Table 5 in the Appendix). In the light of the model, this suggests substantial scope to reduce business cycle costs.
There is a broad body of literature on liability side equivalence, with contributions from the elds of public nance, labor economics and behavioral economics. Mieszkowski (1967) provides a unied treatment of classic theoretical tax analysis. In labor economics, a strand of literature examines whether liability side equivalence holds in the presence of market imperfections, that is, in the context of eciency-wage and wage-bargaining models (see, among others, Picard and Toulemonde (2001), Rasmussen (1998) or Koskela and Schöb (1999)). Regarding empirical work, Lehmann et al. (2011) and Gruber (1997) are recent studies on the principle's validity. Weber and Schram (2013) conduct a laboratory experiment to analyze the implications of the liability side of payroll taxation under bounded rationality. The paper at hand is also loosely related to the literature on automatic stabilizers (see Furceri (2010) for a recent overview), as the liability side in the model passively aects nominal volatility caused by business cycles.
Section 2 lays out the model and discusses the calibration. Section 3 analyzes the implications of the liability side for the adjustment to exogenous shocks, which explain the welfare results presented in section 4. Section 5 provides robustness checks. The paper concludes with section 6.
2 The model
In the closed-economy New Keynesian DSGE model, the economy is populated by a continuum of rms and a continuum of innitely-lived households. Firms produce dierentiated intermediate goods, which are aggregated into a nal goods bundle consumed by households. Likewise, households supply dierentiated types of labor, which enter the production function subject to aggregation into a composite of labor services. Since dierent intermediate goods and dierent labor types are imperfect substitutes, rms and workers have market power. Price and wage setting are staggered by Calvo mechanisms. A social security system is nanced by payroll taxes and reimburses revenues as lump-sum transfers to households. Depending on the scenario, contributions are either levied on rms or on workers. A government consumes according to an exogenous process, with public consumption dened as plain waste. Its expenditures are fully nanced by lump-sum taxes in every period. Monetary policy is governed by a standard Taylor rule. There are two sources of uncertainty in the economy: productivity shocks and demand shocks that aect government spending.
2.1 Households
The index j  [0, 1] for households is suppressed for ease of notation. While
the consumption decision results from intertemporal optimization, hours worked are determined by labor demand as workers reduce their labor supply below the
4

competitive level. Lifetime utility is given by:


Ut = Et k
k=0

c1t+-k - nt1++k 1- 1+

,

where nt+k and ct+k are hours worked and consumption in period t + k. Maximization is subject to the series of period budget constraints for t  0:

1
Ptct + (1/Rt)bt  bt-1 + (1 - tw) wt nt (i) di + ssbt - taxt + t , (1)
0

where Pt is the economy's price index (dened below) and Rt is the gross nominal

interest rate on a one-period risk-free nominal bond bt maturing at the beginning

of t + 1. tw is the rate of employee's social security contributions, which are

deducted from nominal labor income wt

(the

same wage for its work at all dierent rms on the continuum, each indexed

by i.). Note that tw is zero in the scenario of taxing rms. The term ssbt

denotes lump-sum social security benets, taxt are lump-sum taxes levied by

the government and t denotes nominal prots from the ownership of rms.

The resulting Euler equation is:

Rt = Et

ct  Pt ct+k Pt+1

.

The Dixit-Stiglitz aggregate ct consists of all varieties ct (i) produced by rms on the continuum [0, 1]. Aggregation is undertaken by a competitive nal-goods

Cost-ecient composition of ct implies the following household demand for the variation produced by rm i, where pt (i) denotes its price:

The economy's aggregate price index is dened as:

2.2 Firms and price setting
Firm i produces its goods variation yt(i) with a linear production function:

(6)

Analogous to (3), cost-minimizing composition of nt(i) implies the following demand schedule for type-j labor:

nt (i, j) =

,

(7)

where wt(j) is the wage for type-j labor and Wt is the aggregate wage index:

Wt

(8)

Using (7) and (8), rm i's total wage bill can be expressed as:

1
1 + tf wt (j) nt (i, j) dj = 1 + tf Wtnt (i) ,

(9)

where tf is the rate of employers' social contributions (set to zero in the scenario
of taxing workers).
Total demand for the variety produced by rm i is given by

yt (i) =

(Ct + Gt)

(10)

The price setting problem of a rm i allowed to re-optimize its price pt(i) is:


max Et Qt,t+kk yt+k|t (i) pt (i) - t+k yt+k|t (i)
pt(i) k=0

,

where yt+k|t (i) is period t + k output if the price set today remains valid up to this period, which has probability k. The stochastic discount factor is Qt,t+k  k (ct+k/ct)- (Pt/Pt+k). The cost function t (.) represents the rm's total
wage bill (9), which under the use of (5) can be written as:

t+k yt+k|t (i)

=

1 + tf+k

Wt+k

yt+k|t (i) At+k

.

(11)

Optimal price setting (subject to demand schedule (10)) is governed by the following FOC that (jointly with (4)) implies a standard NKPC:


Et Qt,t+kkyt+k|t pt - ( - 1) (1 + tf+k)Wt+kAt-+1k = 0 .
k=0

(12)

6

The optimal new price pt is a markup over an expected weighted average of
eective marginal costs including the employer's portion of social security con-
tributions. A change in tf ceteris paribus moves pt and leads some rms to
re-adjust prices, which is symbolized by the second arrow in Figure 1.

2.3 Unions and wage setting

Nominal wage rigidity follows Erceg et al. (2000). Households exert market
power on the labor market because dierentiated labor services are imperfect
substitutes in (6). Each household j is represented by its own labor union that sets the household-specic wage rate wt (j) subject to a Calvo constraint, so only a random share 1 - w of unions can readjust each period. A union maximizes
the expected present value of utility perceived by the household it represents:



max Et

(w)k U ct+k|t (j) , nt+k|t (j)

wt (j )

k=0

,

where ct+k|t (j) and nt+k|t (j) are period t + k consumption and hours, if the newly set wage is still valid. The optimal wage wt satises the following FOC,
that (jointly with (8)) governs the evolution of aggregate wages:


Et (w)k M Ut+k|tnt+k|t
k=0

1 - tw+k

wt Pt+k

-

(

w

w
-

1) M RSt+k|t

= 0 (13)

where nt+k|t = (wt /Wt+k)- w Nt+k/stw+k is period t + k total demand for type-j labor, given that wt is valid.4 M Ut+k|t and M RSt+k|t denote household j's period t + k marginal utility and marginal rate of substitution, also conditional on wt. For wt , it holds that after-tax real wages are a mark-up
over an expected weighted average of marginal rates of substitution. Note that
because unions take after-tax wages into account, they eectively negotiate over
the wage inclusive of the employee's portion of social security contributions. A
change in tw ceteris paribus aects wt . The resulting wage re-adjustments are
also symbolized by the second arrow in Figure 1.

2.4 Social security system

Following Burda and Weder (2014), the social security system is funded by
payroll taxes and runs a balanced budget. The model allows contributions to
be levied on rms or workers (rate tw or tf ). The budget reads as

tw + tf NtWt = ssbt .

(14)

4Nt is the aggregate employment index (18) and swt is a wage dispersion term, both intro-

duced below. To derive this demand schedule, notice that a household charges the same wage

to all rms renting its labor service, so (7) implies that total demand for type-j labor is given

by nt (j) =

7

The tax base is gross total labor compensation NtWt, regardless of whether taxes are levied on rms or workers. ssbt denotes the system's expenditures,
which are reimbursed to households as lump-sum transfers. In the baseline
model, ssbt is assumed to uctuate exogenously, and is governed by

ssbt = ssb + t

with

t = ssbt-1 +

ssb t

.

(15)

The term ssb denotes steady state expenditures and

ssb t



N

0, ssb

induces

innovations to the stochastic component t. Depending on whether the scenario

is the taxation of rms or workers, one tax rate is set to zero:

 w = 0 (if taxing rms) or  f = 0 (if taxing workers)

(16)

For given tax base and given expenditures, (14) determines (tw + tf ) such
that the budget is balanced. Since one of the two rates is set zero by (16), both rates are determined. The non-zero tax rate is referred to as social contributions rate or SCR. (14) and (16) jointly govern how the SCR adjusts in order to stabilize revenues in the face of uctuations in the tax base. These adjustments are counter cyclical because the tax base tends to move with output, so upswings ceteris paribus require a downward-adjustment of the SCR to keep revenues constant (and the other way round in downturns). In Figure 1, this is symbolized by the rst arrow.
Shocks to expenditures ssbt (induced by t) are an additional source of vari-
ation in the SCR, as they ceteris paribus require revenues to move accordingly
under a balanced budget. Since ssbt is exogenous in the baseline model, SCR
changes from this source are not correlated with output.5 Hence, a higher
volatility of sbbt means that independent SCR uctuations are stronger, so the
SCR's negative correlation with output  induced by tax base movements  becomes weaker. This is exploited in the calibration of the model. As discussed
later on, the dynamics of independent uctuations (governed by ssb and ssb)
is chosen such that resulting SCR dynamics resemble an empirically plausible pattern in a calibration-scenario of equal taxation of both sides.

Irrelevance of the social security system for household income
Equations (14)-(16) are irrelevant for the income of the representative household, because social security contributions  which either reduce the representative household's prot income or labor income  are fully reimbursed as lump-sum transfers. Hence, if we abstract from distortions (which is admissible for this exercise since distortions are the same under both liability sides), the only implication of (14)-(16) is to govern above-mentioned dynamic adjustments in the SCR, which in turn cause re-adjustments of prices or wages (see (12) and (13)).
The model specication thus abstracts from all macroeconomic implications of the social system beyond its relevance for price and wage adjustments. This
5As a robustness check, ssbt is assumed to move counter cyclical, to account for the ob-
served behavior of unemployment benets (see the literature on automatic stabilizers). It is shown to strengthen the results of this paper.

property is suitable for the exercise, as explained in the following. The two

scenarios under comparison only dier with regard to the liability side, and

the liability side does not aect the level of social security contributions  it

how how muchdetermines

, but not

of the latter are raised. The amount of

resources available to the social system is therefore identical in both scenarios,

and the way they are spend is also the same. Hence, only the implications of the

social system for price and wage adjustments dier across both scenarios. This

allows us to abstract from all other implications, since they are constant across

scenarios and therefore drop out in the comparison of the model distributions

under both liability sides. This model property rationalizes the calibration
strategy for the dynamics of ssbt in (15). Since changes in ssbt are meaningless
in the model apart from triggering SCR adjustments, their dynamics do not

aect other variables and can be freely used to generate empirically plausible

SCR-dynamics in the calibration-scenario.

With this calibration strategy  which is discussed in detail in section 2.7 

the analysis can also be applied to countries that do not adhere to a balanced

budget rule. Abandoning this rule means that when revenues and expenditures

would ceteris paribus diverge, only a portion of the distance between the two

variables is covered by adjusting revenues (i.e. by changing the SCR), while

the remainder of the dierence is covered by borrowing or lending. Empirically

observed changes in the SCR reect only the use of the rst policy option to

counteract an emerging divergence between revenues and expenditures. Cal-

ibrating (15) as to match observed SCR dynamics in the calibration-scenario

therefore means that the model replicates only the portion of cyclical budgetary

pressure that results in SCR adjustments. However, only this portion is relevant

for the mechanism presented in this paper, since the latter is based on the use

of SCR adjustments to balance the budget.

2.5 Fiscal and Monetary Policy

As common in the literature, exogenous disturbances in aggregate demand are
introduced by stochastic government spending. Gt is dened as plain waste and
exogenously determined by:

Gt =

1 - G

G + GGt-1 +

G t

,

(17)

with

G t



N

0, G .6

Expenditures are fully nanced by lump-sum taxes in

every period, so Gt = taxt. Note that combining government consumption and

social security into one entity would not change the model.

Monetary policy is assumed to target zero ination. Its policy is governed
by the following standard Taylor rule, where t+1 = Pt+1/Pt :

Rt = -1 +  (t+1 - 1) .
6This specication of public spending is widely used in the literature, such as Evers (2012),
for example.

9

2.6 Resource constraint

The constraint accounts for resource costs resulting from ineciencies in the
equilibrium allocation due to price and wage dispersion, which is symbolized
by the third arrow in Figure 1. Closely related to Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe
(2007), the relation between output of the nal consumption good and the
required amount of labor is established by dening aggregate employment Nt as total labor of all households j at all rms i:

Nt =

nt (i, j) didj .

2.7 Calibration
Table 1 shows the baseline calibration for a typical member country of the
European Union. It largely follows Evers (2012), who calibrates a related model
to members of the EMU. Calvo probabilities for price and wage rigidity are
chosen to match the empirical ndings of Druant et al. (2009). In their study on
the Euro Area, they report an average lifetime of prices and wages of 9.6 and 12.5
months respectively (excluding the outlier Italy). Elasticities of substitution
between dierent good variations and labor types match 11% price mark-up
and 15% wage mark-up, as estimated in Basu and Kimball (1997) and Chari
et al. (2002). Steady state government consumption G = 0.2 (22% of GDP)
is also used in Evers (2012). The size of the social system in the steady state
ssb is 14.2% GDP. This gure is at the higher end of the observed spectrum
(see Table 5 in the Appendix), but well below the values observed in Austria,
Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Germany and the Netherlands.
For the stochastic component of social security expenditures, we use ssb = 0.0007 (corresponding to a SD of 0.5% of steady state expenditures) and ssb = 0.95. This calibration is chosen because the model then generates moments sd(scr) = 0.35% and corr(scr, gdp) = -0.4 in the calibration-scenario of equal taxation of rms and workers, i.e. when using tw = tf  t instead of (16). On the background of the empirical observations of corr(scr, gdp) from Burda and Weder (2014) and analogously computed observations of sd(scr) (see Tables 4
and 6 in the Appendix), this can be regarded as a typical dynamic pattern.7 The
reason to target these moments under equal taxation of both sides is that they
are shown to depend on the liability side, and are thus generated by dierent
parameter depending on whether the tax is levied on rms or workers. Table 5
7Dierent dynamics are examined as a robustness check.

10

in the Appendix shows that the statutory breakdown of contributions between
rms and workers varies widely across EU countries. Targeting the moments of
the SCR under equal taxation of both sides constitutes an agnostic approach.
The calibration strategy for the exogenous processes of productivity and
government spending is the same as in Evers (2012). The standard value of
A = 0.95 is used for productivity shocks, while the remaining parameters G, A and G are calibrated as to match observed moments of government spending
and output in the Euro Area.8

3 Shock adjustment under dierent liablity sides

This section contrast the model adjustment to exogenous shocks under the tax-

ation of rms and workers. In particular, we study deviations of social security

expenditures (t in (15)), of productivity (At in (5)) and of government spending

(

G t

in (17)).

Throughout this section, lines without markers depict deviations

in the scenario of the taxation of rms, while marked lines show the adjustment

under the statutory taxation of workers.

8His sample covers nine European countries (Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland,
Italy, Netherlands, Portugal and Spain) over the period 1999Q1 to 2007Q4. Applying an HP
lter with smoothing parameter 1600 on data in logs, he reports standard deviations of output
and government spending of 0.87% and 0.83% respectively. Targeting both moments as well
as their ratio yields values of G, A and G that are roughly in line with his calibration.

3.1 Exogenous variation of expenditures
Figure 2 shows the adjustment to a reduction in social security expenditures ssbt by 1% of steady state GDP. As outlined in section 2.4, the reduction in ssbt itself
is without consequence in the model, since it does not aect household income. However, the associated SCR-reduction  which is required under a balanced budget to lower revenues in line with expenditures  aects prices and wages, and thereby all other variables in general equilibrium. This SCR-adjustment is smaller under the taxation of workers (4th row, 2nd column), because the steady state tax base is larger in this case (as explained in the introduction), so a given SCR adjustment has a stronger impact on revenues.
Under the taxation of rms, the decline of the SCR directly reduces eective marginal costs (which include contributions), so rms reduce prices and the central bank responds by lowering the real interest rate. Consumption and output surge as a result. Regarding wages, we observe a decline in wage ination but an increase in after-tax real wages. To see why, recall that labor unions' FOC (13) schedules a stabilization of expected after-tax real wages around a markup over expected marginal rates of substitution. The strong decline in prices elevates after-tax real wages above the level that is optimal for the equilibrium path of the MRS, so labor unions reduce nominal wages. The adjustment of wage ination has a hump-shaped form because at the beginning of the adjustment, the downward pressure on wages is oset by the initial jump of the MRS, which in turn results from the initial surge in hours.

Figure 2: Reduction of social security benets in the magnitude of 1% GDP; Taxing rms (solid lines) vs. taxing workers (marked lines)

Turning to the taxation of workers (marked lines), we observe that the initial surge in output and hours has roughly one third of its magnitude under rm taxation. The reason is that the initial reduction in marginal costs is almost negligible in comparison to its adjustment under rm taxation, which implies a dramatically weaker decline in prices, leading the central bank to implement a more timid reduction in the real rate. The weaker decline in marginal costs is for two reasons. First, the SCR reduction does not directly aect marginal costs, as it is the case under rm taxation. Instead, a lower contributions rate only aects marginal costs to the extent that it leads to a staggered downwardadjustment of wages. Second, the decline in the SCR itself is weaker, as the steady state tax base is larger (see above). Regarding wages, we again observe a decline in newly set nominal wages but a rise in after-tax real wages. The reduction of social contributions paid by workers pushes after-tax wages on a level above the optimal one for the given path of the MRS, so newly set wages are lowered.
To conclude this exercise, note that under worker taxation, the reduction in social security expenditures causes a smaller deviation of output, consumption,

13

prices and wages. While it is not surprising that prices are more stable  the SCR change is smaller and aects them only indirectly  it is noteworthy that also wages adjust by less under worker taxation, although the SCR change directly aect them in this case. This is due to the smaller size of the SCR adjustment, as well as to the negative deviation of the MRS after period 7, which lowers the optimal wage that unions seek to implement.

3.2 Productivity shocks

Figure 3 shows that the adjustment to a productivity shock is mildly dierent

in both scenarios. In either case, the positive deviation of productivity (one SD

of

A t

in (5)) reduces marginal costs and with it prices.

This leads the central

bank to lower the real interest rate, in turn causing households to increase

consumption. Since the shock reduces the amount of hours required per unit of

output, labor demand and hours decline despite the surge in GDP. The MRS

deviates positively because the decline in marginal utility overcompensates the

decline in the disutility of labor. In the wage setting decision of unions, the

higher MRS is weighted against the decline in consumer prices that pushes up

real wages. As the latter dominates, unions lower wages. Regarding the social

security system, the shock raises total labor compensation, which would ceteris

paribus cause a surge in revenues. Since expenditures remain unchanged, the

balanced budget requires to lower the SCR in order to hold revenues constant

as well. This SCR adjustment is smaller if contributions are levied on workers

because the steady state tax base is higher (as discussed in the introduction).

All dierences between the adjustment to the productivity shock in both

scenarios originate from the dierent impact of the SCR-reduction, because the

liability side is irrelevant for the shock adjustment if the SCR were constant.

This allows us to explain the dierences in the adjustment under both scenarios
on the basis of the results from the previous exercise. Since the change in ssbt

is irrelevant for household income, the economy's adjustment in the precious

exercise is fully attributed to the associated SCR-reduction. Because the SCR

is also lowered in the course of the productivity shock, the adjustment discussed

in the previous subsection is also present in this exercise  in addition to the

impact of the productivity shock. For example, we observe that the adjustment

path of wage ination is lower under rm taxation. The reason is that the

downward-adjustment of the SCR then exerts stronger downward-pressure on

this variable, as shown in the previous exercise.

3.3 Demand shocks

Figure 6 in the Appendix shows the impact of a positive innovation in

G t

(equa-

tion (17)) in the magnitude of one standard deviation. Regarding the general

adjustment, most of the additional government consumption is covered by a

surge in output, implying a very mild consumption crowding out. This is due

to wage rigidity: As nominal wages adjust slowly to the increment in disutility

of labor, the rise in output only causes a moderate hike in marginal costs. This

limits the induced ination and thereby the strength of the resulting contrac-

tionary monetary policy stance. The output expansion implies an increase in

total labor compensation, which requires a downward adjustment of the SCR.

Unlike in the previous two exercises, there is no clear-cut picture on which

liability side is favorable in terms of reducing uctuations in macroeconomic

aggregates. The welfare analysis will show that the taxation of workers reduces

price and wage volatility, but only to a negligible extent.

4 Welfare analysis

This section compares the welfare costs of business cycle uctuations  measured by consumption compensation  under both liability sides. The consumption

15

compensation  is dened as the percentage reduction of consumption in the de-
terministic steady state for which an agent is equally well o in the deterministic
steady state and in the stochastic environment.9 It is determined by:

The LHS denotes the unconditional expectation of household welfare in the
ergodic distribution of the model with social contributions fully levied on the
respectively side. The model distribution is dierent under both liability sides
because the latter aects the adjustment to shocks. The RHS is household
welfare in the deterministic steady state, given that consumption is reduced by
the respective consumption compensation f or w (which are negative). The
allocation in the deterministic steady state is independent from the liability side
because liability side equivalence holds in the exible-price allocation. c¯ and n¯
are thus the same under both liability sides, so dierences in the LHS between
both scenarios translate into dierences between f and w . Following Evers (2012), both sides of (20) are approximated to express f
and w as a function of rst and second moments of the ergodic distribution.
This allows us to decompose the total welfare loss into the following four com-
ponents: The contributions of volatility in consumption and hours and the con-
tributions of level eects in these two variables (dened as dierences between
the variables' unconditional expectations in the ergodic distribution and their
value in the deterministic steady).10 To obtain the moments used in the welfare
function, the model is written recursively as in Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2007)
and solved in Dynare by a second-order accurate perturbation method. To
eliminate the inaccuracy involved in simulating the model, population moments
are computed analytically by applying the nonlinear moving average method of
Lan and Meyer-Gohde (2013). This approach withstands the critique of Kim
and Kim (2003), who show that meaningful welfare analyses require at least a
second-order accurate approximation to the system of equations.

4.1 Welfare results
Table 2 presents the results of the welfare analysis and moments of selected variables. Labels Workers and Firms indicate that the tax is levied on the respective side. The gures are reported for the full stochastic setup (labeled All shocks), as well as for two setups in which either demand shocks or productivity shocks are deactivated. For the reported moments, columns labeled %-di  show their dierence under both liability sides, as a percentage share of the value under worker taxation. The same holds for the total welfare loss, where a positive value indicates that the loss becomes more severe under rm taxation (the negative compensation becomes larger). For the four components of the
9This commonly applied measure goes back to Lucas (1987) and Lucas (2003). 10Details on the functions and their derivation are provided in the Appendix.

16

welfare loss, %-di  also presents dierences between both scenarios, but as a share of the total loss under worker taxation. Here, a positive value indicates that the respective component contributes to a worsening of the welfare loss under rm taxation, while a negative value means that the component mitigates
the loss.11
Before we compare the outcomes under both liability sides, we make two general observations that hold in either scenario. First, in each of the three stochastic setups, level eects greatly dominate volatility eects in the decom-
position of the welfare loss.12 Second, the total welfare loss if there are no
productivity shocks is insignicant compared to the loss that arises if there
are no demand shocks.13 Hence, since demand shocks and volatility eects are
of secondary importance, we can focus on level eects caused by productivity shocks to explain the total welfare loss in the full stochastic setup.
These level eects arise because productivity is lower in the stochastic environment, which leads households to work fewer hours and consume less (which lowers welfare since the loss from forgone consumption is roughly three times as large as the gain from more leisure). The source of the productivity loss is price and wage volatility, which is under Calvo-rigidity accompanied by dispersion
among prices and wages.14 Price dispersion leads households to consume dif-
ferent quantities of dierent good variations, while wage dispersion leads rms to employ dierent amounts of dierent types of labor. As a result, Jensen's Inequality applies in aggregators (2) and (6) and raises the total amount of good variations required to bundle one unit of the nal good, as well as the amount of total labor required to bundle one unit of the labor composite. Less output of the nal good for given labor input means that productivity is lower, which manifests in the aggregate resource constraint (19) as resource costs.
Finally turning to the comparison of model distributions under both liability sides, we observe that in the full stochastic setup, total welfare costs are by 11.25% higher under rm taxation. The reason is that SCR-adjustments are dramatically larger, implying that the SCR's standard deviation is by 35.78% higher than under worker taxation  in line with the shock adjustments shown in Figures 2 and 3. Larger SCR-adjustments lead to stronger adjustments in prices and wages, so the standard deviations of price and wage ination are by
11For example, in the full stochastic setup, lower mean consumption under rm taxation
increases this component of the welfare loss, in a magnitude that corresponds to 15.58% of the total loss under worker taxation. In contrast, fewer hours worked under rm taxation mitigate the welfare loss by 4.31% of the total loss under worker taxation.
12Consider for example the full stochastic setup and the taxation of workers. Summing up
over consumption and hours, level eects cause a welfare loss of -0.1458 + 0.0735 = -0.0723 units, while volatility eects lead to a loss of -0.0061 - 0.0016 = -0.0077 units.
13This observation ts the explanation of Figure 1, which attributes the welfare loss to
nominal volatility. Comparing the adjustment to productivity and demand shocks (Figures 3 and 6) shows that a productivity shock induces about ten times stronger deviations of price and wage ination, although the impact on output only diers by the factor two. Productivity disturbances are thus substantially more relevant for nominal volatility.
14Whenever the optimal price (wage) changes, entities that are allowed to re-adjust set a
price (wage) dierent from the price (wage) that remains valid for the non-adjusting entities.

5.99% respectively 2.87% higher than under worker taxation.15 Higher nominal
volatility increases mean price and wage dispersion by 12.29% and 5.78% respectively, implying a stronger productivity loss. The latter leads to lower output, consumption and hours worked. This increases the welfare loss, because the gain from working fewer hours (4.31% of the total loss under worker taxation) is dominated by the loss from lower consumption (15.58% of the total loss under worker taxation).
Up to this point, model distributions under the exclusive taxation of rms respectively workers were compared. Figure 5 in the Appendix considers intermediate cases, by plotting the welfare loss as a function of the statutory share of contributions levied on rms. The loss depends almost perfectly linear on the statutory breakdown of social contributions between rms and workers.
5 Robustness analysis
Before we consider variations of key parameter values, we rst modify the dy-
namics of social security expenditures (ssbt in (15)) in order to generate dierent
SCR-dynamics in the calibration-scenario of equal taxation of rms and workers.
Again note that changes in ssbt only aect other variables via the associated SCR-adjustments (see section 2.4), so the dynamics of ssbt are a suitable de-

vice to introduce dierent SCR-dynamics. In order to allow for a broad set of

dynamics in ssbt, an ad-hoc dependency of ssbt on output uctuations is introduced. To this aim, the time-variant component of ssbt in equation (15) is

governed by

expenditures. Vice versa,  > 0 weakens the countercyclicality of the SCR:

a positive technology shock then leads to higher social security expenditures,

which counteracts the downward-adjustment in the SCR that stems from the

surging tax base.

Figure 4 shows the percentage increase in welfare costs under rm taxation

relative to worker taxation  derived in the same way as in Table 2  as a
function of SCR-dynamics in the calibration-scenario (summarized by sd(scr) and corr(scr, gdp)).16 The gure reported in Table 2 is found at sd(scr) = 0.35% and -corr(scr, gdp) = 0.4. The table next to the gure contains the same

Figure 4: Welfare results in dependency of baseline SCR-dynamics

The dierence in welfare costs between both scenarios increases in sd(scr) and in -corr(scr, gpd). The increment in sd(scr) is straightforward to explain:
Under worker taxation, a given adjustment in revenues can be implemented by
a smaller change in the contributions rate. However, a low value of sd(scr) in
16For each point on the sd(scr)-corr(scr, gdp) plane,  and ssb are adjusted such that
the respective moments are generated by the model under equal taxation of rms and workers. Then, for each point, the dierence in the welfare loss under worker and rm taxation computed and plotted.

19

the calibration-scenario means that required adjustments in revenues are small on average, so the liability side makes less of a dierence for SCR-volatility and thereby for welfare. To explain why the welfare dierence increases in
-corr(scr, gpd), rst note that SCR-adjustments can oset some of the adjust-
ment pressure on prices and wages that results from shocks driving business cycle uctuations. This occurs whenever the adjustment pressure on nominal variables resulting from an SCR-adjustment has the opposite direction than the adjustment pressure from a business cycle shock. Such an oset leads to a reduction in the overall size of price and wage adjustments. The higher the probability of an oset, the lower is the reduction in nominal volatility that can be achieved by reducing the average size of SCR-adjustments. The reason is that by downsizing SCR-adjustments, one also mitigates the size of the reduction in nominal adjustments that results from an oset. In the extreme
case of corr(scr, gdp) = 0, SCR-adjustments are independent from shocks that
drive business cycle uctuations of output, so the probability of an oset is 50%. In this case, lowering the expected size of SCR-adjustments by taxing workers instead of rms leads to virtually no reduction in nominal volatility and welfare costs. The reason is that the mitigation of the consequences of an oset balances out with the reduction in nominal adjustment from SCR-adjustments
when there is no oset. With higher values of -corr(scr, gdp), the likelihood of
an oset is declining, because an oset typically occurs when an output devia-
tion and an SCR-adjustment have the same direction.17 This means that the
adverse side eect of having smaller SCR-adjustments under worker taxation  i.e. to limit the impact of osets  becomes less important. As a result, taxing workers causes a stronger reduction of nominal volatility and welfare costs.
Quantitatively, the welfare implications of the liability side are signicant already for a mild countercyclicality and a mild volatility of the SCR  which is in general the case, given the observed dynamics reported in Table 4 and 6.
5.1 Sensitivity to model parameters
Table 3 shows welfare results and moments of selected variables in the same way as Table 2, but for several parameter variations. For each parameter variation,
the calibration of expenditures (21) is adjusted such that sd(scr) = 0.35% and corr(scr, gdp) = -0.4 are valid in the calibration-scenario of equal taxation
of both sides. Without these adjustments, SCR-dynamics in the calibrationscenario would dier across parameter variations because the latter aect the dynamics of total labor compensation (the tax base), and thereby of social security revenues.
17Since most of the variation in GDP stems from productivity shocks, GDP tends to move
in the opposite direction than prices and wages (see Figure 3). In contrast, SCR-adjustments drag prices and wages in their own direction (see Figure 2). Hence, when a productivityinduced output deviation and a SCR-adjustment have the opposite direction, the adjustment pressure on nominal variables from both sources has the same direction.

Exercise A: Less responsive monetary policy
 = 1.301 reduces the responsiveness of monetary policy relative to the baseline
calibration. This parameter approximates the monetary policy stance faced by a member country of the Euro Zone core region dened as Germany, France, Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands. A large body of literature reports a
high degree of business cycle synchronization among these counties.18 Under
the simplifying assumption of perfect synchronization, monetary policy reacts to ination in a core region-country with the same strength as to ination in a hypothetical country that has the size of the entire core region taken
together.19 The core region covers more than half of the population of the
18See e.g. de Haan (2008) and Jones et al. (2012), or the classic study of Bayoumi and
Eichengreen (1994), who report a high synchronization of supply shocks.
19Under perfect synchronization, ination rates are perfectly correlated across core region
countries, so each country has eectively the same weight in the ECB's Taylor rule as the

21

Euro Zone, and has a weight of 60.2% in the ECB's average ination measure (using 2014 HICP country weights). In order to adjust the responsiveness of the real interest rate accordingly, the active portion of monetary policy (i.e., the change of the nominal interest rate in excess of the ination rate) is weighted by
0.602. This yields a Taylor coecient of  = 1 + 0.5  0.602 = 1.301. For this
calibration, the welfare loss is by 9.22% higher under rm taxation, which is a slight reduction of the liability side's welfare implications relative to the main calibration.
Exercises B1, B2 and B3: Varying price and wage rigidity
Exercises B1, B2 and B3 investigate the role of nominal rigidity of prices and wages. B1 considers the case of symmetric price and wage rigidity. It sets
 = w = 0.75 (implying a one-year expected lifetime of prices and wages),
which increases price rigidity relative to the baseline calibration, but leaves wage rigidity almost unchanged. With a dierence in the welfare loss of 10.53%, the results do not change signicantly. B2 and B3 consider non-symmetric rigidity:
In B2, prices are expected to last for 5 quarters ( = 0.8), while wages are signicantly more exible and have a lifetime of only 3 quarters (w = 0.667).
B3 considers the opposite case, in which prices are expected to last for only
3 quarters, but wages for 5 quarters ( = 0.667 and w = 0.8). The results
show that when prices are more rigid than wages, the welfare implication of the liability side decreases to 8.42%. However, in the more plausible case of higher wage rigidity (which closely resembles the baseline calibration), the gure is 11.35%.
Exercise C: Smaller social security system
This exercise sets ssb = 0.09, which implies a steady state size of the social
security system of 10% GDP (compared to 14.2% in the baseline calibration). This value is at the lower end of the range observed in OECD countries: Only Denmark, Ireland, Norway, Portugal and the UK have smaller social systems. Under this calibration, the dierence between the welfare loss under both liability sides is 10.54%, a slight reduction compared to the main calibration.
Exercise D: Increased curvature of labor disutility
The baseline-parameter for the Frisch elasticity of labor supply 1/ = 1 is
common in the New Keynesian literature. To check the robustness with regard
to this parameter, exercise D considers the value  = 2, which implies a Frisch
elasticity of 0.5. The results show that the eect on the dierence between the welfare loss under both liability sides is weak: Business cycle costs are by 9.77% higher if contributions are levied on rms.
entire core region as a whole.

6 Conclusion
This paper shows that the liability side of social security contributions matters in a New-Keynesian DSGE model for the volatility of prices and wages, and thereby for the welfare loss of business cycle uctuations. Calibrating the model to a typical Eurozone country with a sizable welfare system, taxing workers lowers price and wage volatility by 5.99% and 2.87% relative to the taxation of rms, which implies a reduction of the welfare loss by 11.25%.
In the unconditional mean of the model distribution, all agents are better o under worker taxation, while the ratio between after-tax prots and after-tax labor income is independent from the liability side due to liability side equivalence. However, a regime switch towards worker taxation causes transitory redistribution of labor income towards rm prots. The reason is that nominal rigidity prevents wages to adjust instantaneously when the nominal tax burden is shifted towards workers. Hence, the initial ratio between after-tax rm prots and after-tax labor income is only restored  and the transitory redistribution undone  when the nominal adjustment to the tax shift is completed. This has to be taken into account in a normative evaluation of the policy.
The structure of the model is rich enough to generate the role of the liability side, but abstracts from features that are potentially relevant for the nding. The introduction of credit-constrained households that do not earn prot income (Galí et al. (2004)) constitutes a promising extension of the model. With this feature, above mentioned transitory uctuations in the ratio between labor income and prots imply redistribution between the two groups of households. This in turn aects aggregate demand because credit-constrained households have a propensity to consume of one. Since the liability side would determine the direction of the cyclical redistribution, it would have further implications for the business cycle. Other promising directions for future research are the inclusion of capital and allowing for trade in an open economy setup. The latter is especially interesting in the context of a monetary union. The literature on optimum currency areas identies price stickiness as the root cause for the costs
of belonging to a union.20 The liability side, with its impact on cyclical price
setting, could be of relevance for these costs.

Derivation of welfare functions:
The sum on the LHS of equation (20) comprises unconditional expectations of utility on the ergodic distribution, while the sum on the RHS comprises utility in the deterministic steady state. As neither quantity depends on time, and they are therefore constant in the sum, equation (20) can be written as:

E [U (ct, nt)] = U ((1 + ) c, n) .

the deterministic steady state yields:

where the bar denotes variables in the deterministic steady state and the cross term is neglected, as commonly done in the literature. On the RHS, applying

yields:

It follows that the total consumption compensation for business cycle uctuations is a sum of the following components of the total welfare loss:

mean C = U / -1 U C E [ct - c] mean N = U / -1 U N E [nt - n] volatility C = U / -1 0.5U CC E [ct - c]2 volatility N = U / -1 0.5U NN E [nt - n]2
