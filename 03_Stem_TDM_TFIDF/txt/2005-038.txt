Abstract
As a main step in the numerical solution of control problems in continuous time, the controlled process is approximated by sequences of controlled Markov chains, thus discretising time and space. A new feature in this context is to allow for delay in the dynamics. The existence of an optimal strategy with respect to the cost functional can be guaranteed in the class of relaxed controls. Weak convergence of the approximating extended Markov chains to the original process together with convergence of the associated optimal strategies is established.

1 Introduction

A general strategy for rendering control problems in continuous time accessible to numerical computation is the following: Taking as a starting point the original dynamics, construct a family of control problems in discrete time with discrete state space and discretized cost functional. Standard numerical schemes can be applied to nd an optimal control and to calculate the minimal costs for each of the discrete control problems. The important point to establish is then whether the discrete optimal controls and minimal costs converge to the continuous-time limit as the mesh size of the discretisation tends to zero. If that is the case, then the discrete control problems are a valid approximation to the original problem.
Approximation schemes for non-delay stochastic control problems in continuous time implementing the general strategy just outlined are well established, see Kushner and Dupuis (2001). The method yields convergence results under very general conditions.

In the non-delay case Krylov (2000) derived rates of convergence for those schemes by exploiting ne analytical properties of the associated Bellman equations.
The dynamics of the control problem we are interested in are described by a stochastic delay dierential equation (SDDE). Thus, the future evolution of the dynamics may depend not only on the present state, but also on the past evolution. For an exposition of the general theory of SDDEs see Mohammed (1984) or Mao (1997). The development of numerical methods for SDDEs has attracted much attention recently, see Buckwar (2000), Hu et al. (2004) and the references therein. In Calzolari et al. (2003), segmentwise Euler schemes are used in a non-linear ltering problem for approximating the state process, which is given by an SDDE. Numerical procedures for deterministic control with delayed dynamics have already been used in applications, see Boucekkine et al. (2005) for the analysis of an economic growth model. The algorithm proposed there is based on the discretisation method studied here, but no formal proof of convergence is given.
The mathematical analysis of stochastic control problems with time delay in the state equation has been the object of recent works, see e. g. Elsanosi et al. (2000) for certain explicitly available solutions, Øksendal and Sulem (2001) for the derivation of a maximum principle and Larssen (2002) for the dynamic programming approach. Although one can invoke the dynamic programming principle to derive a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation for the value function, such an equation will in general be a non-linear partial dierential equation on a functional state space. The analytical approaches for the non-delay case do not simply carry over to this innite-dimensional setting. Another approach to treat stochastic control problems with delay is based on representing the state equation as an evolution equation in Hilbert space, see Bensoussan et al. (1992).
The class of control problems is specied in Section 2. In Section 3 we prove the existence of optimal strategies for those problems in the class of relaxed controls. Section 4 introduces the approximating processes and provides a tightness result. Finally, in Section 5 the discrete control problems are dened and the convergence of the minimal costs and optimal strategies is shown.
2 The control problem
We consider the control of a dynamical system given by a one-dimensional stochastic delay dierential equation (SDDE) driven by a Wiener process. Both drift and diusion coecient may depend on the solution's history a certain amount of time into the past.
Let r > 0 denote the delay length, i. e. the maximal length of dependence on the past.
For simplicity, we restrict attention to the case, where only the drift term can be directly controlled.
Typically, the solution process of an SDDE does not enjoy the Markov property, while
the segment process associated with that solution does. For a real-valued càdlàg function (i. e., right-continuous function with left-hand limits)  living on the time interval [-r, )
2

the segment at time t  [0, ) is dened to be the function

t : [-r, 0]  R,

t(s) := (t+s).

Thus, the segment process (Xt)t0 associated with a real-valued càdlàg process (X (t))t-r takes its values in D0 := D([-r, 0]), the space of all real-valued càdlàg functions on the interval [-r, 0]. There are two natural topologies on D0. The rst is the one induced by the supremum norm. The second is the Skorohod topology of càdlàg convergence (e. g.
Billingsley, 1999). The main dierence between the Skorohod and the uniform topology lies
in the dierent evaluation of convergence of functions with jumps, which appear naturally
as initial segments and discretized processes. For continuous functions both topologies
coincide. Similar statements hold for D := D([-r, )) and D~  := D([0, )), the spaces of all real-valued càdlàg functions on the intervals [-r, ) and [0, ), respectively. The spaces D and D~  will always be supposed to carry the Skorohod topology, while D0 will
canonically be equipped with the uniform topology.
Let (, d) be a compact metric space, the space of control actions. Denote by b the drift coecient of the controlled dynamics, and by  the diusion coecient. Let (W (t))t0 be a one-dimensional standard Wiener process on a ltered probability space (, F , (Ft)t0, P) satisfying the usual conditions, and let (u(t))t0 be a control process, i. e. an (Ft)-adapted measurable process with values in . Consider the controlled SDDE

(1) dX(t) = b Xt, u(t) dt + (Xt) dW (t), t  0.

The control process u(.) together with its stochastic basis including the Wiener process is called an admissible control if, for every deterministic initial condition   D0, equation (1) has a unique solution which is also weakly unique. Write Uad for the set of admissible
controls of equation (1). The stochastic basis coming with an admissible control will often
be omitted in the notation.
A solution in the sense used here is an adapted càdlàg process dened on the stochastic
basis of the control process such that the integral version of equation (1) is satised. Given
a control process together with a standard Wiener process, a solution to equation (1) is
unique if it is indistinguishable from any other solution almost surely satisfying the same initial condition. A solution is weakly unique if it has the same law as any other solution
with the same initial distribution and satisfying equation (1) for a control process on a
possibly dierent stochastic basis so that the joint distributions of control and driving
Wiener process are the same for both solutions. Let us specify regularity assumptions to
be imposed on the coecients b and :

(A1) Càdlàg functionals: the mappings

(, )  t  b(t, ), t  0 ,

  t  (t), t  0

dene measurable functionals D ×   D~  and D  D~ , respectively, where D, D~  are equipped with their Borel -algebras.

(A2) Continuity of the drift coecient: there is a countable subset of [-r, 0], denoted by Iev , such that for every t  0 the function dened by D ×  (, )  b(t, ) is continuous on Dev(t) ×  uniformly in   , where Dev(t) := {  D |  is continuous at t + s for all s  Iev}.

(A3) Global boundedness: |b|, || are bounded by a constant K > 0.
(A4) Uniform Lipschitz condition: There is a constant KL > 0 such that for all , ~  D0, all   
|b(, ) - b(~, )| + |() - (~)|  KL sup |(s) - ~(s)|.
s[-r,0]
(A5) Ellipticity of the diusion coecient: ()  0 for all   D0, where 0 > 0 is a
positive constant.

Assumptions (A1) and (A4) on the coecients allow us to invoke Theorem V.7 in Protter
(2003: p.253), which guarantees the existence of a unique solution to the controlled SDDE
(1) for every piecewise constant control attaining only nitely many dierent values. The
boundedness Assumption (A3) poses no limitation except for the initial conditions, because
the state evolution will be stopped when the state process leaves a bounded interval.
Assumption (A2) allows us to use segmentwise approximations of the solution process,
see the proof of Proposition 1. The assumptions imposed on the drift coecient b are
satised, for example, by
00
(2) b(, ) := f (r1), . . . , (rn), (s)w1(s)ds, . . . , (s)wm(s)ds · g(),
-r -r
where r1, . . . , rn  [-r, 0] are xed, f , g are bounded continuous functions and f is Lipschitz, and the weight functions w1, . . . , wm lie in L1([-r, 0]).
Apart from the control term, the diusion coecient  may have the same structure as b in (2). We next give an example of a function that could be taken for  if the
càdlàg continuity in Assumption (A1) were missing. In Section 4 it will become clear
that the corresponding control problem cannot be approximated by a simple discretisation
procedure, because the evaluation of () for any   D0 depends on the discretisation grid. Let AM be the subset of the interval [-r, 0] given by

AM :=

(t - 2-3M , t]

t

=

r(

n 2M

- 1) for some n  {1, . . . , 2M }

.

Let A be the union of the sets AM , M  N. With positive constants 0, K , we dene a functional  : D0  R by

(3) () := 0 + K  sup |(t) - (t-)| t  A ,

4

where (t-) is the left hand limit of  at t  [-r, 0]. Assumptions (A3) and (A4) are clearly satised if we choose  according to (3), but  would not induce a càdlàg functional D  D~ . This can be seen by considering the mapping [0, ) t  (t) for a function   D which is constant except for a single discontinuity. If we had dened  with the set A being the union of only nitely many sets AM , then we would have obtained a càdlàg
functional.
We consider control problems in the weak formulation (cf. Yong and Zhou, 1999: p. 64).
Given an admissible control u(.) and a deterministic initial segment   D0, denote by X ,u the unique solution to equation (1). Let I be a compact interval with non-empty interior. Dene the stopping time T¯,u of rst exit from the interior of I before time T¯ > 0
by

(4) T¯,u := inf{t  0 | X,u(t) / int(I)}  T¯.

In order to dene the costs, we prescribe a cost rate k : R ×   [0, ) and a boundary cost g : R  [0, ) which we take to be (jointly) continuous bounded functions. Let   0 denote the exponential discount rate. Then dene the cost functional on D0 × Uad by



(5)

J(, u) := E

exp(-s) · k X,u(s), u(s) ds + g X,u( ) ,

0

where  = T¯,u. Our aim is to minimize J (, .). We introduce the value function

(6) V () := inf{J (, u) | u  Uad},   D0.

The control problem now consists in calculating the function V and nding admissible controls that minimize J . Such control processes are called optimal controls or optimal strategies.

3 Existence of optimal strategies
In the class Uad of admissible controls it may happen that there is no optimal control
(Kushner and Dupuis, 2001: p. 86). A way out is to enlarge the class of controls, allowing for so-called relaxed controls, so that the existence of an optimal (relaxed) control is guaranteed, while the inmum of the costs over the new class coincides with the value function
V as given by (6). A deterministic relaxed control is a positive measure  on B( × [0, )), the Borel
-algebra on  × [0, ), such that
(7) ( × [0, t]) = t for all t  0.
For each G  B(), the function t  (G × [0, t]) is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure on [0, ) by virtue of property (7). Denote by (., G) any Lebesgue

5

density of (G × [0, .]). The family of densities (., G), G  B(), can be chosen in a Borel measurable way such that (t, .) is a probability measure on B() for each t  0, and



(B) =

1{(,t)B} (t, d) dt for all B  B( × [0, )).

0

Denote by R the space of deterministic relaxed controls which is equipped with the weakcompact topology induced by the following notion of convergence: a sequence (n)nN of relaxed controls converges to   R if and only if

g(, t) dn(, t) n-

g(, t) d(, t) for all g  Cc( × [0, )),

×[0,)

×[0,)

where Cc(×[0, )) is the space of all real-valued continuous functions on ×[0, ) having compact support. Under the weak-compact topology, R is a (sequentially) compact space.
Suppose (n)nN is a convergent sequence in R with limit . Given T > 0, let n|T denote the restriction of n to the Borel -algebra on  × [0, T ], and denote by |T the restriction of  to B( × [0, T ]). Then n|T , n  N, |T are all nite measures and (n|T ) converges weakly to |T .
A relaxed control process is an R-valued random variable R such that the mapping   R( × [0, t])() is Ft-measurable for all t  0, G  B(). For a relaxed control process R equation (1) takes on the form

(8)

dX(t) =

b(Xt, ) R (t, d) dt + (Xt) dW (t), t  0,



where (R (t, .))t0 is the family of derivative measures associated with R. The family (R (t, .)) can be constructed in a measurable way (cf. Kushner, 1990: p. 52). A relaxed
control process together with its stochastic basis including the Wiener process is called
admissible relaxed control if, for every deterministic initial condition, equation (8) has a unique solution which is also weakly unique. Any ordinary control process u can be
represented as a relaxed control process by setting



R(B) :=

1{(,t)B} u(t)(d) dt, B  B( × [0, )),

0

where  is the Dirac measure at   . Denote by U^ad the set of all admissible relaxed controls. Instead of (5) we dene a cost
functional on D0 × U^ad by



(9) J^(, R) := E

exp(-s) · k X,R(s),  R (s, d) ds + g X,R( ) ,

0

where X ,R is the solution to equation (8) with initial segment  and  is dened in
analogy to (4). Instead of (6) as value function we have

(10) V^ () := inf{J^(, R) | R  U^ad},   D0.

6

The cost functional J^ depends only on the joint distribution of the solution X ,R and the underlying control process R, since  , the time horizon, is a deterministic function of the solution. The distribution of X ,R, in turn, is determined by the initial condition  and
the joint distribution of the control process and its accompanying Wiener process. Letting
the time horizon vary, we may regard J^ as a function of the law of (X, R, W,  ), that is, as being dened on a subset of the set of probability measures on B(D × R × D~  × [0, ]). The domain of denition of J^ is determined by the class of admissible relaxed controls for
equation (8), the denition of the time horizon and the distributions of the initial segments
X0. The idea in proving existence of an optimal strategy is to check that J^(, .) is a (se-
quentially) lower semi-continuous function dened on a (sequentially) compact set. It then
follows from a theorem by Weierstraÿ that J^(, .) attains its minimum at some point of
its compact domain (cf. Yong and Zhou, 1999: p. 65). The following proposition gives the
analogue of Theorem 10.1.1 in Kushner and Dupuis (2001: pp. 271-275) for our setting. We
present the proof in detail, because the identication of the limit process is dierent from
the classical case.
Proposition 1. Assume (A1)  (A4). Let ((RM , W M ))MN be any sequence of admissible relaxed controls for equation (8), where (RM , W M ) is dened on the ltered probability space (M , F M , (FtM ), PM ). Let XM be a solution to equation (8) under control (RM , W M ) with deterministic initial condition M  D0, and assume that (M ) tends to  uniformly for some   D0. For each M  N, let  M be an (FtM )-stopping time. Then ((XM , RM , W M ,  M ))MN is tight.
Denote by (X, R, W,  ) a limit point of the sequence ((XM , RM , W M ,  M ))MN. Dene a ltration by Ft := (X(s), R(s), W (s),  1{t}, s  t), t  0. Then W (.) is an (Ft)adapted Wiener process,  is an (Ft)-stopping time, (R, W ) is an admissible relaxed control, and X is a solution to (8) under (R, W ) with initial condition .
Proof. Tightness of (X M ) follows from the Aldous criterion (cf. Billingsley, 1999: pp. 176179): given M  N, any bounded (FtM )-stopping time  and  > 0 we have
EM XM ( + ) - XM () 2 FM  2K2( + 1)
as a consequence of Assumption (A3) and the Itô isometry. Notice that X M (0) tends to X (0) as M goes to innity by hypothesis. The sequences (RM ) and ( M ) are tight, because the value spaces R and [0, ], respectively, are compact. The sequence (W M ) is tight, since all W M induce the same measure. Finally, componentwise tightness implies
tightness of the product (cf. Billingsley, 1999: p. 65).
By abuse of notation, we do not distinguish between the convergent subsequence and
the original sequence and we assume that ((X M , RM , W M ,  M )) converges weakly to (X, R, W,  ). The random time  is an (Ft)-stopping time by construction of the ltration. Likewise, R is (Ft)-adapted by construction, and it is indeed a relaxed control process,
7

because R( × [0, t]) = t, t  0, P-almost surely by weak convergence of the relaxed control processes (RM ) to R. The process W has Wiener distribution and continuous paths with probability one, being the limit of standard Wiener processes. To check that W is an (Ft)-Wiener process, we use the martingale problem characterization of Brownian motion. To this end, for g  Cc( × [0, )),   R dene the pairing

(g, )(t) :=

g(, s) d(, s), t  0.

×[0,t]

Notice that real-valued continuous functions on R can be approximated by functions of

the form

R   H~ (gj, )(ti), (i, j)  Np × Nq  R,

where p, q are natural numbers, {ti | i  Np}  [0, ), and H~ , gj , j  Nq, are suitable continuous functions with compact support and NN := {1, . . . , N } for any N  N. Let t  0, t1, . . . , tp  [0, t], h  0, g1, . . . , gq be functions in Cc( × [0, )), and H be a continuous function of 2p + p · q + 1 arguments with compact support. Since W M is an (FtM )-Wiener process for each M  N, we have for all f  Cc2(R)

EM H XM (ti), (gj, RM )(ti), W M (ti),  M 1{M t}, (i, j)  Np × Nq

t+h

· f W M (t + h) - f W M (t) - 1 2

By the weak convergence of ((X M , RM , W M ,  M ))MN to (X, W, R,  ) we see that

E H X(ti), (gj, R)(ti), W (ti),  1{t}, (i, j)  Np × Nq

t+h

· f W (t + h) - f W (t) - 1 2

2f x2 W (s) ds

for all f  Cc2(R). As H , p, q, ti, gj vary over all possibilities, the corresponding random variables H(X(ti), (gj , R)(ti), W (ti),  1{ t}, (i, j)  Np × Nq) induce the -algebra Ft. Since t  0, h  0 were arbitrary, it follows that

t

f W (t) - f W (0) - 1 2

2f x2 W (s) ds,

is an (Ft)-martingale for every f  Cc2(R). Consequently, W is an (Ft)-Wiener process. It remains to show that X solves equation (8) under control (R, W ) with initial condi-
tion . Notice that X has continuous paths on [0, ) P-almost surely, because the process (X (t))t0 is the weak limit in D~  of continuous processes. Fix T > 0. We have to check that P-almost surely

By virtue of the Skorohod representation theorem (cf. Billingsley, 1999: p. 70) we may
assume that the processes (X M , RM , W M ), M  N, are all dened on the same probability space (, F , P) as (X, R, W ) and that convergence of ((XM , RM , W M )) to (X, R, W ) is P -almost sure. Since X , W have continuous paths on [0, T ] and (M ) converges to  in the uniform topology, one nds ~  F with P(~ ) = 1 such that for all   ~

sup XM (t)() - X(t)() M- 0, sup W M (t)() - W (t)() M- 0,

t[-r,T ]

t[-r,T ]

and also RM ()  R() in R. Let   ~ . We rst show that

t b XsM (),  R M (s, d)() ds M- t b Xs(),  R (s, d)() ds

uniformly in t  [0, T ]. As a consequence of Assumption (A4), the uniform convergence of the trajectories on [-r, T ] and property (7) of the relaxed controls, we have

b XsM (),  - b Xs(),  dRM (, s)() M 0.
×[0,T ]
By Assumption (A2), we nd a countable set A  [0, T ] such that the mapping (, s)  b(Xs(), ) is continuous in all (, s)   × ([0, T ] \ A). Since A is countable we have R()(×A ) = 0. Hence, by the generalized mapping theorem (cf. Billingsley, 1999: p. 21), we obtain for each t  [0, T ]

b Xs(),  dRM (, s)() M

b Xs(),  dR(, s)().

×[0,t]

×[0,t]

The convergence is again uniform in t  [0, T ], as b is bounded and RM , M  N, R are all positive measures with mass T on  × [0, T ]. Let us dene càdlàg processes CM , M  N, on [0, ) by

CM (t) := M (0) +

b(XsM , ) dRM (, s), t  0,

×[0,t]

and dene C in analogy to C M with , R, X in place of M , RM , X M , respectively. We already know that CM (t)  C(t) holds uniformly over t  [0, T ] for any T > 0 with probability one. Dene operators F M : D~   D~ , M  N, mapping càdlàg processes to
càdlàg processes by





F M (Y )(t)() :=  [-r, 0]

Y (t+s)() if t+s  0, s  ,

t  0,   ,

M (t+s) else

and dene F in the same way as F M with M replaced by . Observe that X M solves
t
XM (t) = CM (t) + F M (XM )(s-) dW M (s), t  0.

Denote by (X^ (t))t0 the unique solution to
t
X^ (t) = C(t) + F (X^ )(s-) dW (s), t  0,
0
and set X^ (t) := (t) for t  [-r, 0). Assumption (A4) and the uniform convergence of (M ) to  imply that F M (X^ ) converges to F (X^ ) uniformly on compacts in probability (convergence in ucp). Theorem V.15 in Protter (2003: p. 265) asserts that (X M ) converges to X^ in ucp, that is
sup XM (t) - X^ (t) M- 0 in probability P for any T > 0.
t[0,T ]
Therefore, X is indistinguishable from X^ . By denition of C and F , this implies that X^ solves equation (8) under control (R, W ) with initial condition , and so does X .

If the time horizon were deterministic, then the existence of optimal strategies in the
class of relaxed controls would be clear. Given an initial condition   D0, one would select a sequence ((RM , W M ))M N such that (J^(, RM )) converges to its inmum. By Proposition 1, a suitable subsequence of ((RM , W M )) and the associated solution processes would converge weakly to (R, W ) and the associated solution to equation (8). Taking into account (9), the denition of the costs, this in turn would imply that J^(, .) attains its minimum value at R or, more precisely, (X, R, W ).
A similar argument is still valid, if the time horizon depends continuously on the paths
with probability one under every possible solution. That is to say, the mapping

(11) ^ : D  [0, ],

^() := inf{t  0 | (t) / int(I)}  T¯

is Skorohod continuous with probability one under the measure induced by any solution
X ,R, R any relaxed control. This is indeed the case if the diusion coecient  is bounded
away from zero as required by Assumption (A5), cf. Kushner and Dupuis (2001: pp. 277281).
By introducing relaxed controls, we have enlarged the class of possible strategies. The inmum of the costs, however, remains the same for the new class. This is a consequence of the fact that stochastic relaxed controls can be arbitrarily well approximated by piecewise constant ordinary stochastic controls which attain only a nite number of dierent control values. A proof of this assertion is given in Kushner (1990: pp. 59-60) in case the time horizon is nite, and extended to the case of control up to an exit time in Kushner and Dupuis (2001: pp. 282-286). Notice that nothing hinges on the presence or absence of delay in the controlled dynamics. Let us summarize our ndings.
Theorem 1. Assume (A1)  (A5). Given any deterministic initial condition   D0, the relaxed control problem determined by (8) and (9) possesses an optimal strategy, and the minimal costs are the same as for the original control problem.

4 Approximating chains

In order to construct nite-dimensional approximations to our control problem, we dis-

cretize time and state space. Denote byh > 0 the mesh size of an equidistant time discretisation starting at zero. Let Sh := hZ be the corresponding state space, and set

Ih := I  Sh. Notice that Sh is countable and Ih is nite. Let h : R  Sh be a round-

o function.

We will simplify things even further by considering only mesh sizes h =

r M

for some M  N, where r is the delay length. The number M will be referred to as

discretisation degree.

The admissible controls for the nite-dimensional control problems correspond to piece-
wise constant processes in continuous time. A time-discrete process u = (u(n))nN0 on (, F , P) with values in  is a discrete admissible control of degree M if u takes on only nitely many dierent values in  and u(n) is Fnh-measurable for all n  N0. Denote by
(u¯(t))t0 the piecewise constant càdlàg interpolation to u.
We call a time-discrete process ((n))n{-M,...,0}N on (, F , P) a discrete chain of degree M if ((n)) takes its values in Sh and (n) is Fnh-measurable for all n  N0. In analogy to u¯, write (¯(t))t-r for the càdlàg interpolation to the discrete chain ((n))n{-M,...,0}N. We denote by ¯t the D0-valued segment of ¯(.) at time t  0.
Let   D0 be a deterministic initial condition, and suppose we are given a sequence of discrete admissible controls (uM )MN, that is uM is a discrete admissible control of degree M on a stochastic basis (M , F M , (FtM ), PM ) for each M  N. In addition, suppose that the sequence (u¯M ) of interpolated discrete controls converges weakly to some relaxed
control R. We are then looking for a sequence approximating the solution X of equation (8)
under control (R, W ) with initial condition , where the Wiener process W has to be

constructed from the approximating sequence.

Given M -step or extended Markov transition functions pM : ShM+1 ×  × Sh  [0, 1], M  N, we dene a sequence of approximating chains associated with  and (uM ) as a

family (M )M N of processes such that M is a discrete chain of degree M dened on the

same stochastic basis as uM , provided the following conditions are fullled for h

PM M (n+1) = x FnMh = pM M (n-M ), . . . , M (n), uM (n), x .

(iii) Local consistency with the drift coecient:
µM (n) := EM M (n+1) - M (n) FnMh = h · b ¯nMh, uM (n) + o(h) =: h · bh ¯nMh, uM (n) .

(iv) Local consistency with the diusion coecient:
EM M (n+1) - M (n) - µM (n) 2 FnMh = h · 2(¯nMh) + o(h) =: h · h2(¯nMh).

(v) Jump heights: there is a positive number N~ , independent of M , such that sup |M (n + 1) - M (n)|  N~ hM .
n

It is straightforward, under Assumptions (A3) and (A5), to construct a sequence of ex-

tended transition functions such that the jump height and the local consistency conditions

are fullled.
We will represent the interpolation ¯M as a solution to an equation corresponding to
equation (1) with control process u¯M and initial condition M , where M is the piecewise constant Sh-valued càdlàg interpolation to , that is M = ¯0M . Dene the discrete process (LM (n))nN0 by LM (0) := 0 and

which tends to zero as M goes to innity by Assumptions (A2), (A3), dominated convergence and the dening properties of (M ). Moreover, |1M (t)| is bounded by 2K ·T for all t  [0, T ] and all M big enough, whence also

where the error terms (2M ) converge to zero as (M1 ) before.
We are now prepared for the convergence result, which should be compared to Theorem

10.4.1 in Kushner and Dupuis (2001: p. 290). The proof is similar to that of Proposition 1.

We merely point out the main dierences.

Proposition 2. Assume (A1)  (A5). For each M  N, let  M be a stopping time with respect to the ltration generated by (¯M (s), u¯M (s), W¯ M (s), s  t). Let RM denote the relaxed control representation of u¯M . Suppose (M ) converges to the initial condition  uniformly on [-r, 0]. Then ((¯M , RM , W¯ M ,  M ))MN is tight.
For a limit point (X, R, W,  ) set Ft :=  X(s), R(s), W (s),  1{t}, s  t , t  0. Then W is an (Ft)-adapted Wiener process,  is an (Ft)-stopping time, (R, W ) is an admissible relaxed control, and X is a solution to equation (8) under (R, W ) with initial
condition .

Proof. The main dierences in the proof are establishing the tightness of (W¯ M ) and the
identication of the limit points. We calculate the order of convergence for the discrete-time
previsible quadratic variations of (W M ):

n-1

WM n =

E (W M (i+1) - W M (i))2 FiMh

i=0

n-1 1 = nh + o(h) i=0 2(~iMh )

for all M  N, n  N0. Taking into account Assumption (A5) and the denition of the time-continuous processes W¯ M , we see that W¯ M tends to Id[0,) in probability uniformly
on compact time intervals. By Theorem VIII.3.11 of Jacod and Shiryaev (1987: p. 432) we
conclude that (W¯ M ) converges weakly in D~  to a standard Wiener process W . That W has independent increments with respect to the ltration (Ft) can be seen by considering the rst and second conditional moments of the increments of W M for each M  N and applying the conditions on local consistency and the jump heights of (M ).
Suppose ((¯M , RM , W¯ M )) is weakly convergent with limit point (X, R, W ). The re-
maining dierent part is the identication of X as a solution to equation (8) under the
relaxed control (R, W ) with initial condition . Notice that X is continuous on [0, ) because of the condition on the jump heights of (M ), cf. Theorem 3.10.2 in Ethier and Kurtz (1986: p. 148). Let us dene càdlàg processes C M , C on [0, ) by

t
CM (t) := M (0) + b ¯sM , u¯M (s) ds + M2 (t),
0

C(t) := (0) +

b(Xs, ) dR(s, ),

×[0,t]

t  0, t  0.

13

Notice that C , C M are bounded on compact time intervals uniformly in M  N. Invoking Skorohod's representation theorem, one establishes weak convergence of (C M ) to C as in

the proof of Proposition 1.
The sequence (W¯ M ) is of uniformly controlled variations, hence a good sequence of in-

tegrators in the sense of Kurtz and Protter (1991), because the jump heights are uniformly
bounded and W¯ M is a martingale for each M  N. We have weak convergence of (W¯ M )

to W . The results in Kurtz and Protter (1991) guarantee weak convergence of the corresponding adapted quadratic variation processes, that is ([W¯ M , W¯ M ]) converges weakly to [W, W ] in D~  = DR([0, )) where the square brackets indicate the adapted quadratic (co-)variation. Convergence also holds for the sequence of process pairs (W¯ M , [W¯ M , W¯ M ])

in DR2 ([0, )), see Theorem 36 in Kurtz and Protter (2004). We now know that each of the sequences (¯M ), (CM ), (W¯ M ), [W¯ M , W¯ M ] is weakly

convergent in DR([0, )). Actually, we have weak convergence for the sequence of process quadruples (¯M , CM , W¯ M , [W¯ M , W¯ M ]) in DR4 ([0, )). To see this notice that each of the sequences (¯M + CM ), (¯M + W¯ M ), (¯M + [W¯ M , W¯ M ]), (CM + W¯ M ), (CM + [W¯ M , W¯ M ]), and (W¯ M + [W¯ M , W¯ M ]) is tight in DR([0, )), because the limit processes C, X , W , and
[W, W ] = I d[0,) are all continuous on [0, ). According to Problem 22 in Ethier and
Kurtz (1986: p. 153) this implies tightness of the quadruple sequence in DR4 ([0, )). Since

the four component sequences are all weakly convergent, the four-dimensional sequence

must have a unique limit point, namely (X, C, W, [W, W ]). By virtue of Skorohod's the-

orem, we may again work under P-almost sure convergence. Since C , X , W , [W, W ] are all continuous, it follows that CM  C, ¯M  X, W¯ M  W , [W¯ M , W¯ M ]  [W, W ]

uniformly on compact subintervals of [0, ) with probability one. Dene the mapping F : D0 × D~   D~  by

F (, x)(t) :=  [-r, 0] s

(t+s) else

For M  N, let F M be the mapping from D~  to D~  given by F M (x) := F (M , x). Let

H M : D~   D~  be the càdlàg interpolation operator of degree M , that is H M (x) is the

If   D, we will take F M (), F¯M () and F () to equal F M (x),

F¯M (x) and F (, x), respectively, where x is the restriction of  to [0, ). Equation (12)

translates to

Fix T > 0. Since ¯M converges to X as M goes to innity uniformly on compacts with
probability one, it is enough to show that
() E sup ^(t) - ¯M (t) 2 M- 0.
t[-r,T ]

First observe that

E sup C(t) - CM (t) 2
t[0,T ]

M- 0,

sup ^(t) - ¯M (t) 2 M- 0,
t[-r,0)

because C is uniformly bounded on compact time intervals and  is càdlàg and continuous

on [-r, 0). Given  > 0, by Lemma 1 in the Appendix and by Gronwall's lemma we nd

that there is a positive number M0 = M0() such that for all M  M0

E sup

t F¯M (¯M )(s-)dW¯ M (s) 2

t[0,T ] 0

0

This yields () and the assertion follows.

If we consider approximations along all equidistant partitions of [-r, 0], then the hypothesis about the uniform convergence of the initial conditions implies that  must be continuous on [-r, 0] \ {0}. In the case that  has jumps at positions located on one par-
tition, the convergence results continue to hold when we restrict to a sequence of rening partitions.

5 Convergence of the minimal costs

The objective behind the introduction of sequences of approximating chains was to obtain
a device for approximating the value function V of the original problem. The idea now is to dene, for each discretisation degree M  N, a discrete control problem with cost functional J M so that J M is an approximation of the cost functional J of the original problem in the following sense: Given a suitable initial segment   D0 and a sequence of discrete admissible controls (uM ) such that (u¯M ) weakly converges to a relaxed control R, we have J M (, uM )  J^(, R) as M tends to innity. Under the assumptions introduced above,

it will follow that also the value functions associated with the discrete cost functionals

converge to the value function of the original problem.

Fix M

 N, and let h :=

r M

.

Denote by UaMd

the set of discrete admissible controls of

degree M . Dene the cost functional of degree M by

Nh-1

(13)

JM , u := E

exp(-nh) · k (n), u(n) · h + g (Nh) ,

n=0

where   D0, u  UaMd is dened on the stochastic basis (, F , (Ft), P) and ((n)) is a discrete chain of degree M dened according to pM and u with initial condition . The
discrete exit time step Nh is given by

(14)

Nh := min{n  N0 | (n) / Ih} 

T¯ h

.

15

Denote by ¯M := h · Nh the exit time for the corresponding interpolated processes. The value function of degree M is dened as
(15) V M () := inf J , u u  UaMd ,   D0.

We are now in a position to state the result about convergence of the minimal costs.
Proposition 3 and Theorem 2 are comparable to Theorems 10.5.1 and 10.5.2 in Kushner
and Dupuis (2001: pp. 292-295). Let us suppose that the initial condition   D0 and the sequence of partitions of [-r, 0] are such that the discretized initial conditions converge to  uniformly on [-r, 0].

Proposition 3. Assume (A1)  (A5). If the sequence (¯M , u¯M , W¯ M , ¯M ) of interpolated

processes converges weakly to a limit point (X, R, W,  ), then X is a solution to equation (8)

under relaxed control (R, W ) with initial condition ,  is the exit time for X as given by

(4), and we have

J M (, uM ) M- J^(, R).

Proof. The convergence assertion for the costs is a consequence of Proposition 2, the fact
that, by virtue of Assumption (A5), the exit time ^ dened in (11) is Skorohod-continuous, and the denition of J M and J (or J^).

Theorem 2. Assume (A1)  (A5). Then we have limM V M () = V ().
Proof. First notice that lim inf M  V M ()  V () as a consequence of Propositions 2 and 3. In order to show lim supM  V M ()  V () choose a relaxed control (R, W ) so that J^(, R) = V () according to Proposition 1. Given  > 0, one can construct a sequence of discrete admissible controls (uM ) such that ((¯M , u¯M , W¯ M , ¯M )) is weakly convergent, where (¯M ), (W¯ M ), (¯M ) are constructed as above, and

lim sup |JM (, uM ) - J^(, R)|  .
M 
The existence of such a sequence of discrete admissible controls is guaranteed, cf. the
discussion at the end of Section 3. By denition, V M ()  J M (, uM ) for each M  N.
Using Proposition 3 we nd that

lim sup V M ()  lim sup JM (, uM )  V () + ,

M 

M 

and since  was arbitrary, the assertion follows.

Appendix
The proof of the following lemma makes use of standard techniques. In the context of approximation of SDDEs, it should be compared to Section 7 in Mao (2003).

Let x, y  D~ . By Assumption (A4) we have for all t  [0, T ]

 KL · sup N (s) - (s) + KL · sup HN (y)(s) - x(s)

s[-r,0)

s[0,T ]

+ F (, x) t N - F (, x)(t) .

By Assumption (A1), the map [0, T ] t  F (, x)(t) is càdlàg, whence it has only nitely many jumps larger than any given positive lower bound. Thus, given  > 0, there is a nite subset A = A(, T , , x)  [0, T ] such that

lim sup F (, x) t N - F (, x)(t)   for all t  [0, T ] \ A.
N 
Moreover, the convergence is uniform in the following sense (cf. Billingsley, 1999): We can
choose the nite set A in such a way that there is N0 = N0(, T , , x)  N so that

F (, x) t N - F (, x)(t)  2 for all t  [0, T ] \ A, N  N0.
Given  > 0, we therefore nd N  N and an event ~ with P(~ )  1 -  so that for each   ~ there is a nite subset A  [0, T ] with #A  N  and such that for all t  [0, T ] \ A and all M  N we have
F¯M ¯M () (t) - F X() (t) 2 + F¯N ¯M () (t) - F X() (t) 2  .

The expression on the right hand side of (19) is then bounded from above by 9T (K 2 + 1). For M big enough, also the expression on the right hand side of (20) is smaller than 9T (K2 + 1), and the expectation in (21) is smaller than T .
