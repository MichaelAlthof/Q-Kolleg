Abstract We reconsider the canonical model of price setting with menu costs by Ball and Romer (1990). Their original model exhibits multiple equilibria for nominal aggregate demand shocks of intermediate size. By abandoning Ball and Romer's (1990) assumption that demand shocks are common knowledge among price setters, we derive a unique symmetric threshold equilibrium where agents adjust prices whenever the demand shock falls outside the thresholds. The comparative statics of this threshold may differ from the one that gives rise to maximal nominal rigidity examined by Ball and Romer (1990). In contrast to their analysis, we find that a decrease in real rigidities can be associated with an increase in nominal rigidities due to the endogenous adjustment of agents' beliefs regarding the aggregate price level.

1. Introduction
Price setting with fixed costs to adjustment (menu costs) and strategic complementarities in firms' pricing decisions may give rise to multiple equilibria. Ball and Romer (1990) (henceforth BR) show that monopolistically competitive firms find it more attractive to incur

menu costs and adjust their prices in response to aggregate demand shocks if other firms do so as well. Two equilibria, sustained by self-fulfilling beliefs, may emerge. In one, all firms adjust prices, while in the other, prices are rigid. We derive a unique threshold equilibrium in BR's model by exploiting ideas from the literature on global games.1 The equilibrium is such that firms pay the menu cost and adjust their price if and only if the magnitude of the shock exceeds a certain threshold. In their original analysis, BR derive upper and lower bounds for the shock such that multiple equilibria emerge for shocks within these bounds. The equilibrium threshold in our version equals the midpoint of these bounds.
At first glance this seems to strengthen BR's conclusion that the existence of large monetary nonneutralities in a standard representative agent model with menu costs requires implausible values of standard parameters. However, the threshold we derive implies different comparative statics than those presented by BR. More specifically, BR examine only the comparative statics of the upper bound on the region of multiplicity and neglect how price setters' beliefs about the behavior of other price setters adjust in equilibrium. In contrast, we endogenize price setters' beliefs by endowing them with noisy private information regarding the nominal aggregate demand shock and explicitly confining attention to symmetric threshold strategies, i.e., strategies such that agents adjust if and only if their signals exceed a common threshold. We then show that in the limit when information regarding the shock becomes arbitrarily precise, a price setter who is just indifferent between adjusting and not adjusting believes that half of the agents adjust while the remaining half does not. Our comparative statics then reflect the adjustment of beliefs and we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for them to differ qualitatively from BR's original conclusions.
BR's main focus is the role of real rigidities, i.e., forces that render price setters reluctant to fully adjust their relative prices to a change in aggregate demand, in explaining monetary nonneutralities. When price setters' objective functions are very concave in their relative prices, a unilateral price change by one agent is rather costly (in utility terms) and

real rigidities are high. This implies agents are more inclined to adjust when others adjust in order to keep relative prices stable. Thus, pricing decisions are also characterized by a high degree of strategic complementarities highlighting that real rigidities and strategic complementarities are closely interlinked.2 Moreover, when menu costs are present, the gain from price adjustment may fall short of the menu cost, implying that it may be optimal to forgo the adjustment. In particular when real rigidities are large, there is a range of shocks where an agent gains from adjusting only if sufficiently many others adjust as well. This is the range of shocks where multiple equilibria, sustained by self-fulfilling beliefs regarding the behavior of others, may occur.
Multiplicity of equilibrium, however, is driven by the indeterminacy of price setters' beliefs. In the literature on global games, such an indeterminacy is seen as resulting from agents sharing common knowledge about the model's fundamentals and each being perfectly aware of what the others do in equilibrium.3 This implies that agents' actions and beliefs are perfectly coordinated in equilibrium and thus equilibrium multiplicity occurs.4 To eliminate this multiplicity, the global games approach, pioneered by Carlsson and van Damme (1993), abandons common knowledge about the economy's fundamental and instead endows agents with idiosyncratic noisy signals. We adopt a similar approach to derive a unique equilibrium in BR's model.5 In the limiting case with uncertainty regarding the fundamental eliminated, agents' beliefs are still subject to strategic uncertainty breaking the perfect coordination of actions and beliefs and eliminating the equilibrium multiplicity of BR's original analysis.
This further implies that the comparative statics in our version may differ from those of BR. Consider a situation where, for some reason, a price setter's optimality condition becomes less sensitive to changes relative prices and at the same time only slightly less sen-

sitive to variations in aggregate demand. This is tantamount to a decrease in real rigidities. In BR's analysis, this implies that the agent will focus relatively more on her response to aggregate demand given that her beliefs regarding the aggregate price level are assumed to remain unchanged, rendering her more inclined to adjust her price. Thus, the decrease in real rigidities implies a decrease in nominal rigidities. This reasoning is, however, incomplete as it neglects an important effect. If real rigidities decrease, price setters are not only more inclined to adjust their prices in response to large shocks even if others do not, but they are also more inclined to tolerate other agents' price adjustments in response to small shocks. Whether a shock is large or small from the point of view of the agent depends on how sensitive her utility function is to the shock in equilibrium. Thus, coming back to the example above, since the agent became much less sensitive to relative prices than to variations in demand, she is more strongly inclined to tolerate price adjustments by others for a shock of a given magnitude. Therefore she may be more reluctant to adjust her price and, as a consequence, the reduction in real rigidities may be associated with a higher degree of nominal rigidities.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the basic BR framework and shows the existence of multiple equilibria. Section 3 presents our unique threshold equilibrium and a general comparative statics result. Section 4 provides a numerical illustration in BR's baseline model of monopolistic competition. Section 5 concludes. All mathematical proofs and calculations are relegated to the Appendix.

2. Ball and Romer (1990): Multiple Equilibria

BR consider a canonical model of price setting. A representative price setter produces a differentiated good with her own labor and faces fixed costs to price adjustment. Her utility is given by

Ui = W

z is the menu

cost--a small resource cost of changing a nominal price; Di is equal to one if agent i changes

her price and zero otherwise.

Assuming a quantity theory approach to expenditures,

M Y= P where M is the nominal money supply,6 it follows in equilibrium

BR assume W2(1, 1) = 0, W22(1, 1) < 0, and W12(1, 1) > 0, which, in turn, normalizes the optimal relative price to unity, implies that the second order condition is satisfied at this price, and that the equilibrium is stable.
The optimal price is governed by the first-order condition

A first order expansion in log deviations from a symmetric equilibrium Pi = P = M yields

P C(m, p, pi ) =. W em-p, e pi p - W em-p, e-p  -W22(1, 1) pi 2

(7)

We are now in a position to assess the range of monetary deviations, m, for which rigidity, pi = p = 0, and adjustment, pi = p = pi , are equilibrium. Note that even if no other agents adjust their prices, agent i always adjusts her price if

Agent i's optimal price in this case is pi = m. Combining this with the latter inequality yields a threshold value

implying that all agents consider adjustment their dominant choice whenever |m| > x and

consequently, adjustment is the only equilibrium.

Conversely, suppose that all agents adjust their prices, i.e. p = m. Even then, agent i

does not adjust her price if

PC(m, m, pi ) < z

This yields another threshold value

x =

-W22(1, 1)

(10)

implying that if |m| < x, not adjusting is dominant for all agents and rigidity is the only

equilibrium. However, as   (0, 1) and x < x, there exists multiple equilibria for interme-

diate monetary deviations. This partition of equilibria is displayed in figure 1.

Proposition 1. Full Information Thresholds For large monetary deviations, |m| > x, a unique equilibrium exists where all agents adjust prices. For small monetary deviations, |m| < x, a unique equilibrium exists where no agent adjusts her price. For intermediate deviations x < |m| < x both, adjustment and rigidity can be sustained as (self-fulfilling) equilibria.
Proof. See BR.

3. Unique Threshold Equilibrium
The multiplicity of equilibria is due to the indeterminacy of price setters' beliefs, which follows from assuming that monetary deviations are common knowledge among agents and that agents are perfectly coordinated in equilibrium.8 This multiplicity prohibits the derivation of general comparative statics. BR nonetheless examine the comparative statics of the x threshold, ignoring the effects of multiplicity.
To obtain a unique equilibrium and valid set of comparative statics, we assume that m is drawn from a uniform distribution over the real line. This "improper prior" assumption is often made in the literature on global games. Since we confine attention to posterior conditional distributions, it does not present any technical difficulties.9 The realization of m is not common knowledge but agents observe private signals concerning its realization. These signals take the form

xi = m + i, with i  N (0, ), i.i.d.

We confine ourselves to symmetric threshold strategies. A threshold strategy for agent i can be described by a value x~ i such that agent i adjusts if and only if |xi| > x~ i. A symmetric threshold strategy is simply described by a common threshold for all agents, x~ i = x~ j = x~. We then look for symmetric equilibria in threshold strategies. Such a threshold strategy for agent i is depicted in figure 2. In order to derive the equilibrium threshold, we exploit the indifference of an agent between adjusting and not adjusting when she observes xi = x~ and believes that other agents also use the threshold x~.

Proposition 2. Unique Threshold Equilibrium As fundamental uncertainty regarding the size of the monetary shocks vanishes,   0, there exists a unique threshold, x~, such that all agents adjust if and only if |xi| < x~ and refrain from adjusting otherwise. The threshold is given by

x + x x~ =
2

(12)

Proof. See Appendix A.2.

To understand the intuition behind proposition 2, consider the equilibrium beliefs under the resulting threshold equilibrium as displayed in figure 3. Now imagine the model with a very small amount of uncertainty regarding the fundamental. An agent's belief is a random variable whose distribution is centered on the signal she receives. As  is small, for signals far enough away from the thresholds, x~ and -x~, the distribution of beliefs will place essentially no mass past the threshold. As fundamental uncertainty vanishes, these distributions collapse and coordination will occur as long as m = x~. That is, an agent expects that others receive almost exactly the same signal as she does and therefore she expects the aggregate price level to equal her signal. However, whenever she receives a signal equal to either threshold, the distribution is split into two half: one to the left and one to the right of the threshold. In other words, the distribution collapses to a point mass divided evenly between rigidity and adjustment. With agents coordinating their beliefs and actions on half of the agents adjusting and half not, the resulting aggregate price level becomes exactly

8

the average of what it would be with an infinitesimally larger or smaller monetary shock. The threshold, then, that splits beliefs half to adjustment and half to rigidity and leaves the agent indifferent to both choices is the average of the thresholds with beliefs wholly coordinated either to adjustment or rigidity.

[Figure 3 about here.]

A direct consequence of propositions 1 and 2 is x~ < x or that the unique threshold equilibrium is associated with less nominal rigidity than the x threshold examined by BR would imply. This is not surprising as BR themselves point out that they examine the region with the largest possible nominal rigidities. The crucial question is whether the comparative statics of the x~ and x thresholds differ. Without loss of generality, suppose that the function W(·, ·) depends on a finite number of parameters denoted by k, k = 1, . . ., I. The following proposition provides necessary and sufficient conditions under which the comparative statics of the threshold x are different from those of x~.

Proposition 3. Comparative Statics

For marginal changes in parameters k, denoted dk, k = 1, . . ., I, the threshold x~ is increasing and x decreasing if and only if

Proof. See Appendix A.3.

To interpret this result, recall that the equilibrium thresholds are defined as the critical signals that render an agent indifferent between adjusting and not adjusting given that she either believes no other agent adjusts (the BR threshold x) or that other agents use the same threshold strategy as she does (our threshold x~). What we are after is understanding

9

when the two thresholds, x and x~, have different comparative statics. Indifference entails that the agent's payoff difference, under either threshold x or x~, equals the menu cost z. Then, if parameter variations increase one of these payoff differences and decrease the other, the former threshold will fall and the latter will rise. Differentiating the payoff difference gives (which is valid for either threshold),

dPC = p 2 (-W22) dp - pdW22

(15)

Since the optimal prices under either threshold are identical, i.e.,

p|x = x =

2 1+

x~

=

p|x~ , the signs of the differentials will be different if

2 (-W22) dp - pdW22

(16)

have different signs under the two thresholds in question. Note that all terms in the last equation are independent of the thresholds except for dp. Hence, the important question is how the optimal prices p|x and p|x~ change. Given any signal xi, we can write

dp = xid - E [p|xi] d + 1 -  dE [p|xi]

(17)

where we abbreviate d =

I i=1

and

dW22

At the threshold x, given BR's implicit assumption that E [p|xi] = dE [p|xi] = 0,

dp x = xd

d p x~ = (x~ - E[p]) d + 1 -  dE[p] =

(19)

From equations (18) and (19) follows that |d p|x~ | < |d p|x |. This implies that there exists a range of values for d such that

2 (-W22) d p x - pi dW22 > 0 but 2 (-W22) d p x~ - pi dW22 < 0.

Using

the

for

dW21 + dW22 , it is straightforward to show that the

parameter restrictions under which the above two inequalitites hold simultaneously are

those provided in Proposition 3.

The reason is that BR ignore how the expected aggregate price level adjusts to changes

in parameters and maintain that the expected aggregate price level equals zero. In our

version, the expected aggregate price level is not assumed equal zero and agents take into

account how it is affected by parameter variations. This can be seen from expression (17),

where the second term in brackets measures the effect of parameter changes on an agent's

response to her beliefs regarding the aggregate response of agents and the third component

measures how her beliefs themselves respond to these parameter changes. In contrast to

BR this also entails that we may find certain combinations of parameter changes which

induce, say, a reduction in the degree of real rigidities, but at the same time are associated

with a higher degree of nominal rigidities: For example, whenever parameter variations

reduce agents' sensitivity towards the shock by less than their sensitivity towards changes

in relative prices, they may accept variations in relative prices for a larger range of monetary

shocks. Since this holds true for all agents, the aggregate price becomes smaller, thus further

reducing agents' incentives to adjust their price. As a consequence, the change in any agent's

optimal price is smaller and the gains from adjusting the price may fall short of the menu

costs.

Here we consider BR's baseline model of monopolistically competitive yeoman farmers

who produce differentiated goods and follow BR closely in presentation and notation. There

exists a unit mass of ex ante identical agents. Agent i produces her good, Yi, with the

captures the degree of increasing marginal disutility to labor.

4.2. Numerical Results

BR consider a numerical experiment by asking how big the menu costs would need to be to just render rigidity an equilibrium given that a 5% monetary shock occurs. That is, we set x = 0.05 and solve for the associated z from the indifference condition (10) to recover the values reported by BR. In a similar way, we then set x~ = 0.05 to recover the menu costs that correspond to our threshold equilibrium reported in (12). We compare the different menu costs for different values of the markup implied by the substitution elasticity, , and the labor supply elasticity that follows from ; reporting both values for the menu costs as well as their ratio.

[Table 1 about here.]

The results are presented in Table 1. Firstly, observe that for rigidity to be an equilibrium, the menu costs needed under the threshold x~ are always higher than those reported by BR. This is a direct consequence of Proposition 2 since the threshold x~ equals the average of x and x, thus x~ < x. Hence, for a given monetary shock (here 5%), a larger menu cost is required to render agents indifferent under the x~-threshold compared to the BR-equilibrium.

12

Secondly, with small markups and inelastic labor supply, the menu costs required by the x~-equilibrium is 8.66 percent of revenue or 3.65 times larger than those in BR. Increasing the elasticity of labor supply or the markup reduces the required menu costs. Increasing the elasticity of labor supply, however, reduces the menu costs required by the BR-equilibrium relatively more than under the x~-equilibrium, leading the latter to increase slightly relative to the former. This relationship is reversed when markups are increased. If we do this, the menu costs under the x~-equilibrium decline so much more quickly than under the BRequilibrium that their ratio falls by roughly one half.
4.3. Comparative Statics We now turn to the comparative statics of the model. The results in table 1 seem to
indicate that increases in the markup and/or the elasticity of labor supply increase nominal rigidity associated with both the x threshold studied by BR and the x~ threshold that we introduce. This is misleading. A simultaneous increase in the one and decrease in the other parameter of appropriate magnitude will move the two thresholds in opposite directions.
[Figure 4 about here.]
Tracing contours in the thresholds, figure 4 outlines the nonlinear region of parameter changes, starting from a 15% markup and labor supply elasticity of 0.15 and z such that x~ = 0.05, associated with the two thresholds moving in opposite directions. The bounds in proposition 3 give the slopes of these contours at the point associated with the 15% markup and labor supply elasticity of 0.15 and the points in the figure correspond to the pairs of markups and labor supply elasticities considered in table 2. Note that the points are located inside the black curves, which trace out parameter combinations that leave the thresholds unchanged. Movements towards the northeast imply increases in both thresholds, holding the menu costs fixed.
[Table 2 about here.]
13

For example, increasing the markup from 5% to 100% while simultaneously decreasing the elasticity of labor supply leads the x threshold to decrease as the menu costs in the table required to leave an agent indifferent to a 5% monetary shock are increasing. This implies that nominal rigidity is decreasing. However, x~ is rising as the menu costs that lead to indifference are falling, implying that nominal rigidity is actually increasing. Notice that , inversely related to the degree of nominal rigidity or strategic complementarities, is increasing here. Thus, BR's x threshold has nominal and real rigidities moving moving in concert, whereas our x~ threshold has the two types of rigidity moving in opposite directions.
This difference in the movements of x and x~ can be understood as follows. A large increase in the markup and small decrease in the elasticity of labor supply leads to a substantial decrease in the concavity of the agent's utility function with respect to her relative price, -W22, but only a mild decrease in the sensitivity of the optimality condition to a change in real balances, W21. With agents' beliefs fixed on rigidity under the x threshold, agents are relatively more inclined to offset the change in real balances, thus requiring a larger menu cost to leave them indifferent between adjusting and not adjusting for a given monetary shock as in table 2. This same motive, however, implies a stronger reaction of the price level under the x~ threshold. This reduces the change in real balances faced by agents. Along with the reduced concavity due to the fall in -W22, this renders agents' utility less sensitive to monetary shocks. As shown in table 2, this translates to a reduction in the menu costs required for indifference with a 5% shock to the money supply.
5. Conclusion
We have derived a unique threshold equilibrium for the canonical price setting problem studied by Ball and Romer (1990) with fixed costs to price adjustment. By applying ideas often used in the literature on global games, we break the common knowledge of nominal aggregate demand shocks which would sustain the regions of multiple equilibria. We find that BR's comparative statics are sensitive to these multiple equilibria, even in their canonical model of price setting under monopolistic competition. BR's analysis, which assumes the
14

largest possible range of rigidity sustainable as a Nash equilibrium, would conclude that large increases in firms' markups coinciding with small decreases in the labor supply elasticity should decrease nominal rigidity. We find the potential for the opposite conclusion, as the endogenous change in beliefs has a larger impact on price setting than the decrease in real rigidities induced by the parameter changes. While we have restricted ourselves to BR's framework, Dotsey and King (2005) highlight that multiple equilibria resulting from coordination failures are a pervasive feature in the state-dependent pricing literature, which would give our approach the potential for applicability to a broader set of models than examined by BR.

as we assume the prices set by each agent are known to her and the expression above is then linear in pi thus allowing us to pass the expectations operator through. Evaluating this at p1i = E[pi |xi, k], p2i = 0 yields

E[PC(m, p, E[pi |xi, k],0)|xi , k]  -W22(1,1) E[pi |xi, k] 2

(A.9)

To simplify notation, we write

E[p|xi, k] =. h(xi, k,)

and abbreviate

E[PC(m, p, E[pi |xi, k],0)|xi , k] =. PC(xi, k)

thus making the dependence on  explicit.
In order to calculate the payoff difference, we first need to calculate the conditionally expected price level
h(xi, k,). Here we exploit the symmetry of the price setting problem, i.e. we use the fact that agent j = i with signal x j uses an optimal price setting rule of the form given by equation (A.7) and expects the price level h(x j, k,).
Conditional on the threshold strategy around k, agent i calculates,

h(xi, k,) =(1 - )

where the parts (A.11) and (A.13) reflect the definition of the threshold strategy, whereby no agent adjusts her price for signals in the interval [-k, k].

For the value k to constitute a threshold equilibrium, an agent with the marginal signal has to be just
indifferent between adjusting and not adjusting, i.e., the optimal price conditional on observing xi = k must be such that PC0(k, k) = 0. The optimal price in this case is given by

Equating the latter with the menu cost z, yields

Solving for k yields the critical signal

x~ =. k = 1 1 + 

2z

2  -W22(1,1)

which can be written in terms of the thresholds under perfect information, (10) and (8), as expressed in the
proposition. That x~ indeed constitutes a threshold equilibrium follows from the fact that for xi > k, h(xi, k,0) > h(k, k,0) and conversely for xi < k. This implies that we must have PC0(xi, k) > PC0(k, k) = z for xi > k so that agents adjust their price and conversely for xi < k. Finally, uniqueness of the threshold equilibrium is obvious from the expression for PC0(k, k) provided in (A.15): PC0(0,0)- z < 0 and PC0(,)- z > 0 (PC0(-,-)- z < 0) and since PC0(k, k) strictly increases (decreases) in k for k > 0 (k < 0) there exists exactly one value for k (-k) where PC0(k, k) = z (PC0(-k, k) = z).
