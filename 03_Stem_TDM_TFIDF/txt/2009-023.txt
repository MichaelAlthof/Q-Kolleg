Pricing Bermudan options using regression: optimal rates of convergence for lower estimates
Denis Belomestny1,  April 21, 2009

Abstract
The problem of pricing Bermudan options using Monte Carlo and a nonparametric regression is considered. We derive optimal nonasymptotic bounds for a lower biased estimate based on the suboptimal stopping rule constructed using some estimates of continuation values. These estimates may be of different nature, they may be local or global, with the only requirement being that the deviations of these estimates from the true continuation values can be uniformly bounded in probability.
Keywords: Bermudan options; Regression; Boundary condition.

1 Introduction

An American option grants the holder the right to select the time at which
to exercise the option, and in this differs from a European option which may
be exercised only at a fixed date. A general class of American option pricing problems can be formulated through an Rd Markov process {X(t), 0  t 
T } defined on a filtered probability space (, F, (Ft)0tT , P). It is assumed that X(t) is adapted to (Ft)0tT in the sense that each Xt is Ft measurable. Recall that each Ft is a -algebra of subsets of  such that Fs  Ft  F for s  t. We interpret Ft as all relevant financial information available up to time t. We restrict attention to options admitting a finite set of exercise
opportunities 0 = t0 < t1 < t2 < . . . < tL = T , sometimes called Bermudan options. If exercised at time tl, l = 1, . . . , L, the option pays fl(X(tl)), for some known functions f0, f1, . . . , fL mapping Rd into [0, ). Let Tn denote the set of stopping times taking values in {n, n + 1, . . . , L}. A standard
result in the theory of contingent claims states that the equilibrium price

Vn(x) of the American option at time tn in state x given that the option was not exercised prior to tn is its value under an optimal exercise policy:
Vn(x) = sup E[f (X(t ))|X(tn) = x), x  Rd.
 Tn
Pricing an American option thus reduces to solving an optimal stopping problem. Solving this optimal stopping problem and pricing an American option are straightforward in low dimensions. However, many problems arising in practice (see e.g. Glasserman (2004)) have high dimensions, and these applications have motivated the development of Monte Carlo methods for pricing American option. Pricing American style derivatives with Monte Carlo is a challenging task because the determination of optimal exercise strategies requires a backwards dynamic programming algorithm that appears to be incompatible with the forward nature of Monte Carlo simulation. Much research was focused on the development of fast methods to compute approximations to the optimal exercise policy. Notable examples include the functional optimization approach in Andersen (2000), mesh method of Broadie and Glasserman (1997), the regression-based approaches of Carriere (1996), Longstaff and Schwartz (2001), Tsitsiklis and Van Roy (1999) and Egloff (2005). A common feature of all above mentioned algorithms is that they deliver estimates C0(x), . . . , CL-1(x) for the so called continuation values:
(1.1) Ck(x) := E[Vk+1(X(tk+1))|X(tk) = x], k = 0, . . . , L - 1.
An estimate for V0, the price of the option at time t0 can then be defined as
V0(x) := max{f0(x), C0(x)}, x  Rd.
This estimate basically inherits all properties of C0(x). In particular, it is usually impossible to determine the sign of the bias of V0 since the bias of C0 may change its sign. One way to get a lower bound (low biased estimate) for V0 is to construct a (generally suboptimal) stopping rule
 = min{0  k  L : Ck(X(tk))  fk(X(tk))}
with CL  0 by definition. Simulating a new independent set of trajectories and averaging the pay-offs stopped according to  on these trajectories gives us a lower bound V0 for V0. As was observed by practitioners, the so constructed estimate V0 has rather stable behavior with respect to the estimates of continuation values C0(x), . . . , CL-1(x), that is even rather poor estimates of continuation values may lead to a good estimate V0. The aim of this paper is to find a theoretical explanation of this observation and to investigate the properties of V0. In particular, we derive optimal non-asymptotic bounds for the bias V0 - E V0 assuming some uniform probabilistic bounds for Cr - Cr.

It is shown that the bounds for V0 - E V0 are usually much tighter than ones for V0 - E V0 implying a better quality of V0 as compared to the quality of V0 constructed using one and the same set of estimates for continuation values.
The issues of convergence for regression algorithms have been already studied in several papers. Cl¥ement, Lamberton and Protter (2002) were first who proved the convergence of the Longstaff-Schwartz algorithm. Glasserman and Yu (2005) have shown that the number of Monte Carlo paths has to be in general exponential in the number of basis functions used for regression in order to ensure convergence. Recently, Egloff, Kohler and Todorovic (2007) (see also Kohler (2008)) have derived the rates of convergence for continuation values estimates obtained by the so called dynamic look-ahead algorithm (see Egloff (2004)) that "interpolates" between Longstaff-Schwartz and Tsitsiklis-Roy algorithms. They presented the convergence rates for V0 which coincide with the rates of C0 and are determined by the smoothness properties of the true continuation values C0, . . . , CL-1. It turns out that the convergence rates for V0 depend not only on the smoothness of continuation values (as opposite to V0), but also on the behavior of the underlying process near the exercise boundary. Interestingly enough, there are cases where these rates become almost independent either of the smoothness properties of {Ck} or of the dimension of X and the bias of V0 decreases exponentially in the number of Monte Carlo paths used to construct {Ck}.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2.1 we introduce and discuss the so called boundary assumption which describes the behavior of the underlying process X near the exercise boundary and heavily influences the properties of V0. In Section 2.2 we derive non-asymptotic bounds for the bias V0-E V0 and prove that these bounds are optimal in the minimax sense. Finally, we illustrate our results by a numerical example.

2 Main results

2.1 Boundary assumption
For the considered Bermudan option let us introduce a continuation region C and an exercise (stopping) region E :

(2.2)

C := {(i, x) : fi(x) < Ci(x)} , E := {(i, x) : fi(x)  Ci(x)} .

Furthermore, let us assume that there exist constants B0,k > 0, k = 0, . . . , L- 1 and  > 0 such that the inequality

(2.3)

Ptk|t0(0 < |Ck(X(tk)) - fk(X(tk))|  )  B0,k,  > 0,

holds for all k = 0, . . . , L - 1, where Ptk|t0 is the conditional distribution of X(tk) given X(t0). Assumption (2.3) provides a useful characterization

3

of the behavior of the continuation values {Ck} and payoffs {fk} near the exercise boundary E. Although this assumption seems quite natural to look at, we make in this paper, to the best of our knowledge, a first attempt to investigate its influence on the convergence rates of lower bounds based on suboptimal stopping rules.
In the situation when all functions Ck - fk, k = 0, . . . , L - 1 are smooth and have non-vanishing derivatives in the vicinity of the exercise boundary, we have  = 1. Other values of  are possible as well. We illustrate this by two simple examples.

Example 1 Fix some  > 0 and consider a two period (L = 1) Bermudan power put option with the payoffs

(2.4)

f0(x) = f1(x) = (K1/ - x1/)+, x  R+, K > 0.

Denote by  the length of the exercise period, i.e.  = t1 - t0. If the process X follows the Black-Scholes model with volatility  and zero interest rate,
then one can show that

C0(x) := E[f1(X(t1))|X(t0) = x] = K1/(-d2) - x1/e(-1-1)(2/2)(-d1)

with  being the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution,

d1

=

log(x/K )

and d2 = d1 -  /. As can be easily seen, the function C0(x) - f0(x)

satisfies |C0(x) - f0(x)|  x1/ for x  +0 and C0(x) > f0(x) for all x > 0

if   1. Hence

P(0 < |C0(X(t0)) - f0(X(t0))|  ) ,   0,   1.

Taking different  in the definition of the payoffs (2.4), we get (2.3) satisfied for  ranging from 1 to .
In fact, even the extreme case " = " may take place as shown in the next example.

Example 2 Let us consider again a two period Bermudan option such
that the corresponding continuation value C0(x) = E[f1(X(t1))|X(t0) = x] is positive and monotone increasing function of x on any compact set in R.
Fix some x0  R and choose 0 satisfying 0 < C0(x0). Define the payoff function f0(x) in the following way

f0(x) =

C0(x0) + 0, C0(x0) - 0,

x < x0, x  x0.

Figure 1: Illustration to Example 2.

So, f0(x) has a "digital" structure. Figure 1 shows the plots of C0 and f0 in the case where X follows the Black-Scholes model and f1(x) = (x - K)+. It is easy to see that
Pt0 (0 < |C0(X(t0)) - f0(X(t0))|  0) = 0.
On the other hand
C = {x  R : C0(x)  f0(x)} = {x  R : x  x0}, E = {x  R : C0(x) < f0(x)} = {x  R : x < x0}.
So, both continuation and exercise regions are not trivial in this case. The last example is of particular interest because as will be shown in
the next sections the bias of V0 decreases in this case exponentially in the number of Monte Carlo paths used to estimate the continuation values, a lower bound V0 was constructed from.

2.2 Non-asymptotic bounds for V0 - E V0

Let Ck,M , k = 1, . . . , L-1, be some estimates of continuation values obtained

using M paths of the underlying process X starting from x0 at time t0. We

may think of (X(1)(t), . . . , X(M)(t)) as being a vector process on the product

with Am  F, m = 1, . . . , M . Thus, each Ck,M , k = 0, . . . , L - 1, is measurable with respect to FM . The following proposition provides nonasymptotic bounds for the bias V0 - E V0,M of a lower bound V0,M given uniform probabilistic bounds for {Ck,M }.

Proposition 2.1. Suppose that there exist constants B1, B2 and a positive sequence M such that for any  > 0 > 0 it holds

(2.5)

Px0M |Ck,M (x) - Ck(x)|  M-1/2  B1 exp(-B2)

for almost all x with respect to Ptk|t0, the conditional distribution of X(tk) given X(t0), k = 0, . . . , L - 1. Define

(2.6)

V0,M := E fM (X(tM ))|X(t0) = x0

with

(2.7) M := min 0  k  L : Ck,M (X(tk))  fk(X(tk)) .

If the boundary condition (2.3) is fulfilled, then

L-1

0  V0 - EPx0M [V0,M ]  B

with some constant B depending only on , B1 and B2.

The above convergence rates are, in fact, optimal in the following sense.

Proposition 2.2. Fix a set of non-zero payoff functions f0, . . . , fL and let P be a class of pricing measures such that the boundary condition (2.3) is fulfilled with some  > 0. For any positive sequence M satisfying
M-1 = o(1), M = O(M ), M  ,

there exist a subset P, of P and a constant B > 0 such that for any M  1, any stopping rule M and any set of estimates {Ck,M } measurable w.r.t. FM , we have for some  > 0 and k = 0, . . . , L - 1,

sup PM |Ck,M (x) - Ck(x)|  M-1/2 > 0

Finally, we discuss the case when " = ", meaning that there exists 0 > 0 such that

(2.8)

Ptk|t0 (0 < |Ck(X(tk)) - fk(X(tk))|  0) = 0

for k = 0, . . . , L - 1. This is very favorable situation for pricing. It turns

out that if the continuation values estimates {Ck,M } satisfy a kind of expo-
nential inequality and (2.8) holds, then the bias of V0,M converges to zero exponentially fast in M .

Proposition 2.3. Suppose that for any  > 0 there exist constants B1, B2 possibly depending on  and a sequence of positive numbers M not depending on  such that

(2.9)

Px0M |Ck,M (x) - Ck(x)|    B1 exp(-B2M )

for almost all x with respect to Ptk|t0, k = 0, . . . , L - 1. Assume also that there exist a constant Bf > 0 such that

(2.10)

k = 0, . . . , L.

If the condition (2.8) is fulfilled with some 0 > 0, then

0  V0 - EPx0M [V0,M ]  B3 exp(-B4M ) with some constant B3 and B4 depending only on B1, B2 and Bf .

Discussion Let us make a few remarks on the results of this section. First,
Proposition 2.1 implies that the convergence rates of V0,M are always faster
than the convergence rates of {Ck,M } provided that  > 0. Indeed, while the convergence rates of {Ck,M } are of order M-1/2, the bias of V0,M converges to zero as fast as M-(1+)/2. As to the variance of V0,M , it can be made arbitrary small by averaging V0,M over a large number of sets, each consisting of M trajectories, and by taking a large number of new Monte Carlo paths used
to average the payoffs stopped according to M . Second, if the condition (2.8) holds true, then the bias of V0,M decreases
exponentially in M , indicating that even very unprecise estimates of the continuation values would lead to the estimate V0,M of acceptable quality.
Finally, let us stress that the results obtained in this section are quite
general and do not depend on the particular form of the estimates {Ck,M }, only the inequality (2.5) being crucial for the result to hold. This inequality
holds for various types of estimators. These may be global least squares
estimators or local polynomial estimators. In particular, it can be shown that if all continuation values {Ck} belong to the H®older class (, H, Rd) and the conditional law of X satisfies some regularity assumptions, then
the local polynomial estimates of continuation values satisfy inequality (2.5) with M = M 2/(2+d) log-1(M ).

3 Numerical example: Bermudan max call

This is a benchmark example studied in Broadie and Glasserman (1997) and Glasserman (2004) among others. Specifically, the model with d identically distributed assets is considered, where each underlying has dividend yield . The risk-neutral dynamic of assets is given by

dXk (t) Xk (t)

dWk (t),

k = 1, ..., d,

where Wk(t), k = 1, ..., d, are independent one-dimensional Brownian motions and r, ,  are constants. At any time t  {t0, ..., tL} the holder of the option may exercise it and receive the payoff

f (X(t)) = (max(X1(t), ..., Xd(t)) - K)+.

We take d = 2, r = 5%,  = 10%,  = 0.2 and ti = iT /L, i = 0, ..., L, with T = 3, L = 9 as in Glasserman (2004, Chapter 8). First, we estimate all continuation values via the dynamic programming algorithm using the so called Nadaraya-Watson regression estimator

with Yr(+m1) = max(fr+1(X(m)(tr+1)), Cr+1,M (X(m)(tr+1))), r = 0, . . . , L - 1. Here K is a kernel, h > 0 is a bandwidth and (X(m)(t1), . . . , X(m)(tL)), m = 1, . . . , M, is the set of paths of the process X, all starting from the
point x0 = (90, 90) at t0 = 0. As can be easily seen the estimator (3.11) is a local polynomial estimator of degree 0. Upon estimating C1,M , we define an estimate for the price of the option at time t0 = 0 as

V0

Next, using the so constructed estimates of continuation values we construct a stopping policy  which is defined pathwise as

 (n) := min 1  k  L : Ck,M (X(n)(tk))  fk(X(n)(tk)) , n = 1, . . . , N,

where (X(n)(t1), . . . , X(n)(tL)), n = 1, . . . , N, is a new independent set of trajectories of the process X, all starting from x0 = (90, 90) at t0 = 0. The stopping policy  yields a lower bound

In Figure 2 we show the boxplots of V0 and V0 based on 100 sets of trajectories each of the size M = 1000 for different values of the bandwidth h, where the triangle kernel K(x) = (1 - x 2)+ is used to construct (3.11). Also the true value V0 of the option (8.08 in this case), computed using a two-dimensional binomial lattice, is shown as a red base line. Several observations can be made by an examination of Figure 2. First, while the bias of V0 is always smaller then the bias of V0, the largest difference takes place for large h. This can be explained by the fact that for large h more observations Yr(+m1) with X(m)(tr) lying far away from the given point x become involved in the construction of Cr,M (x). This has a consequence of increasing the bias of the estimate (3.11). The most interesting phenomenon is, however, the behavior of V0 which turns out to be quite stable with respect to h. So even in the case of rather poor estimates of continuation values (when h is large) V0 still looks reasonable.
We stress that the aim of this example is not to show the strength of the local polynomial estimation algorithms (for this we would take larger M and higher order kernels) but rather to illustrate the main claim of this paper, namely the claim about the efficiency of V0 as compared to the estimates based on the direct use of continuation values estimates.
4 Conclusion
In this paper we have derived optimal rates of convergence for lower biased estimates of the price of a Bermudan option based on suboptimal exercise policies obtained from some estimates of the optimal continuation values. We have shown that these rates are usually much faster than the convergence rates of the corresponding continuation values estimates. This may explain the efficiency of these lower bounds observed in practice. Moreover, it turns out that there are some cases where the expected values of the lower bounds based on suboptimal stopping rules achieve very fast convergence rates which are exponential in the number of paths used to estimate the corresponding continuation values. This suggests that the algorithms based on suboptimal stopping rules (e.g. Longstaff-Schwartz algorithm) rather than on the direct use of the continuation values estimates might be preferable.

and Vk,M (x) := E[fk,M (X(tk,M ))|X(tk) = x], x  Rd.
The so called Snell envelope process Vk is related to k via Vk(x) = E[fk (X(tk ))|X(tk) = x], x  Rd.
The following lemma provides a useful inequality which will be repeatedly used in our analysis.
Lemma 5.1. For any k = 0, . . . , L - 1, it holds with probability one

Proof. We shall use induction to prove (5.12). For k = L - 1 we have

VL-1(X(tL-1)) - VL-1,M (X(tL-1)) = = EFtL-1 (fL-1(X(tL-1)) - fL(X(tL)))1{L-1=L-1, L-1,M =L}
+ EFtL-1 (fL(X(tL)) - fL-1(X(tL-1)))1{L-1=L, L-1,M =L-1} = |fL-1(X(tL-1)) - CL-1(X(tL-1))|1{L-1,M =L-1}
since events {L-1 = L} and {L-1,M = L} are measurable w.r.t. FtL-1 . Thus, (5.12) holds with k = L-1. Suppose that (5.12) holds with k = L +1. Let us prove it for k = L. Consider a decomposition

with

fL (X(tL )) - fL,M (X(tL,M )) = S1 + S2 + S3

S1 := S2 := S3 :=

fL (X(tL )) - fL,M (X(tL,M )) 1{L >L, L,M >L} fL (X(tL )) - fL,M (X(tL,M )) 1{L >L, L,M =L} fL (X(tL )) - fL,M (X(tL,M )) 1{L =L, L,M >L}.

Since

EFtL [S1] = EFtL VL+1(X(tL+1)) - VL+1,M (X(tL+1)) 1{L >L, L,M >L}, EFtL [S2] = EFtL fL+1 (X(tL+1 )) - fL (X(tL )) 1{L >L, L,M =L}
= (CL (X(tL )) - fL (X(tL ))) 1{L >L, L,M =L}

11

and

EFtL [S3] =

fL (X (tL )) - EFtL fL+1,M (X (tL+1,M )) 1{L =L, L,M >L}

= (fL (X(tL )) - CL (X(tL ))) 1{L =L, L,M >L}

+ EFtL VL+1(X(tL+1)) - VL+1,M (X(tL+1)) 1{L =L, L,M >L} ,

we get with probability one

VL(X(tL )) - VL,M (X(tL )  |fL(X(tL )) - CL(X(tL ))| ◊ 1{L,M >L, L =L} + 1{L,M =L, L >L} + EFtL VL+1(X(tL+1)) - VL+1,M (X(tL+1)) .
Our induction assumption implies now that

|fl(Xl) - Cl(Xl)|

l=L

1{l,M >l, l=l} + 1{l,M =l, l>l}

and hence (5.12) holds for k = L.

Let us continue with the proof of Proposition 2.1. Consider the sets El, Al,j  Rd, l = 0, . . . , L - 1, j = 1, 2, . . . , defined as

El := x  Rd : Cl,M (x)  fl(x), Cl(x) > fl(x)

 x  Rd : Cl,M (x) > fl(x), Cl(x)  fl(x) ,

Al,0 := Al,j :=

,

j > 0.

We may write

5.2 Proof of Proposition 2.2
For the sake of simplicity we consider the case of a three period Bermudan option with two possible exercise dates t1 and t2 (exercise at t0 is not possible). We also assume that the payoff function f2 has a "digital" structure, i.e. it takes two values 0 and 1. The extension to a general case is straightforward but somewhat cumbersome.
We have

(5.13)

V0(X(t0)) - V0,M (X(t0)) = = EFt0 [(f1(X(t1)) - f2(X(t2)))1(1 = 1, 1,M = 2)] + EFt0 [(f2(X(t2)) - f1(X(t1)))1(1 = 2, 1,M = 1)]
= EFt0 |f1(X(t1)) - C1(X(t1))|1{1,M =1} .

For an integer q  1 consider a regular grid on [0, 1]d defined as

2kd + 2q

: ki  {0, . . . , q - 1}, i = 1, . . . , d

.

Let nq(x)  Gq be the closest point to x  Rd among points in Gq. Consider

the partition X1, . . . , Xq d of [0, 1]d canonically defined using the grid Gq (x

and y belong to the same subset if and only if nq(x) = nq(y)). Fix an integer

m  qd. For any i  {1, . . . , m}, define Xi = Xi and X0 = Rd \

m i=1

Xi,

so

that X0, . . . , Xm form a partition of Rd. Denote by Bq,j the ball with the

center in nq(Xj) and radius 1/2q.

Define a hypercube H = {PØ : Ø = (1, . . . , m)  {-1, 1}m} of probabil-

ity distributions PØ of the r.v. (X(t1), f2(X(t2))) valued in Rd ◊{0, 1} as fol-

lows. For any PØ  H the marginal distribution of X(t1) (given X(t0) = x0)

does not depend on Ø and has a bounded density µ w.r.t. the Lebesgue mea-

sure on Rd such that Pµ(X0) = 0 and

Pµ(Xj ) = Pµ(Bq,j ) =

µ(x) dx = , j = 1, . . . , m

Bq,j

for some  > 0. In order to ensure that the density µ remains bounded we assume that qd = O(1).
The distribution of f2(X(t2)) given X(t1) is determined by the probability PØ (f2(X(t2)) = 1|X(t1) = x) which is equal to C1,Ø(x). Define

C1,Ø(x) = f1(x) + j(x), x  Xj, j = 1, . . . , m,

and C1,Ø(x) = f1(x) on X0, where (x) = M-1/2(q[x - nq(x)]), (x) = A( x ) with some constant A > 0 and with  : R+  R+ being a non-
increasing infinitely differentiable function such that (x)  1 on [0, 1/2] and
(x)  0 on [1, ). Without loss of generality we may assume that f1(x) is strictly positive on [0, 1]d, i.e. there exist two real numbers 0 < f- < f+ < 1
such that f-  f1(x)  f+. Taking A small enough, we can then ensure that 0  C1,Ø(x)  1 on Rd. Obviously, it holds (x) = AM-1/2 for x  Bq,j. As to the boundary assumption (2.3), we have

Pµ(0 < |f1(X(t1)) - C1,Ø(X(t1))|  ) =

m

Pµ(0 < |f1(X(t1)) - C1,Ø(X(t1))|  , X(t1)  Bq,j)

and (2.3) holds provided that m = O(M-/2). Let M be a stopping time measurable w.r.t. FM , then the identity (5.13) leads to

with Ø(X(t1)) = f1(X(t1)) - C1,Ø(X(t1)). By conditioning on X(t1), we get

EPØ M EFPtµ0 |Ø (X(t1))|1{1,M =1}

Using now a well known Birg¥e's or Huber's lemma (see, e.g. Devroye, Gyo®rfi and Lugosi, 1996, p. 243), we get

where KH := supP,QH K(P, Q) and K(P, Q) is a Kullback-Leibler distance between two measures P and Q. Since for any two measures P and Q from

5.3 Proof of Proposition 2.3
Using the arguments similar to ones in the proof of Proposition 2.1, we get

(5.14)

V0(X(t0)) - EPx0M [V0,M (X(t0))] 
L-1
0 Ptl|t0 (0 < |Cl(X(tl)) - fl(X(tl))|  0)

+ EFt0 EPx0M [|Cl(X(tl)) - fl(X(tl))|
l=0
◊1{X (tl )El } 1{|Cl (X (tl ))-fl (X (tl ))|>0 }

with El defined as in the proof of Proposition 2.1. The first summand on the right-hand side of (5.14) is equal to zero due to (2.8). Hence, Cauchy-
Schwarz and Minkowski inequalities imply

V0(X(t0)) - EPx0M [V0,M (X(t0))]  L-1 EFt0 | EFtl fl+1(X(tl+1 )) - fl(X(tl))|2 1/2
l=0

L-1

EFt0 Px0M (|Cl(X(tl)) - Cl,M (X(tl))| > 0)

l=0

Now the application of (2.9) finishes the proof.
