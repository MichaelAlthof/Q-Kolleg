Abstract
In the present paper we study the dynamics of penalization parameter  of the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) method proposed by Tibshirani (1996) and extended into quantile regression context by Li and Zhu (2008). The dynamic behaviour of the parameter  can be observed when the model is assumed to vary over time and therefore the fitting is performed with the use of moving windows. The proposal of investigating time series of  and its dependency on model characteristics was brought into focus by H¨ardle et al. (2016), which was a foundation of FinancialRiskMeter (http://frm.wiwi.hu-berlin.de). Following the ideas behind the two aforementioned projects, we use the derivation of the formula for the penalization parameter  as a result of the optimization problem. This reveals three possible effects driving ; variance of the error term, correlation structure of the covariates and number of nonzero coefficients of the model. Our aim is to disentangle these three effect and investigate their relationship with the tuning parameter , which is conducted by a simulation study. After dealing with the theoretical impact of the three model characteristics on , empirical application is performed and the idea of implementing the parameter  into a systemic risk measure is presented. The codes used to obtain the results included in this work are available on http://quantlet.de/d3/ia/.

1 Introduction

The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) method as proposed by Tibshirani (1996) has been widely used and extended during recent years. The literature presents a method which simultaneously completes the task of model selection and parameter estimation, while studying its consistency. A key factor for the estimation precision is choosing a tuning parameter which controls the degree of penalization. Although there is much literature on Lasso, including a time series context, the time variation of the tuning parameter remains unexplored.

Here we explain dynamics of the penalization parameter  and how it can be used in finan-
cial practice, particularly when dealing with systemic risk. Let us assume for the moment
a linear model with a vector of responses Y = (Y1, Y2, . . . , Yn) , a vector of parameters  = (1, . . . , p) , an (n × p) design matrix X, which might be either fixed or random, and a vector of independent identically distributed errors  with zero mean and variance 2. Then
the objective function of Lasso is

with tuning parameter   0 and Xi, 0  i  n, denoting row vectors of X. In (1) one

assumes that the columns of the matrix X = (xij)i=1,...,n,j=1,...,p have been standardized, i.e.

with L1-penalization allows some of the coefficients of the model to shrink to 0. This is

a highly advantageous property when dealing with high-dimensional data, since variable

selection and shrinkage of coefficients are performed simultaneously. Shrinking some of the

coefficients to exactly 0 also improves the interpretability of the fitted model.

Modification of Lasso in quantile regression (Koenker and Basset (1978)) studied by Li and Zhu (2008) and Belloni and Chernozhukov (2011) solves the optimization problem with

The Lasso models described above account for independent observations. However, there is much literature on the Lasso in time series context as well. For the univariate case we refer to Wang et al. (2007), Nardi and Rinaldo (2011) and Chen and Chan (2011). The case of multivariate time series, particularly vector autoregression, was covered by e.g. Hsu et al. (2008).
Lasso in quantile regression has been used by Ha¨rdle et al. (2016) to model tail event dependencies among U.S. financial companies. Based on the penalization parameters the FinancialRiskMeter (FRM), http://frm.wiwi.hu-berlin.de, was developed, see Figure 1.

The value of the averaged penalization parameter  was elevated during the financial crises. This fact led us to the question we indicated above; what drives the penalization parameter  and what are the dynamics of ? We investigate this by simulation study and empirical application.

2 Lasso method

2.1 Lasso as an optimization problem

In this section we firstly follow Osborne et al. (2000) to derive formula for the penalization parameter  of the Lasso method when applied in linear regression problems. Then we aim our focus on the representation of  in penalized quantile regression.

If we treat  as a fixed value in the objective function of the penalized regression



1 n f (, ) =
 2 i=1

2

p


Yi - Xi  +  |j| ,

j=1 

(4)

then the function f (, ) is convex in parameter . Moreover, with diverging  we observe

that f (, )  . Hence there exists at least one minimum of the function f (·, ). According

to Osborne (1985) this minimum is attained in () if and only if the null-vector 0  Rp is

an element of the subdifferential

f (, ) = -X (Y - X) + u(), 

(5)

3

where u() = (u1(), . . . , up()) is defined as uj() = 1 if j > 0, uj() = -1 if j < 0 and

uj()  [-1, 1] if j = 0. Then, for () as a minimizer of f (, ) the following has to be

satisfied

0 = -X {Y - X()} + u(()),

(6)

Here we denote the estimator of a parameter vector  as a function of the penalization

parameter . This dependency follows from the formulation of the penalized regression

method and its objective function (4), where we first select  and then search for () which

minimizes (4). Using the fact that u()  =

p j=1

|j |

=

||||1,

where

|| · ||1

denotes

L1-norm

of a p-dimensional vector, (6) can be further rewritten in the formula

{Y - X()} X() = .
||()||1

(7)

The identity (7) leads us to consider possible constituents which influence the value of parameter  and therein its dynamics when treated in a time-dependent framework. Here we propose to study three effects which are related to the size of :

1. size of residuals of the model; 2. absolute size of the coefficients of the model, ||||1; 3. singularity of a matrix X X.

The second effect can also be translated into the effect of a number of nonzero parameters

the so-called active set of the model, q = ||||0 =

p j=1

I(j

=

0),

where

|| · ||0

stands

for

L0-norm on Rp and I(·) is an indicator function. As a measure of the third structure, the

condition number (X X) defined as the ratio max(X X)/min(X X), the maximum and

the minimum eigenvalue of the matrix X X, can be used.

Similarly, one can derive formulae for the penalization parameter  in a quantile regression problem (2) and (3). Following Li and Zhu (2008)

 X() = ,
||()||1

where  = (1, . . . , n) satisfies the following

  
i = -(1 -  )

 

 (-(1 -  ),  )

if Yi - Xi () > 0; if Yi - Xi () < 0; if Yi - Xi () = 0.

(8) (9)

Hence, we observe that  depends on cardinality of the active set q, which is again influenced by the correlation structure of the design matrix. Direct impact of the variance of residuals disappears and only the sign of the residuals stays in effect. However, when looking at Figure 2 one can see similarities between the time series of  and historic values of the implied volatility index (VIX) reported by the Chicago Board Options Exchange. This fact leads us to believe that the dynamics of  is also influenced by the changes in the variance of model residuals.

2.2 Choosing the penalization parameter
In theory the equalities (7) and (8) hold for every solution of the Lasso optimization problems (1) and (2) respectively, since first  is chosen and afterwards the model is fitted according to the given value of the penalization parameter. One of the commonly used methods of choosing estimator of  is cross-validation in its three forms; k-fold, leave-one-out and generalized cross-validation method, see e.g. Tibshirani (1996). As pointed out in Hastie et al. (2009), cross-validation is a widely used method for estimation of prediction error. This feature is used when estimating  in Lasso method, where, on a grid of penalization parameters , the one which minimizes estimated prediction error is chosen. However, as Leng et al. (2006) argued in their work, methods of choosing penalization parameter based on prediction accuracy are in general not consistent when variable selection is considered. The same argument was used by Wang et al. (2009) where they compared the asymptotic behaviour of the generalized cross-validation to the one of Akaike's information criterion (AIC); it is efficient if one is interested in the model error, but inconsistent in selecting the true model.
The second widely used method of estimating  is the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). By 0 = (01, . . . , 0p) we denote the true vector of coefficients of the regression model and q0 defines the number of its nonzero elements, i.e. 0j = 0 for 1  j  q0 and 0j = 0 for j > q0. The permutation of the elements of 0 is performed without loss of generality, so the previous notation holds. Secondly, by S = {j1, . . . , jq} we denote an arbitrary model with XS = (Xj1, . . . , Xjq )  Rn×q as a design matrix associated with it. Vector of coefficients of a model S is S = (j1, . . . , jq ) and the model size is |S| = q. The true model is referred to by S0.
5

Using the notation from above, the BIC is written in the following form

BICS

=

log(S2 )

+

|S

|

log(n) n

Cn,

(10)

with S2 = n-1 SSES = infS (n-1||Y - XS S ||22) where || · ||2 denotes L2-norm of a vector and Cn is some positive constant. Wang and Leng (2007) prove the consistency of (10) in
selecting a true model also for a diverging parameter vector dimension p and a true number

of nonzero coefficients q0. This is shown in unpenalized as well as in penalized regression models.

Modification of (10) in terms of a tuning parameter leads to

BIC

=

log(2 )

+

|S

|

log(n) n

Cn,

(11)

where 2 = n-1 SSE = n-1||Y - X()||22 and S = {j : ()j = 0}. The estimation of the tuning parameter  is then chosen by minimizing (11) with Cn = log{log(p)} or Cn = n/p, see Chand (2012).

Consistency of the BIC selector holds for the penalized regression methods such as smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) method defined by Fan and Li (2001) and adaptive Lasso introduced by Zou (2006). For the regular Lasso method by Tibshirani (1996) the additional assumption on a design matrix X called irrepresentable condition has to be fulfilled.

The aforementioned condition was presented by Zhao and Yu (2006). Firstly they assumed that n-1X X p C, with C a positive definite matrix

C=

C11 C12 C21 C22

.

(12)

Here C11 is a (q0 × q0) matrix that corresponds to the q0 active predictors and is assumed to be invertible. Then the formulation of the irrepresentable condition is

C21C1-11 sgn(S0 ) k  1, k = 1, . . . , p - q0.

(13)

Adopting the notation from above, q0 is a number of nonzero parameters in the true model S0 and sgn(S0) = (sgn(01), . . . , sgn(0q0)) with sign function sgn(j) = 1 if j > 0, sgn(j) = -1 if j < 0 and sgn(j) = 0 if j = 0.

Modified selection criteria for penalized quantile regression which were used by Li and Zhu (2008) are BIC for quantile regression presented by Koenker et al. (1994) and generalized approximate cross-validation criterion (GACV) introduced by Yuan (2006)

(14) (15)

where df() stands for the estimated effective dimension of the fitted model. Li and Zhu (2008) argued that number of interpolated observations Yi denoted by E is a plausible measure for this quantity, i.e. df() = |E|.

2.3 Algorithms to solve Lasso
Finding a feasible solution of the optimization problems (1) and (2) can be computationally demanding, since one has to check all of the combinations of values of the tuning parameter  and its respective model parameter estimates (). Only after all of the possible combinations are found, the particular method of choosing  can be applied.
The first algorithm for finding solution of Lasso was presented by Tibshirani (1996) in his work introducing the Lasso method itself. Then Osborne et al. (2000) developed an algorithm which works not only for the case where p < n but also n > p. In order to make the computation more efficient, Efron et al. (2004) proposed the use of the least angle regression algorithm (LARS). The latter procedure is as efficient as a single least squares fit and can also be used in cases where number of parameters of the investigated model is much larger than the number of observations. As a selection criterion of  for LARS, Efron et al. (2004) suggested to use Cp-type selection criterion. Zou et al. (2007) then defined model selection criteria such as Cp, Akaike information criterion (AIC) and BIC suitable for the Lasso framework.
Another approaches to find a path of Lasso solutions, particularly for the quantile regression, were proposed by Belloni and Chernozhukov (2011) and Li and Zhu (2008). The second one comes into focus in this paper, since one is interested in modeling tail event dependencies when dealing with systemic risk evaluations.
3 Simulation study
As derived in the previous section, the penalization parameter  of the Lasso regression depends on three effects. The factors driving its dynamics are variance of the error term of the model, conditionality of the matrix X X and absolute size of the coefficients of the model, ||||1. In this section we conduct simulations which describe the relationships between these three effects and the parameter  focusing mainly on a quantile regression case. Our aim is to disentangle these effects and find the way to explain behaviour of  in dependency of the three aforementioned elements.
3.1 Penalty  dependent on variance 2
Firstly we investigate the effect of the size of variance 2 of the error term  on the penalty parameter . According to the identity (7)  is supposed to rise with higher 2 and vice versa. This holds for the linear regression problem, and as discussed previously for the quantile regression as well. The evidence is visible from Figure 2, whereas when considering the formula (8) this dependency is not straightforward to follow.
In our simulation study we use quantile regression model Y = X +  with a vector of responses Y = (Y1, . . . , Yn) , a vector of parameters  = (1, . . . , p) , an (n × p) design matrix X and iid error term  = (1, . . . , n) such that P(i  0|Xi = x) =  for almost every x  Rp with   (0, 1) denoting conditional quantile of Y .
7

The design matrix X is simulated from the p-dimensional normal distribution

{Xi}in=1  Np(0, ), where the elements of (p × p) covariance matrix  = (ij)pi,j=1 are defined as follows
ij = |i-j| for i, j = 1, . . . , p,

(16) (17)

with  = 0.5 as in Tibshirani (1996). Here we select n = 600 and p = 100. In order to study

the effect of increased dispersion (in the error term ) on , the vector of parameters is set

to

0(100×1) = (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, . . . , 0) .

(18)

The error term is simulated such that its variance changes after the observation i0 = 300.

We assume i for i = 1, . . . , n to be independently distributed with asymmetric Laplace

distribution



 

ALD(0,

1,

0.05),

i 

if i  i0 .

(19)

 

ALD(0,

2,

0.05),

i > i0

The density of asymmetric Laplace distribution is

f (x|µ, ,  ) =  (1 -  ) exp -  (x - µ) , 

(20)

with location parameter µ, scale parameter  > 0, skewness parameter   (0, 1) and the check function  (·) as defined in (3). The idea to use this type of distribution comes from Lee et al. (2014).

We simulate 50 scenarios using the algorithm designed by Li and Zhu (2008) and select  according to BIC (14). For model fitting we apply moving windows technique to capture the dynamics of the tuning parameter . The size of the moving window is set to be w = 80. Resulting values of  obtained by simulation settings above are, together with other model characteristics of interest, captured in Figure 3.

As can be seen from Figure 3, the values of the estimated tuning parameter  are indeed increasing with higher variation 2 of the error term. Number of nonzero parameters q0 = ||0||0 was set to be constant over all n = 600 observations and also the level around which the condition number (X X) fluctuates stays constant. However, the L1-norm of estimated model coefficients ||()||1 changes with higher values of . Since that is an idea of the Lasso method itself, this can be seen as a natural effect.

In order to study the size of impact of 2 on  we conducted a set of simulations, where different values of scale parameter  were used after the change point i0. The starting value was defined as in the previous case,  = 1, and the relative and absolute change of average  were examined. Observed changes are noted in Table 1.

From Table 1 one can see that the penalization parameter  increases in dependency of the change in the scale parameter  of the distribution of the error term in the assumed model. This conclusion of course corresponds to what we see from Figure 2. Again we use BIC as a selection criterion. However, as discussed before, theoretically other methods yield the same dependency structure.

3.2 Penalty  dependent on model size q

The second effect driving the size of the penalization parameter  is the number of nonzero

parameters q. In order to study this case, the design matrix X was again set as in (16) and

(17) with  = 0.5. The error term i was simulated to have scale  = 1 for all 1  i  n and the change in vector of model parameters  came into focus. The number of nonzero

parameters of the model was defined by setting 0 to have the form

  (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, . . . , 0) , 
0i = (1, 1, . . . , 1, 0, . . . , 0) ,
  10×

i  i0 i > i0.

(21)

Thus, the first i0 simulated observations have five active parameters and the rest has ten of them.

The paths of the values of  obtained from the aforementioned simulation settings are plotted in Figure 4. Visible are also other characteristics of the model which we are interested in to examine.

As expected from (8) defining , an increasing value of ||()||1 or q results in a decreasing

10

value of the tuning parameter . In this specific case ||0||1 = q0. From Figure 4 one can see that the value of  decreased with higher q.

To study the reaction of  on the cardinality of the active set q, we performed simulations
with different changes of q after the observation i0, the starting value was always q0 = 5. The results are summarized in Table 2. From equation (8) the relationship between  and ||()||0 as well as q is inversely proportional and values in Table 2 correspond to this statement.

Table 2: Relative and absolute change in averaged values of  before and after the change point i0 = 300 with starting number of nonzero parameters q0i = 5 for i  i0.

We may conclude that the cardinality of the active set q has a real impact on change in value of . Since in (8) the effect of q is captured by the effect of ||()||1, this is also of our interest. Another simulation was conducted to investigate the impact of the L1-norm of the model coefficients. Previously the coefficients were hard thresholded, i.e. cut off abruptly and set to be zero. Now the parameters are allowed to decrease to zero more smoothly

(1, 0.9, 0.8, . . . , 0.2, 0.1, 0, . . . , 0)

,

i > i0,

(22)

i.e. ||0i||1 = 10 for i  i0 and ||0i||1 = 5.5 for i > i0.

We put this simulation setting forward, because it seems more natural that the effect of particular covariates fades away rather than disappears. Time series of model characteristics of this case are to be found in Figure 5. The relative and absolute change of average  after the point i0 = 300 is 1.245 and 0.091 respectively.

3.3 Penalty  dependent on design

We examine the dependency of the parameter  on the design matrix X of the given model through the characteristics called condition number of a matrix:

(X

X) = max(X

X) ,

min(X X)

where max(·) and min(·) are the largest and the smallest eigenvalues of a matrix. If the condition number  is low the problem is called well-conditioned, matrices with higher  values are referred to as ill-conditioned. The condition number can help to diagnose a multicollinearity issue. With the presence of multicollinearity, one can expect more coefficients to be incorrectly defined as significant and therefore values of q and ||||1 to rise. This is in

Figure 5: Time series of  (blue), other model characteristics and their respective averages (red) drawn from the 50 simulations with change of ||0i||1 after i0 = 300, moving windows of length 80.
XFGTVP BetaChange

analogy to the situation described in the previous subsection and regarding the formula (8) we expect the tuning parameter  to decrease with higher condition number of the matrix X X.
The simulation settings are as follows; parameter 0 as in (18) and the error term is iid with i  ALD(0, 1, 0.05) for 0  i  n. The design matrix X is simulated from (16) and (17), but here the parameter  is allowed to change after the point i0 = 300. The case where i = 0 for i  i0 and i = 0.5 for i > i0 is illustrated in Figure 6.
Indeed, our expectations presented above hold true. Increased correlation between the covariates and with that increased condition number (X X) result in decreasing values of the estimated tuning parameter . This case together with other simulated changes in correlation structure between covariates are summarized in Table 3. Starting value of  from (17) is always 0.

3.4 All factors affecting the value of 

So far we investigated the effect of the change in the variance of error term 2, in structure of the vector of parameters  and in the correlation structure of the covariates ceteris paribus. In this subsection we focus on all of the factors driving dynamics of  at once and examine the strength of their impact when combined together.

13

For each of the elements driving the dynamics of the penalization parameter  we simulated three cases. The values of interest either stayed constant, increased or decreased after the point i0 = 300. If constant, the scale parameter  of the distribution of the error term was set to be 1. Otherwise it increased from the value of 1 to 2 or decreased from 2 to the value of 1. Number of nonzero parameters was either q0 = 5 for all n = 600 observations or it increased to the value q0 = 10 or decreased from q0 = 10 to q0 = 5 after the point i0. The change of the design matrix was again defined by the change of the correlation structure between corresponding covariates, i.e. change of  from (17). For the constant case it was set to be  = 0.5, when increased it had value 0.9 after the i0-th observation and for the decreasing case it was  = 0.9 for i  i0 and  = 0.5 for i > i0.

Results of all combinations of the changes in the factors having impact on  are summarized in Table 4. There we can see that the effects can overpower each other when combined. This holds particularly for the cases, when the condition number  is increased and number of nonzero parameters q0 decreased and vice versa. This fact can be explained by the issue of multicollinearity as discussed before.

Empirically, when considering the situation on financial markets (particularly modeling of stock prices), increased volatility indicates elevated risk. Parameter  is sensitive to the changes in degree of variation and therefore can be bound to the risk evaluation problem. Another aspect indicating time series of  as a measure of systemic risk is its dependency on interconnectedness of financial institutions, which can be measured by the number of nonzero parameters in estimated model and their magnitude.

4 Empirical analysis
4.1 Data description
In order to be able to apply our insight to the FinancialRiskMeter (http://frm.wiwi. hu-berlin.de), we closely follow the choice of data of H¨ardle et al. (2016). Due to the computational efficiency, our dataset consists of daily stock returns of the first 100 largest U.S. financial companies ordered by market capitalization according to NASDAQ company list. In the FRM case it is 200. The stock returns are downloaded from Yahoo Finance and the list of the corresponding companies is to be found in Table 6.
As a characterization of the general state of the economy, six macroprudential variables are used as covariates in our model settings. These are implied volatility index reported by
14

the Chicago Board Options Exchange, daily S&P500 index returns, daily Dow Jones U.S. Real Estate index returns, changes in the three-month Treasury bill rate, changes in the slope of the yield curve corresponding to the yield spread between the ten-year Treasury rate and the three-month bill rate and, finally, changes in the credit spread between BAA-rated bonds and the Treasury rate. The former three are obtained from Yahoo Finance and the latter three from the Federal Reserve Board. The macro state variables are summarized in Table 7. The data are downloaded with help of FRM download data.
All of the variables are recorded in the time interval from 03 January 2007 to 17 August 2016. For the macroprudential variables we use 1 day lagged values.
4.2 Construction of time series of 
In order to capture interdependencies among the companies and to reduce the dimensionality of the data set into single time series of the penalization parameter  of the Lasso regression, we proceed as follows.
We take each of the 100 companies as a dependent variable and use the remaining 99 together with the macro variables as predictors, i.e. p = 105. This way we get hundred regression models, which are then fitted with help of the quantile Lasso method by Li and Zhu (2008). To record the dynamics of , we use moving windows of size 63 observations (n = 63) which in this case represents 3 months.
Within each window algorithm designed by Li and Zhu (2008) is used to fit the Lasso model. Then the best fit and with it also the tuning parameter  are chosen with help of the BIC criterion (14). We obtain time series of tuning parameters k for each of the hundred regressed companies. These are plotted in Figure 7(a) together with the average over all estimated parameters k, k = 1, . . . , 100, which we are interested in.
Indeed as suggested in our previous simulation study,  is driven by characteristics of an investigated model. From Figure 7 we can see that its values are higher when the residuals of the model are higher, too. There are several peaks in time series of , which correspond to time periods of financial crises. This fact drives us to the conclusion that the dynamics of  can serve as an indicator of a systemic risk.
4.3  and systemic risk measures
In the past decade, much attention has been paid to measuring of systemic risk, particularly after the financial crisis between 2007 and 2009. It has uncovered the cross-sectional dependencies among financial institutions to be important when determining the risk on the market. Adrian and Brunnermeier (2016), Hautsch et al. (2015) and Ha¨rdle et al. (2016), just to mention a few, dealt with evaluating systemic risk according to the relevance of each financial institution itself. This inspired us to connect the Lasso parameter  with the systemic risk, since it depends not only on the volatility but also on the size of model parameters and the correlation structure of the design matrix. The latter two effects can be translated into the connectedness of financial institutions throughout the market.

XFGTVP FRM
To illustrate the connection between  computed according to the method mentioned previously and other systemic risk measures, we plotted their common time development starting from 3 April 2007 to 17 August 2016, see Figure 8.
We chose VIX to show the dependency between  and volatility observed on the financial market. The Standard & Poor's 500 stock market index (S&P500) moves in opposite direction of , which can also provide some information about behaviour of  in connection to the situation on financial markets. Another systemic risk measure is CoVaR presented by Adrian and Brunnermeier (2016) and extended by H¨ardle et al. (2016), where a single index model for generalized quantile regression instead of linear quantile regression was employed. The data for CoVaRS were downloaded from TENET VaR CoVaR where only weekly data between 7 December 2007 and 4 January 2013 were available. Financial turbulence as a risk measure was proposed by Kritzman and Li (2010). Its comovement with the time series of  is visible from the Figure 8(d). A composite indicator of systemic risk (CISS) is an indicator of contemporaneous stress in the financial system developed by Hollo´ et al. (2012) and computed for the area of Europe on weekly basis. Even when considering another financial market, particularly collecting data from another countries, periods where CISS was elevated correspond to the periods of higher  values. And, finally, credit spread, i.e. changes in

the credit spread between BAA-rated bonds and the Treasury rate, suggested by Giglio et al. (2016), was used to relate  to systemic risk level.
From Figure 8 it is visible, that  has a common trend with some of the aforementioned systemic risk measures. For CoVaRS and S&P500 index it holds, that their time development goes in opposite direction compared to .
In order to show there is a comovement between  and other systemic risk measures also from the statistical point of view, we conducted several cointegration tests. When looking

17

at Figure 8 one can see, that the time series of observed measures are nonstationary, however, there may exist cointegration relations between them which would make it a stationary stochastic process.

As a testing procedure we chose the Johansen (1991) test, where we used its eigenvalue type. In Table 5 there are stated resulting values of test statistics and their corresponding critical values on significance levels 10 % and 5%. Variable r corresponds to a number of cointegration relations found between the two investigated nonstationary time series, i.e. for the valid inference we require that r = 1.

Table 5: Cointegration of  with systemic risk measures, r is number of cointegration relations in Johansen procedure, measures cointegrated with  are written in bold.

In Table 5 we included 3 more systemic risk measures. We chose also CoVaR computed with variable selection based on linear quantile regression (CoVaRL). Another systemic risk measure is the volatility connectedness index designed by Diebold and Yilmaz (2014) and accessed from http://financialconnectedness.org. Yield slope denotes changes in the slope of the yield curve corresponding to the yield spread between the 10-year Treasury rate and the 3-month bill rate.
As we can see, many of the measures are cointegrated with the estimated Lasso parameter .

5 Summary
In the present paper we proposed to study dynamics of the penalization parameter of the Lasso regression by Tibshirani (1996) and its quantile regression extension by Li and Zhu (2008). We focused on three effects driving the time-dependent behaviour of the penalization parameter , particularly variation of the model residuals, size of active set of the model and the covariance structure of its respective design matrix.
In the simulation study we justified our expectations about relationships between the aforementioned effects and . These results led us to relate the dynamics of  to the evaluation of systemic risk, since both interdependency among covariates and variability of the error term are neatly connected to the problem of risk controlling.
For the empirical study we chose to follow the setup of the risk control time series FinancialRiskMeter (http://frm.wiwi.hu-berlin.de) and focused on 100 largest U.S. financial companies and 6 macroprudential variables to obtain time series of the estimated Lasso parameter . Consequently, we found cointegration relations between estimated  and several systemic risk measures.
Thus, we may conclude there is a substantiated reason to study time series of  and build theoretical model, which would provide further insight into prediction of the Lasso parameter  and systemic risk simultaneously. Furthermore, implementing our work into time series context or the network framework might be of interest.
