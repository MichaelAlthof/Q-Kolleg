A control approach to robust utility maximization with logarithmic utility and time-consistent penalties
Daniel Hern´andez­Hern´andez and Alexander Schied This version: July 5, 2006

Abstract: We propose a stochastic control approach to the dynamic maximization of robust utility functionals that are defined in terms of logarithmic utility and a dynamically consistent convex risk measure. The underlying market is modeled by a diffusion process whose coefficients are driven by an external stochastic factor process. In particular, the market model is incomplete. Our main results give conditions on the minimal penalty function of the robust utility functional under which the value function of our problem can be identified with the unique classical solution of a quasilinear PDE within a class of functions satisfying certain growth conditions. The fact that we obtain classical solutions rather than viscosity solutions is important for the use of numerical algorithms, whose applicability is demonstrated in examples.

1 Introduction

One of the fundamental problems in mathematical finance and mathematical economics is the construction of investment strategies that maximize the utility functional of a riskaverse investor. In the majority of the corresponding literature, the optimality criterion is based on a classical expected utility functional of von Neumann-Morgenstern form, which requires the choice of a single probabilistic model P. In reality, however, the choice of P is often subject to model uncertainty. Schmeidler [24] and Gilboa and Schmeidler [10] therefore proposed the use of robust utility functionals of the form

where Q is a set of prior probability measures. In analogy to the move from coherent to convex risk measures, Maccheroni et al. [16] recently suggested to model investor preferences by robust utility functionals of the form

where  is a penalty function defined on the set of all possible probabilistic models.

Optimal investment problems for robust utility functionals (1) were considered, among others, by Talay and Zheng [25], Quenez [20], Schied [21], Burgert and Ru¨schendorf [3], Schied and Wu [23], F¨ollmer and Gundel [8], and the authors [12]. For the generalized utility functionals of type (2), the most popular choice for the penalty function has so far been the entropic penalty function (Q) = kH(Q|P) for a constant k > 0 and a reference probability measure P; see, e.g., Hansen and Sargent [11] and Bordigoni et al. [2] for studies of the optimal consumption problem. The duality theory for the optimal investment problem with a general penalty function  was developed by Schied [22]. Robust utility maximization is also closely related to other optimization problems involving convex and coherent risk measures, and these problems also received a lot of attention recently; see, for instance, Barrieu and El Karoui [1], Jouini et al. [13], or Kl¨oppel and Schweizer [14, 15].
In this paper, we propose a stochastic control approach to the dynamic maximization of robust utility functionals of the form (2). The penalty function  will be defined in a Brownian setting and, apart from certain basic requirements such as time consistency, has a rather general form. In particular, we will go beyond the very particular situation of entropic penalties and include the `coherent' setting (1) as a special case. Our setting will involve logarithmic utility U (x) = log x and an incomplete financial market model, whose volatility, interest rate process, and trend are driven by an external stochastic factor process.
Our goal consists in characterizing the value function and the optimal investment strategy via the solution of a quasilinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman PDE. As a byproduct, we also obtain a formula for the least-favorable martingale measure in the sense of F¨ollmer and Gundel [8]. In contrast to earlier approaches such as [25], we avoid the use of viscosity solutions and concentrate our effort on obtaining strong regularity results, which allow us to identify the value function as a unique classical solution of the PDE in question. Regularity of solutions is important because it justifies the use of standard numerical methods for solving the PDE, and we will use such methods in illustrating some interesting qualitative properties of the optimal strategy.
Our method consists in combining the duality results from [22] with a PDE approach to the dual problem of determining optimal martingale measures. This technique has already been applied successfully by Castan~eda-Leyva and Hern´andez-Hern´andez [4, 5] to the maximization of von Neumann-Morgenstern expected utility and by the authors [12] in the maximization of `coherent' robust utility functionals of the form (1). It turns out, however, that the introduction of the penalty function  yields new types of problems, in particular if certain measures Q with (Q) <  have to be described by unbounded control processes (this is the case, e.g., for entropic penalties). To deal with this case, we have to introduce new arguments both on the probabilistic and on the analytic side of the problem.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe the set-up of the problem and state the theorems containing our main findings. These theorems will be proved in the subsequent sections. Section 3 analyzes how certain classes of probability measures Q  P can be described by a suitable sets of control processes. The dual problem for our

3

robust utility maximization problem is formulated in Section 4. In Section 5 we derive the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman PDE for the value function via the dual problem and we prove a verification result. This verification result will suffice to prove our results in the special case where the effective domain of  is a compact set of probability measures that are all equivalent to the reference measure P. In Section 6 we consider the case in which (Q) can be finite for measures Q that are not equivalent but only absolutely continuous with respect to P. Since the market model may admit arbitrage opportunities under such a measure Q, it is clear that the corresponding problem must become more involved, and it turns out that complications also appear on the analytical side of the problem.

2 Statement of main results

We consider a financial market model with a locally riskless money market account

dSt0 = St0r(Yt) dt

and a risky asset defined under a reference measure P through the SDE

dSt = Stb(Yt) dt + St(Yt) dWt1.
Here W 1 is a standard P-Brownian motion and Y denotes an external economic factor process modeled by the SDE

dYt = g(Yt) dt +  dWt1 +  dWt2,

(3)

where   [-1, 1] is some correlation factor,  := 1 - 2, and W 2 is a standard PBrownian motion, which is independent of W 1 under P. We suppose that the economic
factor cannot be traded directly so that the market model will typically be incomplete. We assume that g(·) is in C2(R) with derivative g  Cb1(R), and r(·), b(·), and (·)
belong to Cb2(R), where Cbk(R) denotes the class of bounded functions with bounded derivatives up to order k. The `market price of risk' is defined via the function

(y)

:=

b(y) - r(y) (y)

,

and we will assume that (·)  0 > 0 for some constant 0. The assumption of timeindependent coefficients is for notational convenience only and can easily be relaxed.
In most economic situations, investors typically face model uncertainty in the sense that the dynamics of the relevant quantities are not precisely known. One common approach to coping with model uncertainty is to allow in principle all probability models corresponding to probability measures Q  P and to penalize each such model with a penalty (Q). To define (Q), we assume henceforth that everything is modeled on the canonical path space (, F , (Ft)) of W = (W 1, W 2). Then every probability measure Q  P admits a progressively measurable process  = (1, 2) such that

dQ dP

=

E

1t dWt1 + 2t dWt2 T

Q-a.s.,

4

where E(M )t = exp(Mt - M t/2) denotes the Doleans-Dade exponential of a continuous semimartingale M ; see Lemma 3.1 below. Such a measure Q will receive a penalty

T

(Q) := EQ

h(t) dt ,

0

(4)

where h : R2  [0, ] is convex and lower semicontinuous. For simplicity, we will suppose
h(0) = 0 so that (P) = 0. We will also assume that h is continuously differentiable on its effective domain dom h := {  R2 | h() < } and satisfies the coercivity condition

h(x)  1|x|2 - 2 for some constants 1, 2 > 0.

(5)

The choice h(x) = |x|2/2 corresponds to the entropic penalty function considered in

Hansen and Sargent [11] and Bordigoni et al. [2]; see Remark 2.6 below. Again, our

assumption that h does not depend on time is for notational convenience only.

Let A denote the set of all progressively measurable process  such that

and thus describes the evolution of the wealth process Xx, of an investor with initial endowment X0x, = x > 0 investing the fraction s of the current wealth into the risky asset at time s  [0, T ].
The objective of the investor consists in

Here,  · x denotes the inner product of  and x. The easy case is the one in which the effective domain of h is compact:

Theorem 2.1 Suppose that dom h is compact. Then the value function u of the robust utility maximization problem satisfies

u(x) = log x + v(T, Y0),

where v : [0, T ]×R  R is the unique classical solution to (9) within the class of functions in C1,2((0, T ) × R)  C([0, T ] × R) satisfying a polynomial growth condition.
Suppose furthermore that  : [0, T ]×R  R is a measurable function such that (t, y)
belongs to the supergradient of the concave function x  (y, x) at x = (, )vy(t, y). Then an optimal strategy  for the robust problem can be obtained by letting

t

1(T

- t, Yt) + (Yt)

0  t  T.

Moreover, by defining a measure Q  P via

dQ dP

=

E

(T - t, Yt) dWt ,
0T

we obtain a saddlepoint (, Q) for the maximin problem (7).

(10)

The regularity of the value function obtained in the preceding theorem is important, because it justifies the use of standard numerical methods for solving the PDE (9). In Example 2.7, we will use such methods in illustrating some qualitative properties of the optimal strategy.

Remark 2.2 The proof of Theorem 2.1 will show that the probability measure P  with

density

dP  dP

=

E

-

(Ys) dWs1 +

2(T - s, Ys) dWs2 T

is a least favorable martingale measure in the sense of F¨ollmer and Gundel [8]. This will

also be true in the setting of Theorems 2.3 and 2.5.

The problem becomes more difficult when dom h is noncompact, because then we can no longer apply standard theorems on the existence of classical solutions to (9). Other difficulties appear when dom h is not only noncompact but also unbounded. For instance,

6

we may have (Q) <  even if Q is not equivalent but merely absolutely continuous with
respect to P, and this leads to difficulties when one tries to work directly on the primal problem; see Remark 4.2. Moreover, since the optimal  takes values in the unbounded
set dom h, one needs an additional argument to ensure that the stochastic exponential in (10) is a true martingale and hence defines a probability measure Q  P. Our strategy to get the necessary integrability of the process 1(T - t, Yt) is to use qualitative properties of solutions v to (9) as to control the growth of the gradient vy. In doing so, we have to eliminate the possible competition between the linear term gvy and the nonlinear term (vy) by imposing a growth condition on .

Theorem 2.3 Suppose that g is bounded and that there exists some  > 0 such that

lim inf
|p|

(y, p) p

  + |g(y)|.

(11)

Then the value function u of the robust utility maximization problem satisfies u(x) =
log x + v(T, Y0) where v is the unique classical solution of (9) within the class of functions in C1,2((0, T ) × R)  C([0, T ] × R) with bounded gradient vy. Under these conditions, also the conclusions on the optimal strategy  and the measure Q in Theorem 2.1 remain true.

The most interesting case is the one in which both dom h and the function g are unbounded. Here we need an additional condition on the shape of the function . Note that g is unbounded if, e.g., Y is an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.

Definition 2.4 Let f : R2  R be an upper semicontinuous concave function. We will say that f satisfies a radial growth condition in direction x  R2 if there exist positive
constants p0 and C such that

max |z| z  f (px)  C 1 + |p+f (px)|  |p-f (px)|

for p  R, |p|  p0,

where f (px) denotes the supergradient of f in px and p+f (px) and p-f (px) are the right-hand and left-hand derivatives of the concave function p  f (px).

Note that if f is of the form f (x) = f0(|x|) for some convex increasing function f0, then the radial growth condition is satisfied in any direction x = 0 with constant C = 1.

Theorem 2.5 Suppose that |(y, p)/p)|   as |p|   and assume that (y, ·) satisfies a radial growth condition in direction (, ), uniformly in y. Then the value function u of the robust utility maximization problem satisfies u(x) = log x + v(T, Y0) where v is the unique classical solution of (9) within the class of polynomially growing functions in C1,2((0, T ) × R)  C([0, T ] × R) whose gradient satisfies a growth condition of the form
p- y; vy(t, y)  p+ y; vy(t, y)  C1(1 + |y|)
for some constant C1. Under these conditions, also the conclusions on the optimal strategy  and the measure Q in Theorem 2.1 remain true.

In this case, the robust utility maximization problem (7) is equivalent to the maximization of the standard expected utility E[ U (XTx,) ] for the HARA utility function U (x) = -x-q. This standard utility maximization problem is covered as a special case of Theorem 2.5.
Indeed, the function  has the quadratic form

and it is easily checked that it satisfies the radial growth condition in any direction.

Example 2.7 Here we will give some numerical results for the case in which P is such that Y is an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with g(y) = 100 - y and S follows the SDE

dSt = St

We suppose that r = 0. Then  is given by (y) = y/5. Let us first consider the `coherent'

case

h1() =

0 

if |1|  20 and 2 = 0, otherwise.

The corresponding penalty function 1(Q) takes only the values 0 and . If  = 0 then the optimal  is given by 2(t, y) = 0 and

1(t, y) =

-(y) -20 sign(y)

if |y|  100, otherwise.

In particular, our formula for  shows that there will be no investment into the risky asset as long as the factor process Y stays in the interval [-100, 100]. This corresponds to the fact that S has a local martingale dynamic under the `worst-case measure' Q as long as -100  Yt  100.
A nonzero correlation factor , however, can change the picture. This is illustrated in Figure 1, which shows the function v for the `coherent' penalty function h1 but with nonzero correlation  = 1/2. This figure clearly exhibits a nonvanishing gradient of

v, which leads in turn to a nontrivial investment into the risky asset--despite the fact that for -100  Yt  100 we can still turn S locally into a martingale by choosing an appropriate probability measure Q with 1(Q) = 0. This effect occurs as a tradeoff between the tendencies of minimizing asset returns and driving Y further away from `favorable regions' under the `worst-case measure' Q.
Figure 2 shows the function v for the case in which we add to the relative entropy H(Q|P) to the penalty function 1. That is, we use the function

if |1|  20 and 2 = 0, otherwise.

It can be compared to the value function for the standard utility maximization problem with subjective measure P, which is plotted in Figure 3.

Proof: If Q  P is given, we let Dt := dQ/dP|Ft and define n := inf{t  0 | Dt  1/n}.

By representing the local P-martingale

The following concept of a localized martingale measure is related to the extended martingale measures recently introduced by F¨ollmer and Gundel [8]. We define as usual F :=  t0 Ft .

Definition 3.2 A localized martingale measure is a probability measure P on F for which there exists an increasing sequence (n) of stopping times, called a localizing sequence for P , such that n()   for all    and such that P is equivalent to P on each Fn. Moreover, the density process

Zt =

dP dP

,
Ft

0  t,

understood in the sense of the Lebesgue decomposition, is supposed to be P-a.s. strictly positive and such that ZS/S0 is a local P-martingale. By P we will denote the set of all
localized martingale measures.

In the sequel, M will denote the set of all progressive processes  such that

t 0

s2()

ds

<

 for all t and . Recall that we assume that everything is modeled on the canonical

path space (, F , (Ft)) of W = (W 1, W 2). In the remainder of this section, all RadonNikodym densities will be understood in the sense of the Lebesgue decomposition unless

otherwise mentioned.

Lemma 3.3 For every P  P there exists some   M such that

t

n = inf t  0

is a localizing sequence for P , and the positive local P-martingale

(14)

Zt := E - (Ys) dWs1 - s dWs2 t

(15)

is P-a.s. equal to the density dP /dP|Ft. Conversely, let   M be given. Then there exists a localized martingale measure P such that dP /dP|Ft is P-a.s. equal to Zt and such that n defined via (14) is a localizing sequence.

11

Proof: For P  P the density process Zt, understood in the sense of the Lebesgue
decomposition, is a strictly positive local P-martingale and can be represented P-a.s. as
Zt = E(- µs dWs1 - s dWs2) for certain µ,   M. This follows as in the proof of Lemma 3.1. The condition that ZS/S0 is a local P-martingale determines µt as (Yt) dt  dP-a.s. and in turn yields Z = Z. Hence, when defining n as in (14), Zn is P-a.s.
strictly positive and satisfies E[ Zn ] = 1, and this implies that P  P on Fn. Therefore,
(n) is a localizing sequence for P . Conversely, let   M be given, and define Z as in the assertion. Then Z is a
strictly positive local P-martingale and ZS/S0 is a local P-martingale. Defining n as in (14) yields that Zn is the density of a probability measure P n, which is equivalent to P. Moreover, (Zn)n=1,2,... is a discrete-time P-martingale, and so P n+1 coincides with P n on Fn. Hence, the Kolmogorov consistency theorem yields the existence of a probability measure P on F =  n Fn whose restrictions to Fn are equal to P n. Finally, it is well known that limn Ztn = limn dP /dP|Ftn is P-a.s. equal to the density dP /dP on ( n Ftn) = Ft, that is, Zt = dP /dP|cFt.

Combining this fact with (16) and monotone convergence yields the second identity in the assertion.

4 Formulation of the dual problem

In this section, we will first apply results from Schied [22] in preparation for the application
of stochastic control techniques. To check for the applicability of the results in [22], note first that our utility function (8) belongs to C1, is increasing and strictly concave, and satisfies the Inada conditions U (0+) =  and U (-) = 0. It also has asymptotic elasticity AE(U ) = lim supx xU (x)/U (x) = 0 < 1. The following lemma states that the penalty function  satisfies [22, Assumption 2.1], which is needed for the applicability
of the duality results in [22].

Lemma 4.1 The penalty function (Q) defined in (4) is the minimal penalty function of the convex risk measure

(X) := sup EQ[ -X ] - (Q) ,
QP
that is,  satisfies the biduality relation

(Q) = inf X L

EQ[ -X ] - (X) ,

Moreover,  is continuous from below on L(P).

Q  P.

Proof: By the biduality theorem and the general representation theory for convex risk measures on L(P) as described in [9],  will be identified as the minimal penalty function
of  once we have shown that it is convex and lower semicontinuous for the strong (and hence the weak) topology on L1(P).
We first show convexity. Take Q, Q  P such that both (Q) and (Q) are finite and let Q := Q + (1 - )Q for   [0, 1]. To this end, suppose that  and  are two
progressive processes associated via (12) and (13) with Q and Q, respectively. Let Dt and Dt denote the corresponding density processes. Since

T

Dt|t|2 dt - T 2

due to (5), we have Dt|t| <  dt  dP-a.e., and so we can define the process

We use next that (x, y)  xh(y/x) is a convex function on (0, ) × [0, ); see, e.g., [23, Equation (21)]. Hence,

T
EQ h(t) dt  (Q) + (1 - )(Q) < ,

Next, we will show the lower semicontinuity of  for L1-convergence. To this end,

let DTn := dQn/dP be a sequence of probability densities converging to DT := dQ/dP

in L1(P). Then suptT |Dtn - Dt|  0 in P-probability. A localization argument then

shows that the sequence

It follows that dQ-measure to

the process  associated with Q. Fatou's lemma now yields lim infn (Qn)  (Q).

Let us now show that  is continuous from below. Due to our coercivity assumption

(5), we have (Q) + 2  21H(Q|P) = 21E

for Q  P. Hence, the level sets

are uniformly integrable. Therefore continuity from below follows from

[17, Lemma 2] together with [9, Corollary 4.35] and the Dunford-Pettis theorem.

Remark 4.2 Given the preceding lemma, it follows from [22, Theorem 2.4] that the value function u of the primal problem satisfies

u(x) = sup inf A QP

EQ[ log XTx, ] + (Q)

= inf sup QP A

EQ[ log XTx, ] + (Q) .

Due to (6), one might thus guess that

if  is associated with Q  P via (12) and (13). Moreover, this argument suggests that the optimal strategy for Q is given by

tQ

=

1t + (Yt) (Yt)

.

(18)

Minimizing over Q  P would then formally yield the HJB equation (9) for our value function. There are, however, some subtleties associated with this approach. First of all, one needs a proper localization argument to justify (17). While this localization argument can be carried out via similar arguments as those in Lemma 3.4, another difficulty arises from the fact that the strategy in (18) is defined Q-a.s. only. Therefore one would have to check whether it can be extended to a P-a.s. defined strategy in A. In fact, if a strategy is admissible under some Q  P but not under P itself it may be an arbitrage opportunity in the model Q; see [23, Example 2.5]. For these reasons, we do not pursue further the control approach on the primal problem and work on the dual problem instead.

14

It follows from [22, Theorems 2.4 and 2.6] that the dual value function of the robust utility maximization problem is given as

u() := inf inf M QP

E

DTQU

ZT DTQST0

+ (Q) ,

(19)

where U (z) = supx0(U (x)-zx) is the Fenchel-Legendre transform of the convex function -U (-x). Due to [22, Theorem 2.4], the primal value function

u(x) = sup inf A QP

EQ[ log XTx, ] + (Q)

can then be obtained as

u(x) = min(u() + x). >0

(20)

In our specific setting (8), we have U (z) = - log z - 1. Thus, we can simplify the duality formula (20) as follows. First, the expectation in (19) can be computed as

E

Hence,

Lemma 4.3 For Q  P such that (Q) < , we have Q,0 < . In particular, condition (12) in [22] is satisfied.

Proof: Our conditions on h yield that 1H(Q|P)  (Q) + 2 < . Let P  be the equivalent local martingale measure defined by dP /dP = ZT0 . Then

Using again (Q) <  one sees that the last term is finite, and this implies the assertion.

Due to the preceding lemma, we may now apply [22, Theorem 2.6]. It yields that,

if the pair (Q, ) minimizes (19), then there exists an optimal strategy   A, whose

terminal wealth is given by

XTx, = I

(21)

where I(y) := -U (y) = log y + 1 and  > 0 minimizes (20).

5 HJB approach to the dual problem

In this section, we will describe the dual problem by stochastic control techniques. Our aim is to maximize Q, over Q  Q and   M. Let us first heuristically derive the HJB equation for the dual problem; a rigorous argument will be provided at a later stage. To this end, we will use Lemma 3.1 to write the density process of Q  P as

Dt = E

s dWs t

Q-a.s.

and denote by N the set of all processes  arising in this way. Note that the stochastic
exponential need not be not defined under P if Q is not equivalent to P. We will use both   N and   M as control processes. Let us write (Yty)t0 to indicate the starting point y = Y0y of the solution to the SDE (3). We then introduce the function

J(t, y, , ) := E

Dt

log

Dt St0 Zt

t
+ E Dt h(s) ds ,
0

where Z and S0 depend on y via Y y. In particular, J(T, Y0, , ) = Q, + (Q). Our aim is to study the value function

V (t, y) := inf inf J(t, y, , ). N M

Remark 5.1 The process dW () := dWt +t dt is a two-dimensional Q-Brownian motion. Hence, if the processes  and  are sufficiently bounded, then their stochastic integrals with respect to W () are Q-martingales, and we get

J(t, y, , ) = EQ

Under Q, the process Y y follows an SDE of the form

dYty = g(Yty) dt + 1t dt + 2t dt + dWt(),

(22)

where W () is a one-dimensional Q-Brownian motion. Standard control theory now suggests that the function V is (formally) a solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation

The preceding heuristic argument is made precise by the following verification result.

Proposition 5.2 (Verification result) Suppose the PDE (24)­(23) admits a classical solution v  C1,2((0, T ) × R)  C([0, T ] × R) satisfying a polynomial growth condition in y and suppose that one of the following three conditions is satisfied:
(a) dom h is bounded;

(b) vy is bounded;
(c) (y, ·) satisfies a radial growth condition in direction (, ), uniformly in y, and vy satisfies p- y; vy(t, y)  p+ y; vy(t, y)  C1(1 + |y|)
for some constant C1.
Then v = V . Suppose furthermore that  : [0, T ] × R  R is a measurable function realizing the infimum in (24). Then t := (T - t, Yt) belongs to the set N , t := -2t belongs to M, and we have V (T, y) = J(T, y, , ).

Proof: Let   M and   N be control processes such that J(t, y, , ) <  and consider the localized martingale measure P associated with  and let   N be associated to Q  P. Then

J(t, y, , ) = EQ

Dt Zt

The control process  occurs only in the first term on the right, which according to Lemma

and s() := 0 otherwise. Thus, we arrive at

Due to (22), we have under Q that

dt (26)

where we have used (24) in the latter inequality. Letting n := inf{t  0 | |Yty|  n}, by the continuity of vy and the boundedness of the process Yty for 0  t  n, we get

v(u, y)  EQ

un 1 02

1t + (Yty) 2 + r(Yty) + h(t) dt + v(u - u  n, Yuyn)

.

(27)

17

Since n   Q-a.s., we obtain v(u, y)  J(u, y, ) and in turn v  V . Here we have also used the initial condition v(0, ·) = 0, the fact that r is bounded, and the assumption that v satisfies a polynomial growth condition in y together with dominated convergence and Theorem 4.7 in [19], which states that

sup E exp{|Yt|2} < 
0tT

for some  > 0.

(28)

Now we shall prove the reverse inequality. The coercivity condition (5) and the lower semicontinuity of h(·) imply that for each t and y there exists

(t, y)  arg min
R2

(1

+

2 )vy (t,

y)

+

1 2

(1

+

(y))2

+

h()

.

By a measurable selection argument, (t, y) can be chosen as a measurable function of t and y. To prove that ^s := (u - s, Ys) is an admissible Markov control, i.e., ^  N , we need to verify that

Dt^ := E

^1s dWs1 +

^2s dWs2

,
t

0  t  u,

is a P-martingale. Once this has been proved, we get an equality in (26) and hence in

(27). According to Liptser and Shiryayev [19], p.220, D^ is a martingale if we can show that

for some  > 0

sup E exp{|^t|2} < .
0tu

(29)

This is clear when dom h is bounded or when vy is bounded, i.e., under conditions (a) or (b). Assuming condition (c), note that (t, y) belongs in fact to the supergradient

of x  (y, x) at x = (, )vy(t, y). Hence, the radial growth condition together with the estimate on p±(y; vy(t, y)) implies that |(t, y)|  c(1 + |y|) for some constant c. Therefore (29) now follows from (28).

Proof of Theorem 2.1: If dom h is compact, we can restrict the infimum in (24) to controls  in the compact set dom h, and Theorem IV.4.3 and Remark IV.3.3 in [7] yield the existence of a classical solution v to the PDE (24)­(23) satisfying a polynomial growth condition. Thus, condition (a) of Proposition 5.2 is satisfied, and we get the identification v = V . The form of the optimal strategy  and the fact that (Q, ) is a saddlepoint follow immediately from (6), (21), and the results in [22].

6 Existence of a classical solution for a noncompact control domain
In this section, we will derive existence results for the PDE (24)­(23) in case of a noncompact effective domain dom h. We will need the following estimate.

18

Proof: To obtain the lower bound, note that by (25)

= inf E

To prove the upper bound, take a process  such that V (t, y)   + J(t, y, ) and s = 0 for s  [t, t + ]. It follows that

which gives the upper bound.

For n  N, let us introduce the auxiliary functions

h() if h()  n, hn() := + otherwise.

Then hn also satisfies the assumptions made on h, and its effective domain dom hn is compact. Thus, according to Theorem 2.1 and its proof, the value function V n obtained by replacing h with hn coincides with the unique bounded classical solution vn of the corresponding HJB equation. Based in the preceding lemma we now deduce an estimate on the growth of the gradients vyn.
Lemma 6.2 Suppose first that p  (y; p) has superlinear growth. Then for every R > 0 there exist CR > 0 and n0  N, both depending only on R, T , and the model parameters, such that |vyn(t, y)|  CR whenever n  n0, |y|  R, and 0 < t < T .
If, alternatively, g is bounded and (11) holds, then n0 can be chosen independently of R, and vyn(t, y) can be bounded uniformly for n  n0, t  (0, T ), and y  R.

19

Proof: Let R > 0 be given. Recall from Lemma 6.1 that -K  vn(t, y)  K for some constant K depending only on the model parameters and T . Therefore, due to the mean value theorem, there exist y+n  (R, R + 1) and y-n  (-R - 1, -R) such that

|vyn(t, y±n )|  2K.

If |vyn(t, ·)| exceeds 2K in (y-n , y+n ), and hence in [-R, R], this implies the existence of a local maximum of the continuous function |vyn(t, ·)|. Hence, it is enough to estimate |vyn(t, y)| in critical points y of vyn(t, ·), which are located in [-R - 1, R + 1]. In such points y, vn satisfies the equation

vtn = n(vyn) + gvyn + r,

(30)

where n corresponds to hn. Due to Lemma 6.1, the left-hand side is bounded in absolute value by K+ - K-. Next, let cR be an upper bound for |g(y)| when |y|  R + 1. Due to the superlinear growth assumption on p  (y; p), there exists some n0 such that

lim inf
|p|

n(y; p) p

 cR + 1

for n  n0 and all y.

(31)

But in view of (30) and the uniform bound on vtn, this clearly implies a uniform bound of the form |vyn(t, y)|  c0 whenever n  n0, 0  t  T , and y is a critical point of vyn with |y|  R + 1. Taking CR := c0  (2K) yields the first part of the result.
If g is bounded and (11), then cR can be chosen independently of R, and (31) holds
with cR + /2 instead of cR + 1, where  is taken from (11).

Note that the functions vn decrease pointwise to a function v, which also satisfies the bounds
tK-  v(t, y)  tK+.

Lemma 6.3 Suppose that p  (y; p) has superlinear growth or g is bounded and (11)

holds. Then, for any   (0, 1), v(t, y) = limn vn(t, y) is a bounded classical solution in

(32)

Moreover, |vt(t, y)|  K+ - K-.

Proof: Take R > 0 and let CR be as in Lemma 6.2. Note then that for |p|  CR there exists some n1 such that n(y; p) = (y; p) for n  n1 and all y. Hence, Lemma 6.2 yields that for n  n0  n1 and |y|  R

r.

(33)

Since the terms vtn, (vyn), gvyn, and r are uniformly bounded, the same must be true of vyny. Hence, the Arzela-Ascoli theorem yields the existence of a subsequence (nk) such that

20

vynk converges locally uniformly in C([0, T ] × R) to some function w, and the pointwise convergence of vnk(t, y) implies that w is equal to the y-derivative vy of v. Moreover, the
uniform bounds on vtn and vyny imply that vy is locally Lipschitz continuous on [0, T ] × R. In particular, v belongs to W21,,l1oc([0, T ] × R) and satisfies |vt(t, y)|  K+ - K-.
Taking   C((0, T ) × R) and writing (33) in integral form yields

where the free term f is equal to (vy) + r and satisfies a local Lipschitz condition in

[18])

we

conclude

that

  (0, 1). The fact that v solves (32) is now obvious.

Proof of Theorem 2.3: It follows from Lemma 6.2, Lemma 6.3, and its proof that there exists a bounded classical solution v with a bounded gradient vy. Hence, Proposition 5.2 (b) applies, and the first part of Theorem 2.3 follows. The part on Q and  follows as in Theorem 2.1.

The application of our verification result in Proposition 5.2 requires a growth condition on the gradient of v.

Lemma 6.4 Suppose that p  (y; p) has superlinear growth. Then there exists a constant C1, depending only on T and the model parameters, such that

p- y; vy(t, y)  p+ y; vy(t, y)  C1(1 + |y|).

Proof: The C2-function y  v(t, y) is bounded from above and below by the two

constants T K+ and T K-, which are independent of t  T . Therefore, the function

y  |vy(t, y)| cannot increase to its supremum, and we conclude that it is enough to

estimate |vy(t, y)| in such points y that are critical points of vy(t, ·). In these points y,

vyy(t, y) vanishes, and we obtain vt = (vy) + gvy + r. Dividing by |vy|, we hence get that

for |vy|  1

 y; vy(t, y) vy(t, y)

 K+ - K- + |g(0)| + g |y| + r .

and the right-hand side can be bounded by c1(1 + |y|) for an appropriate constant c1. The coercivity condition (5) implies that the concave function p  (y; p) grows at

most quadratically as |p|  . Hence, there are constants p0, c2  1 such that

|p+(p)|  |p-(p)|  c2|p+(p/2)|  |p-(p/2)| for |p|  p0.

21

Next, choose p1 such that (y; p)  0 and p-(y; p)  0 for p  p1/2. Such a p1 exists due to concavity. Then we obtain that for p  p0  p1

1 p

|p+(p/2)|

|p+(p)|.

An analogous inequality holds for p less than some p2  0 and p-. Putting everything together yields the assertion.

Proof of Theorem 2.5: From Lemma 6.3 we know that there exists a classical solution v to the equation (13). Lemma 6.4 gives the conditions to apply part (c) of Proposition 5.2. This proposition then implies the uniqueness of v, while the rest of the theorem follows as before.
