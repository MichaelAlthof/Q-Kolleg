Abstract
The volatility implied by observed market prices as a function of the strike and time to maturity form an Implied Volatility Surface (IV S). Practical applications require reducing the dimension and characterize its dynamics through a small number of factors. Such dimension reduction is summarized by a Dynamic Semiparametric Factor Model (DSF M ) that characterizes the IV S itself and their movements across time by a multivariate time series of factor loadings. This paper focuses on investigating long range dependence in the factor loadings series. Our result reveals that shocks to volatility persist for a very long time, affecting significantly stock prices. For appropriate representation of the series dynamics and the possibility of improved forecasting, we model the long memory in levels and absolute returns using the class of fractional integrated volatility models that provide flexible structure to capture the slow decaying autocorrelation function reasonably well.

1 Introduction

As a measure of the standard deviation of the daily range of price movements, volatility is an important determinant of the riskiness of an asset, a crucial parameter in derivative pricing such as options. Findings across several asset markets have reported high persistence of volatility shocks and that over sufficiently long periods of time, volatility is typically stationary with "mean reverting" behavior, Bollerslev and Jubinski (1999). Such series are characterized by distinct but nonperiodic cyclical patterns and their behavior is such that current values are not only influenced by immediate past values but values from previous time periods, allowing for persistence or long memory. Long memory describes the correlation structure of a series at long lags.

It is well known that the volatility implied by observed option prices as a function of the strike and time to maturity form an Implied Volatility Surface (IV S). For each day the IV S forms a high dimensional object that has unknown stochastic behavior that needs to be analyzed. For practical applications such as in risk management, it is desirable to reduce the dimension of this object and characterize its dynamics through a small number of factors. Such dimension reduction may be summarized by a Dynamic Semiparametric Factor Models (DSF M ) that characterize the IV S and their movements across time by a multivariate time series of factor loadings, Borak et al. (2005), Fengler et al. (2007) and Borak et al. (2007).

The DSF M s approximate the implied volatility surface by regressing log-

implied volatility on a two-dimensional covariate containing moneyness and

time-to-maturity. To introduce this model, denote by Yt,j = log {^t,j(,  )},

the log-implied volatility where t = 1, . . . , I is an index of time, in this case

the number of the day, and j = 1, . . . , Jt is the number of IV observations on day t. Let Xt,j = (t,j, t,j) be a two-dimensional covariate where t,j is a

moneyness matrix and t,j denotes time-to-maturity. Moneyness is defined as

t,j

=

Kt,j Ft,j

where

Kt,j

is

a

strike and Ft,j

= S et (rt,j ,t,j )

the

underlying

futures

price belonging to the option trade (t, j). The model is expressed as:

K
Yt,j = zt,kmk(Xt,j) + t,j
k=0

(1)

where zt,0 = 1, mk are smooth basis functions (k = 0, . . . , K) and zt,k are time dependent weights or factor loadings. The IV S is assumed to be a weighted sum of the smooth functional factors, mk and its dynamics is explained by

2

the stochastic behavior of the factor loadings, zt,k. Approximations of the factor loadings are obtained by fitting model (1) to the implied volatility observations and the functions mk are estimated by orthogonal series estimators so that they have zero correlations among each other, Borak et al. (2005). The factor loadings zt = (zt,1, . . . , zt,K) forms an unobserved multivariate time series.

The estimates zt,k and mk are obtained in (1) as minimizers of the following least squares criterion:

I Jt t=1 j=1

K
Yt,j - zt,kmk
k=0

2
Kh(u - Xt,j) du,

(2)

where Kh denotes a two-dimension kernel function, chosen as a product of one-dimensional kernels Kh(u) = kh1(u1) ◊ kh2(u2), where h = (h1, h2) are bandwidths and kh(v) = k(h-1v)/h is a one-dimensional kernel function. The minimization procedure is iterative, searching through all functions mk : R2 - R (k = 0, ..., K) and time series ztk  R (t = 1, ..., I; k = 1, ..., K). The estimation procedure can be seen as a combination of functional princi-
pal component analysis, nonparametric curve estimation and backfitting for
additive models. The DSF M therefore simultaneously estimate the factor
functions and fits the surface.

This paper applies the DSF M on the German DAX index market from 04.01.1999 to 25.02.2003. Figure 1 displays the implied volatility surface from the DSF M fit for the DAX-Option on 2 May 2000, with moneyness between 0.8 and 1.12 and time to maturity between 0 and 0.5 years. Figure 2 shows three volatility-driving factors that could be interpreted in terms of level, slope and curvature factor. z1 governs movements in the general level, z2 is largely associated with changes in the slope and z3 is closely related to dynamic changes in the curvature of the IVS.

The aim of this paper is to investigate dependence in the factor loadings of implied volatility strings because information on persistence can guide the search for economic explanation of the movements in asset returns as well as in risk management applications. Several research involving the autocorrelation functions of various volatility measures (squared, log-squared and absolute returns) have reported decay at a very slow mean-reverting hyperbolic rate, Ding et al. (1993), Bollerslev and Wright (2000) and Sibbertsen (2004). Our analysis follow this line of research on long range dependence investigation and modeling.

First, we consider model independent tests for stationarity, I(0) against fractional alternatives I(d). We apply the rescaled variance test (V /S) of Giraitis et al. (1999) that uses the heteroscedastic and autocorrelation consistent (HAC) estimator of the variance, Newey and West (1987) for normalization and the semiparametric (LobRob) test of Lobato and Robinson (1998), that does not depend on a specific parametric form of the spectrum in the neighborhood of the zero frequency. We also apply the log-periodogram regression estimator (GP H) of Geweke and Porter-Hudak (1983) and the Gaussian Semiparametric estimator (GSP ) of Robinson (1995a) in estimating the degree of long memory in the factor loadings series. Results are indicative of long-range dependence in the factor loadings series in levels and absolute returns. The first factor, z1 can be interpreted as highly persistent and influences all options similarly, irrespective of maturity. The second factor z2 gradually diminishes for longer maturities and the third factor z3 governs large volatility changes in relatively short maturities.
Second, for appropriate representation of the series dynamics and the possibility of improved forecasting, we model long memory in volatility using the ARF IM A, F IGARCH and HY GARCH models. These models provide flexible structure that captures slow decaying autocorrelation reasonably well. In comparison, models in absolute returns have better performance, confirming the findings of Ding et al. (1993), that absolute returns are most appropriate indicator to represent the long memory volatility processes. Our results imply that shocks to the volatility will persist for long time, affecting the DAX stock prices significantly.
Such dependence or persistence will have importance economic consequences for short-term trading and long range investment strategies. Better option pricing may results from models that price and hedge derivative securities when there is prior information on long-memory volatility in terms of expectation on the potential level of volatility and the rate at which volatility changes. In the presence of long memory, Granger and Joyeux (1980), Geweke and Porter-Hudak (1983) have shown the possibility for improved price forecasting performance within a linear time series framework than with traditional procedures. Option pricing have also been shown to be significantly different when standard models are applied as compared to models allowing for long memory.
By applying the GARCH, EGARCH, F IEGARCH and IEGARCH models, Bollerslev and Mikkelsen (1996) have shown that the price of an option increases with the degree of integration. This means that GARCH models give the lowest price whereas the highest option price is obtained
5

for the IGARCH model. For long memory alternative, Herzberg and Sibbertsen (2004) have shown that prices for the F IGARCH, HY GARCH are inbetween the GARCH and IGARCH prices. In addition to documented studies of the economic implications of long memory, Cheung and Lai (1995), Wilson and Okunev (1999), revealed that portfolio diversification decisions in the case of strategic asset allocation may become extremely sensitive to the investment horizon. There may be diversification benefits in the short and medium term, but not if the assets are held together over the long term if long memory is present. e.g., in a market that exhibits antipersistence, asset prices tend to reverse its trend in the short term thus creating short-term trading opportunities. In addition Mandelbrot (1971) has shown that in the presence of long memory the arrival of new market information cannot be fully arbitraged away. It is also known that the possibility of speculative profits as a result of superior long-range dependence model forecast would cast doubt on the basic tenets of market efficiency.
Motivated by evidence of long range dependence in the factor loadings levels and absolute returns, we perform estimation and prediction using the ARF IM A, F IGARCH and HY GARCH models that are known to provide flexible structure to capture slow decaying autocorrelation reasonably well than with traditional ARM A procedures.
The rest of our work is structured as follows. Section 2, introduces fractional integration and Long-memory processes. Here we examine some methodology for testing and estimating long range dependence that we apply in our analysis. Section 3 introduces the structure of the class of models we apply to analyze the long memory in the factor loading series. In section 4 we report and discuss our results for the series in levels and absolute returns. A summary of our analysis results and conclusions is given in section 5.

2 Fractional integration and long-memory

The framework of fractional integration yields convenient modeling of long range dependence, Granger and Joyeux (1980), Baillie (1996). A time series process zt is integrated of order d, I(d) if

(1 - L)dzt = t

(3)

where t  I(0) and L is the lag operator (Lzt = zt-1). The non-integer

parameter d is the difference parameter and (1 - L)d is the fractional filter

defined by its binomial expansion (1-L)d =

 j=0

(j-d) (-d)(j+1)

C k2d-1

(4)

for d in the range of (0, 0.5), where C is a strictly positive constant. In such case zt is said to exhibit long memory. For 0 < d < 0.5, the series is stationary. For d = 0, the series is an I(0) process and said to have no long-memory. For 0.5 < d < 1 the process is mean reverting as there is no long run impact of an innovation to future values of the process. In the case where 0 < d < 1, not only the immediate past value of zt influence the current value, but also values from previous time periods as well. The sum over the autocorrelation does not converge, so that it is a suitable model for long memory, Granger and Joyeux (1980).

2.1 Tests and estimators of long memory processes

We consider two model independent tests for stationarity, I(0) against fractional alternatives I(d). The tests include the rescaled variance test (V /S) of Giraitis et al. (1999) that uses the heteroscedastic and autocorrelation consistent (HAC) estimator of the variance, Newey and West (1987) for normalization and the semiparametric (LobRob) test of Lobato and Robinson (1998), that does not depend on a specific parametric form of the spectrum in the neighborhood of the zero frequency.
The Rescaled Variance test is applied by centering the KP SS statistic based on the partial sum of the deviations from the mean:

^j, is the heteroscedastic and autocorrelation

that this statistic can detect long range dependence in the volatility for the

class of ARCH() processes.

The Semiparametric test is based on the approximation of the spec-

trum of a long memory process. This test allows to discriminate between

d > 0 and d < 0. In the univariate case the test statistic for I(0) against

with bandwidth parameter m. Under the null hypothesis the test statistic is

asymptotically normally distributed. If the statistic is in the lower fractile of

the standardized normal distribution, the series exhibit long-memory whilst

if in the upper fractile of that distribution, the series is antipersistent.

To estimate the memory parameter d, we apply two frequently used estimators, the log-periodogram regression estimator (GP H) of Geweke and Porter-Hudak (1983) and the Gaussian Semiparametric estimator (GSP ) of Robinson (1995a).

The log-periodogram regression estimator is based on the periodogram of a time series zt, (t = 1, . . . , T ) defined by

and the variable Xj = log 4 sin2(j/2) :

dGP H = -

(the

with j  (l, m], where l is a trimming parameter discarding the lowest fre-

quencies and m is a bandwidth parameter. The cut-off parameter ensures

robustness of the estimator. For the Gaussian case with d  (-0.5, 0.5),

theestimator is consistent and asymptotically normal with standard error of / 24m, Robinson (1995b).

Validity of the GP H estimator for an enlarged interval has been demonstrated by Velasco (1999). More precisely, he shows that in the interval

8

[0.5, 0.75), where the time series is nonstationary, asymptotic Normality and consistency is preserved as in the original interval (-0.5, 0.5), while for values of d in the interval [0.75, 1) the estimator is still consistent. Deo and Hurvich (2001) have shown that this estimator is also valid for some non-Gaussian time series.

The Gaussian Semiparametric estimator is based on the approxi-

mation, limi0+ f (i) = Ci-2d of a long memory process in the Whittle

approximate maximum likelihood estimator, LW ().

Robinson (1995a) showed that m(d^GSP - d) d N (0, 1/4) and is valid in the presence of some form of conditional heteroscedasticity, Robinson and

Henry (1999). In general, Phillips and Shimotsu (2004) have shown that the

ranges of consistency and asymptotic normality for the model type in (3) are

thesame as those of the GP H estimator.

3 Long Memory Models
Several studies have dealt with models that provide useful ways of analyzing the relationships between the conditional mean and variance of a process ex-
9

hibiting long memory and slow decay in its levels. In our analysis we consider an autoregressive fractional integrated moving average (ARF IM A) process model, Granger and Joyeux (1980), Hosking (1981), the (F IGARCH), Baillie et al. (1996), a combination of fractional integrated process for the mean with regular GARCH process for conditional variance and the HYperbolic GARCH, (HY GARCH) of Davidson (2004).

The ARFIMA(p,d,q) model represented as

(L)(1 - L)d(zt - µ) = (L)t

(11)

where t  i.i.d(0, 2) extends the integration order of the conventional ARM A model to a non-integer value between 0 and 1. (L) = 1 - 1L - 2L2 - ∑ ∑ ∑ - pLp and (L) = 1 + 1L + 2L2 + ∑ ∑ ∑ + qLq are the autoregressive and moving average polynomials in the lag operator L respectively. d is the long memory parameter and (1 - L)d is the fractional difference filter
as defined in equation 3. The ARF IM A process displays persistence for
0 < d < 0.5 and anti-persistence for -0.5 < d < 0. For |d| > 0.5, the process
is non-stationary as it has finite variance.

In our application, the values for p and q are chosen such that the ordered pair (p, q) minimizes the AIC criterion. We estimate the model parameters µ, ,  and d by maximum likelihood approach of Doornik and Ooms (2004) that allows for (break-) regressors in the mean and structural changes in the variance, and by non-linear least squares estimation method of Beran (1994) that is asymptotically efficient in the presence of GARCH errors.

The FIGARCH(p,,q) model of Baillie et al. (1996) given as

(L)(1 - L)d2t =  + (L)t

(12)

where t = t2 - t2 combine the fractional integrated process for the mean with regular GARCH process for the conditional variance. The conditional
variance can be represented as

t2

=

1

 - (L)

+

1 - (L)(1 - L) 1 - (L)

2t

(13)

with 0    1. The  in F IGARCH does not have the same interpretation of persistence as d in ARF IM A. The fractional differencing operator in the ARF IM A model applies to the constant term in the mean equation while in F IGARCH it does not apply to  in the variance equation. We base our analyis on the F IGARCH parametrization proposed by Chung (1999),

(L)(1 - L)d(t2 - 2) = (L)(t2 - 2)

(14)

10

where 2 is the unconditional variance of t. The conditional variance is formulated as

t2 = 2 +

1 - (L)(1 - L) 1 - (L)

(t2 - 2)

(15)

For p = q = 1, Chung (1999) shows that 2 > 0 and 0  1  1  1 is a sufficient condition for positive t2. When  = 0 or 1, the F IGARCH model nests the GARCH(p, q) and IGARCH processes respectively. The
IGARCH model is a short memory process having no variance and while
the F IGARCH has shortest memory with  > 0 closest to 1. If  > 0
the F IGARCH is a non-stationary long memory process, otherwise is a
stationary long memory process, Laurent and Peters (2002). The fractional
difference filter is defied by,

The hyperbolic GARCH model, HYGARCH(p,,d,q) of Davidson (2004) extends the conditional variance of the F IGARCH(p, , q) model by introducing weights to the difference operator in equation 12 such that (1 - L)d = (1 - ) + (1 - L)d . The parametrization of HY GARCH(p, , d, q) models is given by

where  are weights to (1 - L)d. The parameters  and d are assumed positive. The HY GARCH(p, , d, q) nest GARCH models (for  = 0), IGARCH (for  = d = 1) and F IGARCH (for  = 1 or log  = 0). When  < 1 (log  < 0) the process is stationary.

4 Empirical Analysis

The factor loadings series data are obtained from DSFM for implied volatility on the German DAX index market from January 1999 to February 2003 (data available at, http://sfb649.wiwi.hu-berlin.de/fedc). Table 1 presents descriptive statistics. Plots of sample autocorrelation functions, spectrum and periodogram (on log-log plane) are shown in Figure 3. The autocorrelation are positive and decay hyperbolically to zero as the lag increases. A linear relationship in the periodogram on log-log plane indicates the presence of self-similarities, the fluctuations in a power-law fashion. Figure 4 shows time series plots in absolute returns of three factor loadings series.

Since unit root tests are known to perform relatively poorly in distinguishing between I(1) and the I(d) alternatives for d < 1, Diebold and Rudebusch (1991), we apply model independent tests, V /S and LobRob for I(0) against I(d) alternatives. With no data driven guideline for the choice of truncation lags m, we use different values (m = 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, 50) in the V /S test and (m = 30, 50, 150, 200, 300) in LobRob test.

Results in Tables 2 and 3 for the V /S and LobRob tests respectively indicate long-range dependence in all three factor loadings levels. For absolute returns, the tests indicate long momory in |z1| and |z3| while antipersistence could not be rejected in |z2|. Both tests results reject long memory for all factor loadings returns.

Table 4 shows the d^GP H and d^GSP estimates of d for the series in levels,

returns and absolute returns. To evaluate the sensitivity of results for the

d^GP H estimator, we report estimates of d for bandwidth m = T  where

 = 0.5, 0.525, 0.575, 0.60, 0.80 and T = 1052 is the sample size. For the

GSP

estimator

the

such

that

m

=

[

T 4

],

[

T 8

],

[

T 16

],

[

T 32

],

[

T 64

].

Results for series in levels show 0.5  d < 1; for the return series most

estimates from d^GP H and d^GSP are in -0.5  d < 0 while estimates of d for

the absolute returns are within 0  d < 0.5.

To guarantee that the long memory diagnosis is not a consequence of occasional or structural break such as the 11th September, 2001 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, we use subsamples of the data to examine whether long run dependencies can be uncovered, Anderson and Bollerslev (1998). This approach is possible given that the value of d is not affected by temporal aggregation, Bollerslev and Wright (2000). Results, not presented here indicate long memory for short span of the data in levels and absolute returns. This therefore suggest that long memory is an inherent

characteristics of the factor loading series.
To summarize, our analysis suggest long-range dependence in loading levels as well as in absolute returns for z1 and z3. In general no long memory in returns was detected and evidence of antipersistence in the absolute returns for z2 could not be ruled out. We therefore interpret that there is quite some correlation structure in the loadings in levels as well as in absolute returns. This implies some degree of persistence and the expectation of a slow decay in impulse responses. We also observe that the long range dependence is different for each factor loading such that it could be interpreted in terms of a long term, middle long term and short term impact on the dynamics of IV S. The first factor loading, z1 is highly persistent and influences all options similarly, irrespective of maturity. The impact of the second factor loading, z2 gradually diminishes for longer maturities, while the third factor governs large volatility changes in relatively short maturities.

4.1 Long Memory Models Application
For appropriate representation of the factor loadings series dynamics and the possibility of improved forecasting, we model the long memory in levels and absolute returns using the ARF IM A, F IGARCH and HY GARCH models. These models are known to describe volatility reasonably well and provide flexible structure that captures slow decaying autocorrelation functions. Estimation results with ARF IM A model for series in levels and absolute returns are reported in Tables 5 and 6 respectively. Estimates of d are highly significant across all time series in levels. The t-statistic are highly significant to reject the null hypothesis (H0 : d = 0) at 1% significance level. Results for absolute returns |z2| does confirm earlier tests results in that antipersitence in |z2| may not be rejected.
Estimation results for the F IGARCH(1, , 1) and HY GARCH(1, d, 1) models are reported in Tables 7 and 8 respectively. We assume the Student-t distribution because it can appropriately account for leptokurticity exhibited by high frequency financial data, Pagan (1996). Under student-t distributed innovations, the F IGARCH and HY GARCH long memory parameter es-

timates indicate long-memory in levels and absolute returns. Besides, the student-t distribution parameter,  are significantly different from zero, indicating strong fat tail phenomena. Estimates,  > 0 in F IGARCH models suggest non-stationary long memory characteristics in levels and absolute returns for the first and third factor loadings series, whereas the second series ( < 0) indicate a stationary long memory behavior. We assess models fit through the log-likelihood, Ln( ), the Akaike Information Criterion, (AIC) and the performance of the Box-Pierce (Q2) statistic for testing remaining serial correlation in the squared standardized residuals, McLeod and Li (1983).
The F IGARCH and HY GARCH models perform well in describing the high persistence existing in the conditional variance. The Q2(24) statistics suggests that the F IGARCH model can better capture the autocorrelations in the conditional variance for the series in levels while the HY GARCH is more appropriate in the case of absolute returns. The F IGARCH models report higher loglikelihood values for the series in levels while the HY GARCH values are higher for absolute returns. Moreover, models in absolute returns produce better fit than those in levels, which confirms the findings of Ding et al. (1993), that absolute returns are the most appropriate indicators to represent the long memory volatility processes.

We examine the in-sample fit of the ARF IM A model for the series in levels and absolute returns, Figure 5 as well as the conditional variance forecast in levels, Figure 6 and absolute returns, Figure 7 for the F IGARCH and HY GARCH models. Table 9 show in-sample forecast performance evaluated on the basis of the Root Mean Square Error (RM SE) and the Mean Absolute Prediction Error (M AP E). The main findings are that the F IGARCH and HY GARCH models show better forecast performance than the ARF IM A model and seems to successfully achieve the aim of modeling the long memory behavior of volatility in a parsimonious way.

5 Conclusion
We present an empirical investigation of long memory dynamics in the factors of Implied Volatility Strings. The factor loadings series are obtained by applying a Dynamic Semiparametric Factor Model (DSF M ) for implied volatility strings on the German DAX index market. Long range dependence in the factor loadings series is tested using the rescaled variance V /S and the semiparametric LobRob tests. We estimated the degree of long memory based on the log-periodogram GP H regression estimator and the GSP estimator based on the Whittle approximate maximum likelihood estimate. Results are indicative of long-range dependence in the factor loading series in levels and absolute returns. The factors can be interpreted in terms of a long term, middle long term and short term impact on the dynamics of IV S. The first factor loading, z1 is highly persistent and influences all options similarly, irrespective of maturity. The impact of the second factor loading, z2 gradually diminishes for longer maturities and the third factor governs large volatility changes in relatively short maturities. Such dependence or persistence has importance implications for short-term trading and long range investment strategies. As a consequence, hedging strategies of a long position should take into consideration the long-memory effects in a short position in a call option. This would certainly provide more secure protection against negative effects of long-range persistence in volatility. On the other hand, better results could be obtained for models that price and hedge derivative securities when there is prior information on long-memory volatility in terms of expectation on the potential level of volatility and the rate at which volatility changes.
For an appropriate representation of the series dynamics and the possibility of improved forecasting, we model the long memory in volatility via the class of flexible processes, the ARF IM A, F IGARCH and HY GARCH models. Our results indicate that these models appear to capture the slow decaying autocorrelation function and therefore are applicable in mimicking the dynamics of the factor loadings. In comparison, models in absolute returns have better performance, confirming the findings of Ding et al. (1993), that absolute returns are the most appropriate indicator to represent the long memory volatility processes. It would be interesting to find out if there are persistent time scales that are of local importance or influence the factor loading time series. Therefore, a possible extensions for future research would include studies on spectral analysis or wavelet transform to identify such persistent time scales. In addition, the resulting long range dependence and evidence of fat tail phenomenon also provides a natural extension to

investigate long memory value-at-risk. This would be useful to regulators, derivative market participants and practitioners whose interest is to reasonably forecast stock market movements.
