Abstract
Motivated by the conjectured existence of trends in the intensity of tropical storms, this paper proposes new inferential methodology to detect a trend in the annual pattern of environmental data. The new methodology can be applied to data which can be represented as annual curves which evolve from year to year. Other examples include annual temperature or log≠precipitation curves at specific locations. Within a framework of a functional regression model, we derive two tests of significance of the slope function, which can be viewed as the slope coefficient in the regression of the annual curves on year. One of the tests relies on a Monte Carlo distribution to compute the critical values, the other is pivotal with the chi≠ square limit distribution. Full asymptotic justification of both tests is provided. Their finite sample properties are investigated by a simulation study. Applied to tropical storm data, these tests show that there is a significant trend in the shape of the annual pattern of upper wind speed levels of hurricanes.

A great deal of research in environmental and climate sciences has been dedicated to detecting change points and trends in various time series, including those related to temperature, precipitation and wind speed. In a typical setting, a scalar time series

Most environmental and climate series exhibit a pronounced annual periodicity which must be removed, or otherwise accounted for, before statements on change≠points or trends can be inferred. Sometimes, it is difficult to approximate the periodic component by a Fourier expansion due to the irregular domain and amplitude of observations within a year. The data that motivate this work are tropical storm wind speed data, examples are shown in Figure 1. The onset and end of typhoon and hurricane seasons, as well as their intensity, can change from year to year. We therefore propose to treat the data available for a whole year as a single high≠dimensional data object and perform the change point and trend analyses on these objects rather than the scalar observations directly. Such an approach is now relatively well≠established in the field of functional data analysis (FDA), the monographs of Horva¥th and Kokoszka (2012) or Ferraty and Vieu (2006) contain many examples. Methodological foundations of FDA are addressed in Ramsay and Silverman (2005), its mathematical foundations in Hsing and Eubank (2015). While the amount of information available in the data is invariably reduced by various smoothing and dimension reduction methods, the most important and relevant features of the data come into focus. In the problems we study in this paper, we are interested in the evolution of the annual pattern of tropical storms strength over several decades, not in specific hourly measurements.
Our functional methodology is combined with recent advances in expectile curve estimation, see Appendix A. We thus focus not only on the average pattern but on change points and trends in annual curves which describe the behavior at various levels of wind speed. This is illustrated in Figure 1. The curves in the middle summarize the pattern of average wind speed. These curves will exhibit some evolution from year to year. The curves above them summarize the annual patterns of the highest speeds; they may exhibit a different evolution than the average curves. This issue is well≠known in climate research; typically trends in the averages are contrasted with trends in extremes. In our application, no modeling of extreme behavior is required, the expectile curves are within the range of the data points. They provide information of behavior which lies between the typical behavior and the unobservable extreme behavior. Following the work of Smith (1989), evaluation of trends in extremes has attracted a great deal of attention, with respect to change point analysis of extremes, we are aware only of the work of Dierckx and Teugels (2010).
The data objects that this paper studies have the form Xn(t), where n refers to year, and t to time within the year. In the framework of functional data analysis, t is viewed as a continuous argument. The data are observed at a regular or irregular grid, but are converted to functional objects by means of various basis expansions which are defined for every t. We consider a sequence of curves Xn(t,  ) for several expectile levels   (0, 1); these are similar to quantile levels. We are interested in detecting change points and trends in the functional time series X1(∑,  ), X2(∑,  ), . . . , XN (∑,  ). For this purpose, we use the existing change point test of Berkes et al. (2009) and develop two trend tests. No trend tests have presently been available for the data structure described above. These two tests form a methodological contribution to statistics, while the analysis of the expectile

curves of tropical storms provides an insight to climate science. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we review the test of Berkes et al. (2009)
and present the two trend tests. These tools are applied in Section 3 to the analysis of expectile curves. Three appendices contain, respectively, background on expectile curves, a simulation study, and the details of the asymptotic theory for the trend tests. All codes are available as Quantlets on Quantnet (2015).
2 Change point and trend tests
This section presents the significance tests that will be applied to tropical storm data in Section 3. The change point test described in Section 2.1 was derived by Berkes et al. (2009), it is also described in Chapter 6 of Horva¥th and Kokoszka (2012). Trend tests introduced in Section 2.2 are new; their derivation and full large sample justification are presented in Section C. In both inferential settings, we consider as sequence of curves Xn(t), t  [0, 1], n = 1, 2, . . . N . The index n can be identified with year, the index t with time within the year normalized to unit interval. The exposition that follows uses now fairly standard concepts of functional data analysis, including functional principal components (FPC's) and their empirical counterparts (EFPC's), see e.g. Chapter 3 of Horva¥th and Kokoszka (2012).

2.1 Change point test

In change point tests, the null hypothesis is that the mean function does not change with year:
H0 : EX1 = EX2 = . . . = EXN .
The specific value of the mean is not part of the null hypothesis. The alternative is that there are change points k1, k2, . . . , kM such that the means Xi are not the same in all segments (km -1, km ]. The theory and practice of change points tests have been described in many textbooks, e.g. Brodsky and Darkhovsky (1993), Cso®rgo and Horva¥th (1997), Chen and Gupta (2011), so we do not dwell on the background on move on to the description of the test of Berkes et al. (2009).
The test is based on the normalized differences of estimated mean functions:
k(N - k) Pk(t,  ) = N {µ^k(t,  ) - µ~k(t,  )} ,
where

k
µ^k(t,  ) = k-1 Xi(t,  ),
i=1

N

µ~k(t,  ) = (N - k)-1

Xi(t,  ).

i=k+1

Next, we compute the estimated functional principal components v^ of the curves Xn and calculate the scores

(2.1)

Xn(t) - XØN (t) v^j(t)dt.

The scores are calculated using the function pca.fd in the R package fda, see Chapter 7 of Ramsay et al. (2009). This function also produces estimated eigenvalues ^ and
the percentage of variance explained by the first d eigenvalues. We find the smallest d
such that 85% of the variance is explained and calculate the test statistic

For large N , the statistics Sd has approximately the same distribution as the random variable Kd whose critical values are given Table 1, see Horva¥th and Kokoszka (2012) for more details.

2.2 Trend tests

Suppose the functions Xn(t) follow the trend model

Xn(t) = (t) + (t)n + n(t)

in which the error functions n are iid and square integrable: E ||n||2 = E

The parameter functions ,  are assumed to be elements of the space L2 = L2([0, 1]), so technically,  = 0 means that (t) = 0 for almost all t.
A natural approach to testing is based on an estimator of . If this estimator is small for all t  [0, 1], there is not enough evidence to reject H0. The least squares estimator of  under H0 , cf. Section C, is given by

To describe its asymptotic dis-

c(t, s) = E[n(t)n(s)]. Denote by j, j = 1, 2, . . . the eigenvalues of c. Next, define the

residuals

(2.4)

^n(t) = Xn(t) - ^n(t) - ^n(t)n,

where

Theorem 2.1 is proven in Section C. The distribution of  can be approximated by the distribution of

This leads to the Monte Carlo test whose consistency is claimed in part (ii) of Theo-

rem 2.1. To implement the test, we generate a large number, say R = 104, of independent replications of N (the ^j are estimated only once, from the original sample). Denote
these replications by N,r, 1  r  R. The P≠value of the test is computed as the fraction

of the N,r which are greater than N (computed from the data).

It is also possible to develop a test similar to the test of Berkes et al. (2009) in the

sense that a limit distribution is independent of the distribution of the data. In fact, in

the trend model, the limit distribution is the usual chi≠square distribution. This is stated

in Theorem 2.2, in which we use the inner product notation

(2.12)

P TN > q()  1, as N  ,

where q() is the (1-)th quantile of the chi≠square distribution with q degrees of freedom.

Theorem 2.2 is proven in Section C. Observe that to establish the consistency, it is not enough to assume  = 0 in L2. Since
the statistic TN is based on projections on the first q EFPC's, we must assume that the slope function  is not orthogonal to the subspace spanned by the first q FPC's.

3 Application to typhoon and hurricane data
In this section we apply the tests of Section 2 to annual expectile curves of wind speed data. The data have the form Xn(ti), where the times ti are separated by six hours, and the index n stands for year. The value Xn(ti) is the wind speed in knots (1 kn = 0.5144 m/s). We work with two data sets: typhoons in the West Pacific area over the period 1946≠2010, and hurricanes across the North Atlantic basin over the period 1947-2011. Both datasets are accessible free of charge at the website of Unisys Weather Information, UNISYS (2015).
Since there are about 1,460 time points ti per year, we treat time 0  t  T within a year as continuous, and the observed curves as functional data. For each year n, we construct expectile curves Xn(t,  ), for  = 0.1, 0.2, . . . , 0.9. Examples of expectile curves we study are given in Figure 1. The index   (0, 1) has the following interpretation. If  = 0.5, the curve Xn(t,  ) describes the mean strength of tropical storms throughout the year. If  is close to 1, the curve Xn(t,  ) captures the annual pattern of highest wind speeds. If  is close to zero, it does the same for the lowest wind speeds. More details are provided in Appendix A.
3.1 Change point analysis
The results of the application of the change≠point test of Section 2.1 are shown in Table 2. For both data sets and at all levels  , the test rejects the null hypothesis that the mean pattern does not change. As explained in Appendix A, the construction of the expectile curves involves the selection of a smoothing parameter . Table 2 shows the results for  selected by the AIC criterion. To validate our conclusions, we performed the same analysis using  which is either twice or half of the  selected by AIC. In both cases, all empirical significance levels remained under 5%.

The change point test shows that for all expectile levels  , there are statistically significant changes in the annual pattern. It is instructive to complement the above inferential analysis by simple exploratory analysis that reveals some dependence on the level  .

of the normalized differences introduced in Section 2.1. The plot of Pn( ) against the year index n shows the magnitude of change of the mean function. We display such plots

in Figure 2. They show that the largest changes occur for the expectile levels  close to

one; there is more change when focusing on the highest wind speeds than on median or

lowest speeds.

The change point analysis above shows that the pattern of typhoon and hurricane wind

speeds cannot be treated as stable over the sample periods we study. In the next section,

we investigate if this instability can be attributed to systematic trends.

3.2 Trend analysis

We now apply the trend tests introduced in Section 2.2 to typhoon and hurricane expectile curves. In the Monte Carlo test based on Theorem 2.1, we use 104 replications of

8

the random variable N defined by (2.9). In the chi≠square test based on Theorem 2.2, we determine q as the smallest number which explains at least 85% of the variance of the residual curves ^n defined by (2.4). The results of the tests are presented in Tables 3 and 4.

Table 4: P≠values for the chi≠square trend test based on Theorem 2.2

For the typhoon data, none of the two tests finds evidence of a trend. For the Hurricane data, the Monte Carlo test based on Theorem 2.1 indicates the existence of a trend for expectile levels  = 0.6 - 0.9 while the chi≠square test of Theorem 2.2 for all  except  = 0.1. Simulations reported in Appendix B show that the chi≠square test tends to overreject for data generating processes (DGP's) of length and error structure similar to the tropical storm expectile curves. We therefore conclude that there is evidence for the existence of a trend for upper expectile functions of hurricane data. The estimated slope functions ^ are plotted in Figure 3.
We conclude the trend analysis by showing in Figure 5 the dependence on  of the norm
^ = ^2(t)dt of the estimated slope function. Even though there is statistical evi-
dence for nonzero slope function only for the upper expectiles of hurricane data, the exploratory analysis of the norms indicates that there is a very clear increasing dependence of the slope on  . Based on the estimates ^, the slope functions  appear to be much smaller for lower expectiles, and to detect them, if they are in fact nonzero, larger sample sizes N would be needed. There is not much difference between the size of ^, for typhoon and hurricane data, but the ^ for hurricanes show a clear pattern with positive mass around July and November, and negative mass in early Fall. For the typhoon curves the pattern of mass accumulation is spread more uniformly throughout the year, with a pronounced negative mass in November. The significance tests we developed provide a statistical justification for these fairly subtle visual differences.
3.3 Main conclusions of data analysis
The change point tests have shown that the annual pattern of wind speeds for both hurricanes and typhoons cannot be treated as constant, no matter what expectile level is

considered. The application of the new trend tests has focused on a more subtle question, which has however received a fair deal of attention: is there a trend in the intensity of tropical storms. A review of relevant research is not our aim, the paper of Kossin et al. (2013) provides background and references. There are two novel aspects to our approach: 1) focus on the annual curves, 2) separate analysis for each intensity level. Based on sixty years of data, our tests detect a trend in the upper wind speeds of Atlantic hurricanes. Exploratory analysis suggests a similar conclusion for Pacific typhoons, but it cannot be supported by low P≠values with the amount of available data. These conclusions are similar to the findings of Kossin et al. (2013) who use different, custom≠prepared, data sets. Their P≠value for the existence of a trend in North Atlantic is less that 10-3, but for the North≠West pacific it is 0.03 (for South Pacific it is 0.09, 0.06 for the South Indian Ocean). Their analysis is concerned with the trend in the scalar data, not a trend in the annual pattern. They find all trends to be positive. In a sense, such trend coefficients can be viewed as averages of the annual curves like those displayed in Figures 3 and 4. The hurricane curves indeed have more positive mass, whereas for the typhoon curves the negative mass is larger (the typhoon curves are not statistically different from zero, according to our tests). The slope functions of the hurricanes indicate increasing intensity in summer and late fall, and decreasing intensity in early fall. For typhoons, these curves indicate decreasing intensity in November.
The conclusions of this paper which are supported by significance tests and do not contradict existing research are as follows:
1. The annual pattern of wind speeds of both hurricanes and typhoons has been changing at all wind speed levels over the last 60 years.
2. There is a significant trend in the shape of this pattern for upper wind speed levels of hurricanes.

A Construction of annual expectile curves

In this section we provide some background needed to understand how the expectile curves studied in Section 3 are constructed. The underlying concept of expectiles was first discussed by Newey and Powell (1987) and further analyzed in several directions, e.g. Efron (1991) or Rossi and Harwey (2009) focused on time-varying expectiles. Most relevant to our setting is the paper by Schnabel and Eilers (2009), which extended the work of Eilers and Marx (1996). It combined the LAWS (least average weighted squares) algorithm with P-splines in order to estimate expectile curves. Recent applications include Guo and H®ardle (2012), Sobotka et al. (2013) and Guo et al. (2015) or more applicable one in finance by Taylor (2008), where Value at risk (VaR) and Expected shortfall (ES) were estimated using expectiles.
Suppose Y is a square integrable random variable with density f . Fix   (0, 1). The  -th expectile e = e is the number which minimizes

E (e) = (1 -  )E-(e) +  E+(e),

where

E-(e) = E+(e) =

e
(u - e)2f (u)du = E (X - e)2 I {X  e} ;
- 
(u - e)2f (u)du = E (X - e)2 I {X > e} .
e

Let F (y) be a cumulative distribution function of Y and G(y) =

y -

uf (u)du

its

first

partial moment. For every   (0, 1), the expectile e = e can be obtained as  -quantile

of the distribution function T (x), where

G(x) - xF (x)

T (x) =

.

2 {G(x) - F (x)} +

x-

 -

udF

(u)

If  = 1/2, then 2E (e) = E [(X - e)2], so e = EX. Expectiles have a similar interpretation as quantiles, but have some desirable properties outlined in the references cited
above. Consider now a scatter plot of points (ti, xi), 1  i  I. In our applications, the ti
correspond to times within a year at which wind speed is measured and xi to the wind speed. Since the form of the dependence of the xi on the ti is unknown, a B-spline expansion is used. We thus assume that

J
xi  ga(ti) = ajBj(ti),
j=1

and find coefficients a = (a1, a2, . . . , aJ ) which minimize

S (a) = (1 -  )S-(a) +  S+(a),

13

where

S-(a) =

{xi - ga(ti)}2 , S+(a) =

{xi - ga(ti)}2 .

xiga(ti)

xi>ga(ti)

If  is close to 1, then S+(a) must be made small. This means that the curve ga will be above most of the points (ti, xi).
Denote a matrix of B-splines differences as D. In order to control the smoothness of
curves we can add penalization and minimize

S (a) + a D Da,

with  as shrinkage parameter chosen by a desired criterion. In our calculations, we chose  according to AIC criterion. The whole algorithm is
implemented in the R package expectreg, see Sobotka et al. (2014) for further details. In some applications, particularly to small and volatile datasets, one can observe cross-
ing curves, even if this is not possible in theory. For that reason expectile curves can be modeled as bivariate functions of the form

KL

µ(x,  ) =

ak Bk(x)C (p).

k=1 =1

The coefficients ak are estimated by minimizing

nJ

S(a) =

wi(j) {xi - µ(ti, j)}2

i=1 j=1

where

wi(j) =

1 -  if xi  µ(ti, j)  if xi > µ(ti, j).

Expectile and quantile sheets are explained in more detail by Schnabel (2011) or Schnabel and Eilers (2013).

B Trend tests: finite sample performance

A simulation study validating the change point test of Section 2.1 is reported in Berkes et al. (2009). In this section, we examine the finite sample performance of the trend tests introduced in Section 2.2.
Data generating processes We consider two models for the error functions n(t). The first is a generic Gaussian model in which we take the n(t) to be Brownian bridges Bn(t). We represent Brownian bridge as a Fourier series with stochastic coefficients (the Karhunen≠Lo¥eve expansion, e.g. Bosq (2000)):

  sin(jt)  J

sin(jt)

Bn(t) = 2 Znj j  2 Znj j ,

j=1 j=1

14

where {Zj, j  1} are independent standard normal random variables. We set J = 100 so the trajectories of the Bn have similar smoothness as the typhoon and hurricane expectile curves.
The second model for the n is based more directly on the tropical storm data. We proceed as follows. We consider  = 0.1, 0.5, 0.9. For each level  , we compute the sample
mean function and the sample functional principal components v^j(t;  ) of the expectile curves Xn(t,  ). Next we compute the scores jn( ) according to (2.1). Denote by j( ) the standard deviation of the jn( ), 1  n  N, (N = 65). The n are generated as independent realizations of the random function

q
(t;  ) = j( )Zjv^j(t;  ),
j=1

Zj  iid N(0, 1),

with q determined from the original expectile curves according to the 85% rule. We thus have four models for the error curves which we refer to as BB, E1, E5, E9. The errors E1, E5, E9 are different depending on whether hurricane or typhoon data are used. The empirical rejection rates are however very similar in both cases. We display the results for the errors based on the hurricane data.
We generate artificial data according to the specification

Xn(t) = b(t)n + n(t).

To find empirical size, we set (t) = 0(t) = 0. To find empirical power, power, we use

the slope functions

1(t)

=

cos -

t3 2

100

;

sin (t20)

2(t) =

, 100

which are graphed in Figure 6. The constant b is used to adjust the magnitude of the

departure from the null hypothesis. For E1, E5 and E9 error curves we set b = 20, for BB

errors we use b = 1. The different values are used to ensure similar signal to noise ration

for both types of errors.

We consider sample sizes N = 30, 60, 120 Empirical rejection rates are shown in Tables

5 and 6. The Monte Carlo test, generally has slightly better size and power, but the

pivotal chi≠square test performs well too. It tends to overreject under H0 (for N = 60 and N = 120), which may explain the smaller P≠values in Table 4 as compared to Table 3.

where {Wj(x), 0  x  1} are independent standard Wiener processes on [0, 1]. The j
and the vj are, respectively, the eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions of the covariance func-
tion c(t, s) = E[n(t)n(s)]. In (C.3), and whenever weak convergence of two parameter processes is concerned, d denotes the convergence in the Skorokhod space D([0, 1], L2).

Thus (2.7) is proven.

Proof of part (ii): The proof follows from several lemmas. It is assumed throughout that HA holds, i.e |||| > 0. The argument relies on Lemma C.1 whose proof follows from the relevant definitions, and so is omitted.

Lemma C.1 Suppose {Xn} and {qn} are sequences of random variables. Suppose further

that {Xn} diverges to infinity in probability and {qn} is bounded in probability , i.e. for

each M, limn P(Xn > M ) = 1 and for each  > 0, there is M such that P(qn > M ) < ,

if n > n0. Then

Relation (2.8) now follows from Lemmas C.2 and C.3.

Lemma C.2 The statistic N defined by (2.7) satisfies N P . Proof: Decompose ^(t) as

^(t) = (t) + GN (t),

where

1 GN (t) = 2 AN

N

Observe that GN (t) is equal to the estimator ^(t) under H0. Therefore, by (C.5),

Consequently, as N

More precisely,

(t) + N -3/2U (t) 2 dt P 1 2(t)dt. 12

Lemma C.3 The sequence {N } defined by (2.9) is bounded in probability, i.e. Op(1).
Proof: Since the ^j are fixed in the generation of the replications in the Monte Carlo test, the variables Zj are independent of the ^j. Therefore, since EZj2 = 1,
N
EN = E^j.
j=1
The definition of the ^j as the eigenvalues of the covariance operator with c^(∑, ∑) defined by (2.4) and (2.6) implies that

N

This is the decomposition of functional sample variance, see Horva¥th and Kokoszka (2012), p. 40. Therefore, if we can show that

lim sup

then we can conclude that lim supN EN < , which in turn implies that the sequence {N } bounded in probability.
The decomposition

(C.10)

^n(t) = n(t) + (t) - ^(t) + n (t) - ^(t) ,

implies that for some constant C,

(C.11)

By Lemmas 2.2. and 2.3 of Horv¥ath and Kokoszka (2012), relations (C.13) will follow
from ||c^ - c||S P 0, where the subscript S denotes the Hilbert≠Schmidt norm. Proposition C.1 states that, in fact, E ||c^ - c||S2 = O(N -1). It thus extends a well≠known result, e.g. Theorem 2.5. of Horva¥th and Kokoszka (2012), which states that

The covariance function c^ is defined in terms of the residuals ^n, cf. (2.4), (2.6). Estimation of the intercept and slope functions introduces many additional terms which are, however, all asymptotically negligible.

Proposition C.1 Suppose model (2.2) holds and E ||||4 < . Then the sample covariance function c^, defined by (2.4) and (2.6), satisfies E ||c^ - c||S2 = O(N -1).
