ABSTRACT
A new test for constant correlation is proposed. Based on the bivariate Student-t distribution, this test is derived as Lagrange multiplier (LM) test. Whereas most of the traditional tests (e.g. Jennrich, 1970, Tang, 1995 and Goetzmann, Li & Rouwenhorst, 2005) specify the unknown correlations as piecewise constant, our model-setup for the correlation coefficient is based on trigonometric functions. Applying this test to assets from different financial markets (stocks, exchange rates, metals) there is empirical evidence that many of the correlations vary over time.
1. INTRODUCTION
Realistic models for the dependence structure of financial returns is one of the current issues in financial statistics. Even though there are more powerful measures of dependence (e.g. Drouet-Mari & Kotz, 2001), the focus of this work is solely on correlations as underlying dependence concept. This means that linear dependence is entirely appropriate which in turn is justified if the joint distribution of the data is multivariate normal, or more generally,

multivariate elliptical. Indeed, empirical investigations give reason to assume that the joint distributions of many asset returns are frequently found to being multivariate elliptical (see, e.g. Zhou, 1993). Agreeing on correlation as adequate dependence measure, it might next be of particular interest whether correlations are constant over time. Stability of correlation is a crucial point: Unstable correlations make it difficult to price and hedge derivatives whose payoffs depends on more than one asset. Similarly, portfolio managers rely on stable correlations in order to reduce or even eliminate their portfolio risk. This motivated numerous empirical studies trying to shed light on the constancy of correlations of financial return data. Kaplanis (1988), for instance, investigates stock indices of 10 countries from 1967 to 1982 and arrives at the conclusion that correlation structure is stable over time. Considering monthly returns from 1973 to 1989, Meric & Meric (1989) found evidence that that international stock market co-movements are stable in the SeptemberMay period, but relatively unstable in the May-September period. Similarly, Koch & Koch (1991) analyzed the stock indices of 8 countries and concluded that the market interdependence within the same geographical region is growing over time. Similarly, Erb, Harvey & Viskanta (1994) found evidence of unstable correlations on the basis of monthly stock indices of G7-countries from 1970 to 1993. Increasing correlations in bear markets but not in bull markets is postulated by Longin & Solnik (1995) for excess returns of stock indices of 7 countries from 1960 to 1990. In contrast, exploring daily stock index returns from 1999 to 2002, Ragea (2002) states that correlation remains stable during volatile periods. Recently, Goetzmann, Li & Rouwenhorst (2005) claim that the correlation structure varies significantly, using worldwide monthly return series from 1872 to 2000. All of these studies rely on a few statistical tests which assume that correlations of financial returns are piecewise constant over time. Above that, the points of time where regimes (i.e. periods with constant correlation) change are commonly unknown. In contrast, we make use of a test which allows correlations to vary over time according to certain trigonometric functions. Hence, no assumptions on "change points" are necessary and "smooth transitions" between two consecutive regimes are admitted. This allows to detect time-varying dependencies, where "conventional" tests might fail. The outline of this work is as follows: Section 2 briefly reviews standard tests for constant correlation. A test based on trigonometric functions is introduced in section 3. Section 4 is dedicated to the description of the data set and to the discussion of the empirical results. Finally, section 5 concludes.

2. TESTS FOR CONSTANT CORRELATION: A SHORT REVIEW

Though all of the following tests for constant correlation are designed for the multivariate

case, we restrict discussion to the bivariate case, henceforth. In general, these tests are rooted

on Bartlett's (1937) test on equal variances, say 12 and 22, of two iid-normally distributed

random samples with possibly different lengths N1 and N2. Denoting the sample variance of

group j by Sj2 and defining a pooled sample variance S2 =

2 j=1

Nj -1 N1+N2-2

,

Bartlett's

statistic is given by

Box (1949) extended Bartlett's proposal to a test for homogeneity of covariance matrices, say 1 and 2, of two subperiods. Equation (1) generalizes to

TBox

where Sj denotes the sample covariance matrix of subperiod j. Assuming independent and bivariate normally distributed random samples, Box (1949) proposes both a 2- and an F -approximation to TBox. Finally, Kullback (1967) and Tang (1995) deal with the application of Box's test to correlation matrices rather than covariance matrices (by substituting the covariance matrices by the corresponding correlation matrices in the last formula). In particular, Kullback (1967) asserts that if all populations have the same non-singular correlation matrix, then the distribution of the test statistics is asymptotically chi-squared with certain degrees of freedom. However, Jennrich (1970, p. 905) presented a counterexample where Kullback's assertion fails. Jennrich (1970) himself suggested a test for equality of correlation matrices. Under the assumption of independent samples from two k-variate normal populations, the vector d ­ which contains all k = k(k - 1)/2 dissimilar element-by-element differences of the two sample correlation matrices in lexographic order ­ is asymptotically normal with mean zero and non-singular covariance matrix . Therefore,

where  is a consistent estimator of . Jennrich's main contribution was to derive a representation for the inverse of  which also applies to high dimensions in a simple way. In order to get rid off the normality assumption, Goetzmann, Li & Rouwenhorst (2005) utilize the asymptotic distribution of the correlation matrix from Browne & Shapiro (1986) and Neudecker & Wesselman (1990). Their proposal only requires that the observation vectors

with a certain matrix estimator  and suitable degrees of freedom k+ (For more details see Goetzmann, Li & Rouwenhorst, 2005). Note that all of these tests presume that correlation is piecewise constant over time. In contrast, the TCt-test which is introduced next section allows correlation to vary over time according to certain trigonometric functions. In particular, our model includes smooth transitions between different regimes rather than abrupt changes.

3. DERIVATION OF THE CC-TRIGt TEST

Undoubtedly, the multivariate Student-t distribution can be considered as one of the most popular models for financial returns (see, e.g., Aas & Haff, 2006). A random variable X with mean vector µ and dispersion matrix  is said to follow a d-variate Student-t distribution with  degrees of freedom if its density has the form

f (x; µ, , )

=

(

(

-(+d)/2
.

(2)

The corresponding covariance matrix is   Cov(X) =

> 2.

For a better

interpretation, we re-scale the Student-t density such that

f (x; µ, , ) =

For a given random sample Xt, t = 1, . . . , T from a bivariate Student-t distribution let us further assume that the correlation coefficient t at time t evolves according to the trigonometric equation

t  0 + 1 sin(2f t/T ) + 2 cos(2f t/T ), t = 1, . . . , T, f  R,

(5)

where 0, 1 and 2 have to be chosen such that   [-1, 1] and f denotes an appropriate though in general unknown frequency. Possible curves of t are plotted in figure 1, below.
Figure 1: 0 = 0, 1 = 0.2, 2 = 0.3 and 0 = 0, 1 = -0.1, 2 = 0.6. In order to demonstrate that correlation curves with these patterns may inherent to reallife data sets, consider the plot of the rolling correlations between two assets (where the correlation coefficient is successively calculated on the basis of the last 150 days over the whole time-period) as a proxy to the time-varying correlation. For the exchange rate pairs Canadian Dollar/US-Dollar versus Japanese Yen/US-Dollar and Japanese Yen/US-Dollar versus Britisch pound/US-Dollar we obtain (for a period of about 10 years) the running correlation curves in figure 2, below. Additionally, the solid lines represent fitted correlation curves of the form
t  0 + 1 sin(2f t/T ) + 2 cos(2f t/T ), where the unknown parameters have been estimated by means of non-linear least-square methods. More details about that point are provided in the empirical section of this paper.
Figure 2: Left panel: 0 = 0.14, 1 = 0.047, 2 = 0.023 and f = 1.4, right panel: 0 = 0.54, 1 = -0.04, 2 = -0.24 and f = 1.25.

Assuming that the iid-sample Xt, t = 1, . . . , T stems from a bivariate Student-t distribution and that the correlation coefficient at time t evolves according to the extended model in

equation (5), we next derive a test whether H0 : 1 = 2 = 0, i.e. whether correlations are constant over time. On the basis of the log-likelihood function,

one might consider a likelihood ratio (LR) test, where LR = -2[ () - (0)] has to be calculated. Note that  and 0, respectively, denote the maximum likelihood (ML) estimators of  for the unrestricted and the restricted model, respectively. Within this work we make use of the Lagrange multiplier (LM) test (A comprehensive treatment of LM tests can be found, for instance, in Godfrey, 1988) which only requires estimates under the constant-correlation (i.e. under the restricted) model. It is essentially based on the score vector

In the context of unrestricted estimates the score function is zero by definition. Now if the

restricted estimates are close to the unrestricted estimates, the evaluated score should be

close to zero. With s = s(0) and

and under the temporary assumption that the frequency f is known, the LM-type test sta-
-1
tistics reads LM(f )  s S S s. Being the sum of cross products of the first derivatives

of t, S S estimates Fisher's information matrix V = E(2 / ).

Unfortunately, the frequency f is unknown in practice and has to be estimated from the data set. Following a proposal of Beckers, Ender & Hurn (2004) ­ who consider functions as in equation (5) in order to detect structural breaks in regression models within a likelihood ratio framework ­ one might consider a finite set  of K different frequencies and consider the test statistics

which arise from the maximum, the average and the exponentially weighted average of the LM(f )-statistics. Whereas LM(f ) is asymptotically chi-squared with 2 degrees of freedom under certain regularity conditions and for known f , LMm, LMs and LMa are no longer. For this reason, critical values are obtained employing parametric bootstrap techniques as follows:

1. For i = 1, . . . , J repeat the following two steps: 2. Generate iid-samples X(1i), . . . , XT(i) from a bivariate Student-t with  = 0. 3. For a given set , calculate LMm(i), LM(si) and LM(ai). 4. The proportion of J bootstrapped test statistics which exceed the test statistics from
the observed data is then an estimate of the p-values of the test(s).

4. EMPIRICAL RESULTS

To cover a broad range of financial assets, we applied the CC-Trigt-test to foreign exchange rate data from leading currencies (Yen/USD, Swiss Franc/USD, Britisch pound/USD, Canadian Dollar/USD) as well as to exchange rates from Asian emerging markets (Yen/EUR, Singapore Dollar/EUR, Won/EUR, Taiwan Dollar/EUR, Baht/EUR). Above that, emphasis was put on stock returns from the telecommunication market (Telecom Austria, France Telekom, Deutsche Telekom, Telefonica, T.I.M) and from the automobile sector (BMW, VW, DaimlerChrysler, Porsche, Renault, Peugeot). Finally, empirical investigations were performed for assets from the metal market (lead, tin, nickel, zinc). A first impression on the aforementioned data is provided by table 1, below, which summarizes estimated means, estimated variances, empirical skewness and kurtosis coefficients (measured by the third and fourth standardized moments) and the results of the Ljung-Box test on serial correlation and Engle's LM test (for p = 10 lags). Obviously, most of the data sets are highly leptokurtic (in particular the Asian exchange rates) and skew to some extend. Moreover, the results of the Ljung-Box test and of Engle's LM test indicate the presence of minor serial

correlation and of significant (G)ARCH effects. In order to eliminate the possible influence of time-dependencies on the results of our test, we additionally fitted univariate ARMAGARCH models to each of the series and considered standardized residuals (from now on briefly "GARCH residuals") in addition to the original returns (from now on briefly "plain returns").

Table 1: Data statistics.

Figure 3 displays the time series for each of the five markets. To guarantee a better graphical comparison between the series of each market we re-scaled all series to 100 at the starting point of the data collection. This highlights, for instance, the tremendous growth of Porsche compared to other companies from the car industry.
Figure 3: Re-scaled time series for all markets. One of the crucial points of our test is to determine the set  which contains the frequencies underlying our test. On the one hand, too many frequencies may result in unnecessary computational burden, wrong or too less frequencies may produce misleading results. Against this background we suggest the following procedure to identify the relevant frequencies:

In a first step, the rolling correlations rct, t - , . . . , T between two asset returns (based on the last  observations) are calculated. In a second step, for given frequencies 0 = f1, f2, . . ., fN = U , functions of the form
t  0 + 1 sin(2f t/T ) + 2 cos(2f t/T ) are fitted to the rolling correlations such that the squared differences
K(0, 1, 2) = (rct - t)2
t
are minimal. Let M (f ) denote the corresponding minimum which belongs to frequency f . Plotting f against M (f ) for all frequencies under consideration can be used as a graphical instrument to determine the interval. Exemplarily, plots for different stock returns are subject to figure 4, below. The minimal frequencies are given by f  1.25 and f  2.00, respectively.
Figure 4: Choosing the interval for f (U = 6,  = 150, N = 60).

The empirical results of our new test are documented in table 2 to 6. Concerning the FX rates in table 2, there seems to be strong evidence for time-varying correlation for both plain returns and GARCH residuals. Critical values are printed in brackets, below.

The situation for the Asian exchange rate returns is quite different. While the null hypothesis is rejected for the plain returns, there is less evidence for correlations to vary over time if the time-serial dependencies are removed. This does not apply to the exchange rates of Korea and Taiwan.

Surprisingly, the correlations between different stocks from the telecommunication market appear rather stable in the time period which we considered, except for T A1/T EF , F T E/T EF and T EF/T QI. In particular, the stock returns of Deutsche Telekom and that of its competitors show no time-varying pattern.

Table 6: Stock returns: Telecommunication.

We conclude this section providing the results for the (competitive) tests of section 2. Due to its design for heavy-tailed data, only the test of Goetzmann, Li & Rouwenhorst (2005) for GARCH residuals was taken into account. Table 7 summarizes the empirical results. In many cases, results are identically between the GLR test and the CC-Trigt test. However, in some cases (e.g. tin and zinc or nickel and zinc), empirical evidence for time-varying correlation is found using the CC-Trigt test while the GLR test fails. This might be due to the construction of the GLR test, where only piecewise constant correlation is allowed.

5. SUMMARY

This paper proposes a new test for constant correlation. Based on the bivariate Student-t distribution and correlation coefficients which are allowed to change according to certain trigonometric functions, three Lagrange multiplier-type test statistics are proposed. We approximate the critical values of these statistics by means of bootstrapping. Secondly, the test is applied to asset returns, resp. GARCH residuals from different markets. The results show that stock returns from the automobile industry exhibit time-varying correlations, whereas the correlations observed on the telecommunication market tend to be constant over time. This also applies to Asian exchange rate returns and some of the assets from the commodity market.
