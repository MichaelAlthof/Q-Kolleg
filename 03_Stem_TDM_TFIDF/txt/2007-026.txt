Abstract: We give an explicit PDE characterization for the solution of the problem of maximizing the utility of both terminal wealth and intertemporal consumption under model uncertainty. The underlying market model consists of a risky asset, whose volatility and long-term trend are driven by an external stochastic factor process. The robust utility functional is defined in terms of a HARA utility function with risk aversion parameter 0 <  < 1 and a dynamically consistent coherent risk measure, which allows for model uncertainty in the distributions of both the asset price dynamics and the factor process. Our method combines recent results by Wittmu¨ss (2007) on the duality theory of robust optimization of consumption with a stochastic control approach to the dual problem of determining a `worst-case martingale measure'.

1 Introduction

Recently, there has been considerable interest in studying optimization problems in which the target functional is defined in terms of a coherent or convex risk measure. These optimization problems can be called robust since optimization involves an entire class Q of possible probabilistic models and thus takes into account model risk; see, e.g., [24] and the references therein. This link between model uncertainty and risk measures is particularly transparent in the theory of investors preferences under model uncertainty as developed by Gilboa and Schmeidler [12]. By introducing an axiom called `uncertainty aversion' within an extended von Neumann-Morgenstern framework, Gilboa and Schmeidler [12] derive the following representation for the corresponding utility functional:

where Q is a set of probability measures, and U is a utility function. A natural question is

now to study some of classical problems of mathematical finance and economics within this

setup. Optimal investment problems for such robust utility functionals were considered,

among others, by Talay and Zheng [27], Korn and Wilmott [19], Quenez [22], Schied [23],

Korn and Menkens [17], Gundel [13], Schied and Wu [26], Fo¨llmer and Gundel [8], Korn

and Steffensen [18], and Hern´andez-Hern´andez and Schied [14, 15].

The present paper is a continuation of [14], where the problem of maximizing the

robust utility of the terminal wealth was studied in a stochastic factor model and for

HARA utility functions

x U (x) = ,


x > 0,

with risk aversion parameter  < 0. Here, we will discuss the case  > 0, which is more

difficult than the case  < 0 and requires completely different methods. We will moreover

allow for intertemporal consumption strategies, which is important for several fascinating

applications in macro-economic theory; see, e.g., Barillas et al. [1] and the references

therein. Also the setup of our market model is more general than in [14] and now includes

local volatility models.

Our method relies first on an application of the duality results for the robust optimiza-

tion of consumption obtained by Wittmu¨ss [28] (earlier results on the same problem were

obtained by Burgert and Ru¨schendorf [2], but they are not applicable to our situation,

due to more restrictive assumptions). The idea of using convex duality so as to transform

the original minimax problem into a minimization problem was first used by Quenez [22].

After using [28] to set up the dual problem as a two-parameter minimization problem, we

then use stochastic control techniques to derive a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation for

the value function v. Our main result states that v is in fact a classical solution of this

quasi-linear PDE. In particular, we avoid the use of (non-smooth) viscosity solutions and

thus obtain explicit formulas for the optimal strategy in terms of v and its derivatives.

The increased difficulty of the problem for  > 0 in comparison to the case  < 0

is related to the fact that a `worst-case martingale measure' may not exist and that

the infimum may only be attained within a larger class of sub-probability measures.

This phenomenon is well-known also in standard utility maximization; see Kramkov and

Schachermayer [20, Section 5]. On the analytical side, it corresponds to the possible

unboundedness of the gradient of the value function v in the case  > 0; see Lemma 3.5

and its proof. Establishing the boundedness of this gradient in the case  < 0 was the

key step in [14].

The paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we introduce our model and

state our main result. Its proof is given in Section 3.

2 Statement of main results

We consider a financial market model with a locally riskless money market account

dSt0 = St0r(Yt) dt

(1)

3

with locally risk-free rate r  0 and a risky asset defined under a reference measure P

through the SDE

dSt = Stb(Yt) dt + St(Yt) dWt1.

(2)

Here W 1 is a standard P-Brownian motion and Y denotes an external economic factor process modeled by the SDE

dYt = g(Yt) dt + (Yt) dWt1 + (Yt) dWt2

(3)

for a standard P-Brownian motion W 2, which is independent of W 1 under P. We suppose that the economic factor can be observed but cannot be traded directly so that the market
model is typically incomplete. Models of this type have been widely used in finance and economics, the case of a mean-reverting factor process with the choice g(y) := -(µ - y)
being particularly popular; see, e.g., Fleming and Hern´andez-Herna´ndez [4], Fouque et al. [10], and the references therein. We assume that g belongs to C2(R), with derivative g  Cb1(R), and r, b, , , and  belong to Cb2(R), where Cbk(R) denotes the class of bounded functions with bounded derivatives up to order k. We will also assume that

(y)

and

a(y)

:=

1 (2(y) 2

+

 2 (y))



12

for

some

constants

0, 1

>

0.

(4)

The market price of risk with respect to the reference measure P is defined via the function

b(y) - r(y)

(y) :=

.

(y)

The assumption of time-independent coefficients is for convenience in the exposition only and can be relaxed by standard arguments. Similarly, it is easy to extend our results to a d-dimensional stock market model replacing the one-dimensional SDE (2).

(y)

(y),

g(y)

b(y) -

(y

),

and

Y0

it

follows that Y coincides with log S. Hence, S solves the SDE of a local volatility model:

dSt = Stb(St) dt + St(St) dWt1,

(5)

where b(x) = b(log x) and (x) = (log x). Thus, our analysis includes the study of the robust optimal investment problem for local volatility models given by (5), and it will be easy to derive the corresponding equation as a special case of our main result, Theorem 2.2.

In most economic situations, investors typically face model uncertainty in the sense that the dynamics of the relevant quantities are not precisely known. One common approach to coping with model uncertainty is to admit an entire class Q of possible prior models. Here, we will consider the class

where E(M )t = exp(Mt - M t/2) denotes the Doleans-Dade exponential of a continuous local martingale M and C denotes the set of all progressively measurable processes  =

(1, 2) such that t belongs dt  dP-a.e. to some fixed compact convex set   R2. Note

that due to Novikov's theorem we have a one-to-one correspondence between measures

Q  Q and processes   C (up to dt  dP-nullsets).

Let A denote the set of all pairs (c, ) of progressively measurable process  and c

Then Xx,c, describes the evolution of the wealth process of an investor with initial en-
dowment X0x,c, = x > 0 who is consuming at the rate cs and investing the fraction s of the current wealth Xsx,c, into the risky asset at time s  [0, T ]. By A(x) we denote the subclass of all (c, )  A that are admissible in the sense that Xtx,c,  0 P-a.s. for all t.

Moreover, by defining a measure Q  Q via

we obtain a saddlepoint ((c, ), Q) for the maximin problem (7).

Remark 2.3 For  = 0 the HJB equation (9) can be simplified by passing to the logtransorm w := log v; see [14].

3 Proof of the main result

We will first set up the dual problem to (7) following Wittmu¨ss [28]. To check for the applicability of the results in [28], note first that our choice (8) obviously satisfies [28, Assumption 2.2]. Moreover, the convex risk measure

(Y ) := sup EQ[ -Y ],
QQ

Y  L(P),

is continuous from below on L(P). This follows by combining [14, Lemma 3.1], [26,

Lemma 3.2], and [9, Corollary 4.35]. Hence, [28, Assumption 2.1] is also satisfied.

Let us denote by M the set of all progressively measurable processes  such that

T 0

t2

P-a.s.,

and

define

Zt := E - (Ys) dWs1 - s dWs2 .
t

Moreover, we introduce the conjugate function U (z) = supx0(U (x) - zx) and the prob-

ability measure

where nT denotes the normalizing constant. It then follows from [28, Remark 2.7] and [16, Proposition 4.1] that, up to the normalizing constant n-T 1, the dual value function of
the robust utility maximization problem is given by

u(z) := inf inf E
C M

DtU (zZt/(DtSt0)) µT (dt) ,

where Dt = E s dWs .
0t
Due to [28, Theorem 2.5], the primal value function u can then be obtained as

(12)

u(x) = nT min(u(z) + zx).
z>0

(13)

Moreover, the same result yields that if z > 0 minimizes (13) and there are control processes (, ) minimizing (12) for z = z, then, for I(y) := -U (y), the choice

(14)

defines an optimal strategy (c, )  A(x). Here the factors e-t/nT and 1/nT come from the fact that in (6) we have introduced c as the consumption density with respect to the Lebesgue measure rather than with respect to µT as is required by [28]; XTx,c, plays the rol of a lump consumption at the terminal time T . In our specific setting (8), we have U (z) = z-/ with  = /1 - . Thus, we can simplify the duality formula (13) as
follows. First, the expectation in (12) equals

Optimizing over z > 0 then yields that

By taking the strategy (c, )  (x/(T + 1), 0) in the definition (11) of u we obtain u(x)  nT (x/(T + 1))/ for all x > 0. Combining this fact with (16) yields

Our next aim is to further simplify ,. To this end, note that (Dt)1+(Zt )-(St0)

+ r(y).

The Doleans-Dade exponential in (18) will be denoted by t ,. If

T 0

t2 dt

is

bounded,

then E[ T, ] = 1. In general, however, we may have E[ T, ] < 1 and this fact will create

some technical difficulties in the sequel.

Our aim is to minimize , over   C and   M0. To this end, for t  0 and   0, we introduce the measures

µt(ds)

:=

e(t-s)I (s)
[0,t]

t(ds)

and, for Y0 = y, the function

J (t, y, , ) := E (Ds)1+(Zs)-(Ss0) µt(ds)

s

= E t, exp

q(Yr, r, r) dr µt(ds)

0

so that by taking  := e-T we get J(T, Y0, , ) = nT ,. To make the dependence of Y on its initial value explicit, we will sometimes also write Y y for the solution of the SDE

(3) with initial value Y0 = y. We will now use dynamic programming methods to solve the stochastic control prob-

lem with value function defined by

V (t, y) := inf inf J(t, y, , ).
M C

By taking T := t and  := et, the inequality (17) yields

1 V (t, y)  nt t + 1 > 0

for all t, y.

(19)

For simplicity, we denote

a(y) := 1 (2(y) + 2(y)) and g(y) := g(y) + (y)(y). 2

The proof of this theorem will be prepared by several auxiliary lemmas. The first one deals with the possibility E[ T, ] < 1. This happens when Z is only a local martingale and not a true martingale. To deal with this situation, we will follow F¨ollmer [6, 7] and introduce the enlarged sample space ¯ := ×]0, ] endowed with the filtration

F¯t :=  A×]s, ] | A  Fs, s  t .

A finite (Ft)-stopping time  is lifted up to an (F¯t)-stopping time ¯ by setting ¯(, s) :=



()I
]

(),]

(s).

Now

let





M

be

given.

Although

we

may

have

E[ ZT

]

<

1

it

is

possible

to associate Z with a probability measure P¯ on (¯ , F¯), where F¯ = ( t F¯t) as usual.

This measure is called the Fo¨llmer measure associated with the positive supermartingale

Z, and it is characterized by

P¯[ A×]t, ] ] = E[ ZtT IA ],

0  t, A  Ft;

see [6, 7]. This identity carries over to the case in which the deterministic time t is replaced by a stopping time  .

Lemma 3.2 Suppose   C and   M are given, and (n) is a localizing sequence for the local P-martingale Z. Then

E (Dtn )1+ (Ztn )- (St0n )

E (Dt)1+(Zt )-(St0) .

In particular, the integrands converge in L1(P) if E[ (Dt)1+(Zt)-(St0) ] < .

Proof: Since (St0n) increases to the bounded random variable (St0), we may assume r  0 without loss of generality. Let Q be the probability measure in Q associated with , and let us write D := D and Z := Z.
First, we clearly have

lim inf E
n

(Dtn )1+ (Ztn )-

 E (Dt)1+(Zt)-

(21)

due to Fatou's lemma. Next, let P¯ be the F¨ollmer measure associated with the positive supermartingale Z
and let Q¯ := Q   the extension of Q to (¯ , F¯). Since Z is strictly positive, we obtain
that for t  T and A  Ft

Q¯[ A×]t, ] ] = E[ DtIA ] = E

Hence, Q P¯ and the density process is given by

Replacing t by a stopping time   T on the right, we thus obtain the density of Q¯ with respect to P¯ on F¯¯, due to the optional stopping theorem. Hence, for two stopping times

where the inequality follows from Jensen's inequality for conditional expectations, and the last identity follows by reversing our previous steps. In particular, E[ (Dtn)1+(Ztn)- ] is increasing in n and bounded above by E[ (Dt)1+(Zt)- ]. By combining this fact with
(21), the result follows.

The following lemma is a version of a standard verification result. Later on, it will first be applied with the choice I := [-M, M ], which corresponds to restricting the control
space for  in (20). The fact that I is compact will later on allow us to apply existence results for classical solutions vI of the corresponding HJB equation.
We will say that a function v : [0, T ] × R  R is of polynomial growth if there exist constants c and p  0 such that |vI(t, y)|  c(1 + |y|p) for all y  R and 0  t  T .

admits a classical solution vI of polynomial growth satisfying the initial condition

vI(0, y) = 1.

(23)

In case I is non-compact, we assume in addition that vI is bounded and strictly positive. Then we have vI(t, y) = V I(t, y), where

V I(t, y) := inf inf J(t, y, , )
C MI

for MI denoting the set of all I-valued   M0. In particular, we have

vI (t, y)  nt

1 t+1



for t  T and y  R.

(24)

10

Proof: Let us write v = vI throughout the proof. Let   C and   MI be controls such that such that J(u, y, , ) <  and define

dMs := (Ys) dWs1 + (Ys) dWs2 - (Ys) (1 + )1s + (Ys) ds - (Ys) (1 + )2s + s ds. Then the SDE for Y can be rewritten as

dYs = dMs + g(Ys) + (Ys)(1 + )1s + (Ys) (1 + )2s + s ds.

For any   I and    we define a differential operator Ae,e by

Ae,e = -t + ayy + g + (1 + )1 +  (1 + )2 +  y.

Then, by Ito^'s formula and (22),

(25)

Next let

t

Then (n) is a localizing sequence for the local P-martingale Z. Defining a probability measure P n by dP n = u,n dP, it follows from Girsanov's theorem that (Mtn)0tu is a P n-martingale. By taking expectations with respect to P n, we hence get

and an application of Lemma 3.2, together with monotone convergence and our assumption J(u, y, , ) < , implies that the latter expression converges to

u
e(u-t)EQ (Dt)(Zt )-(St0) dt.
0

The first expectation in (26) is equal to

EQ (Dun )(Zun )-(Su0n )v(u - u  n, Yun ) .

(27)

11

We will argue below that the integrands in (27) are uniformly integrable with respect to Q. Due to the initial condition (23) and the continuity of v, we will thus get

v(u, Y0)  EQ (Dt)(Zt)-(St0) µu(dt) = J (u, y, , )

(28)

and in turn v  V I. Let us now show that the integrands in (27) are uniformly integrable. For unbounded I,
this follows from the boundedness of v, Lemma 3.2, and our assumption J(u, y, , ) < . For bounded I, one easily shows that the integrands have uniformly bounded L2(Q)norms. Indeed, we have

EQ (Dtn )2(Ztn )-2(St0n )2v(u - u  n, Yun )2

(Dtn )4 (Ztn )-4 (St0n )4

.

The uniform boundedness of the first term on the right now follows by an application
of Lemma 3.2 for  := 4. The second term can be bounded in the form C(1 + EQ[ |Yun|4p ]), due to the polynomial growth condition of v. It is well known and easy to show that, under the original measure P, the random variable suptT |Yt| has moments of all orders. Since the process  is bounded, the same is true under Q, and the desired
uniform integrability follows. In order to prove the reverse inequality v  V I, let us first consider the case of a
compact interval I. Due to compactness, we then may find Markov controls

(, )  arg min (1 + )1 +  (1 + )2 +  vy + q(·, , )v ,
 I ,

which by a measurable selection argument can be chosen as measurable functions (t, y), (t, y) of t and y. Using the controls s := (u - s, Ys)  MI, s := (u - s, Ys)  C, we get an equality in (25) and hence in (26) and (28). Thus, v(t, y)  J(t, y, , )  V I(t, y).
In particular, (24) follows from (19).
If I is unbounded, we note first that the supremum of the nonlinear term in (22) with respect to all   R is attained in

·

vy , v

(29)

which is always well-defined, due to our hypothesis of strict positivity of v. Hence, the

supremum with respect to   I is also attained, and we can define processes s := (u - s, Ys) and s := (u - s, Ys) as above, for which we get an equality in (25). We clearly have   C and that  is I-valued. In addition, for any (t, y), the function (t, y)

is either of the form (29) with 2 replaced by 2(t, y) or takes its value in the boundary of

I, and so the boundedness of 2, the continuity of vy and v, and the strict positivity of v

imply that

According to [5, Theorem IV.4.3 and Remark IV.4.1], the equation (22)­(23) admits a unique classical solution vI of polynomial growth as soon as I is compact. By the preceding lemma, this solution is equal to the value function V I. Our goal is to show
that the unconstrained value function V can be obtained as an appropriate limit of the functions vI = V I when I  R. To this end, we will prove some a priori estimates, which hold uniformly with respect to I.

Lemma 3.4 Suppose I is a compact real interval containing 0. Then,

0  vtI(t, y)  C1vI(t, y),

where

C1 := inf q(·, x, 0)  + e( + ) e q(·,x,0) .
x

In particular, vI is uniformly bounded on [0, T ] × R:

1  vI (t, y)  eC1T .

Proof: We will use the representation of vI as the value function V I. Let us take  ]0, 1] such that 0  t +   T . Since I is compact, , is a P-martingale for all   C and   MI. Hence, in proving the lower bound we may argue that

V I(t + , y) - V I(t, y)  inf J(t + , y, , ) - J(t, y, , )

and one easily sees that the difference of the two integrals is nonnegative, due to our assumption r  0.
To prove the upper bound, take  > 0, x  , and processes   MI and   C such that V I(t, y) +   J(t, y, , ) and, for s  [t, t + ], s = 0 and s = x. It follows from Lemma 3.2 that

Lemma 3.5 Suppose that I is a compact nonempty real interval containing zero, and vI
is the classical solution of polynomial growth to (22)­(23). Then there exists a constant C2, depending only on , , , , and the coefficients in (1)­(3), such that |vyI|  C2(1 + |y|) and |vyIy|  C2(1 + |y|2).

Proof: Let w := log vI = log V I  0. We have |vyI | = vI |wy| and |vyIy|  vI (|wyy| + wy2). Since vI  eC1T by Lemma 3.4, it is sufficient to obtain analogous estimates on |wy| and
|wyy| from above. The function w satisfies the equation

wt = ete-w + a(wyy + wy2) + (g + )wy

(30)

+ inf inf (1 + )1 +  (1 + )2 +  wy + q(·, , )
I 

with initial condition

w(0, ·)  0.

Moreover, we have

0  wt  C1,

(31)

due to Lemma 3.4. Next, the boundedness of w implies that, for fixed t, the function y  |wy(t, y)| cannot
tend towards its supremum as y   or y  -. Hence, it is enough to estimate the function wy(t, y) in its critical points. In these points, we have

wt = ete-w + awy2 + gwy + I (wy),

(32)

where I denotes the infimum in (30), considered as a function of wy (and implicitly also of y). When taking the infimum over all   R one finds that

0  I(y, p)  - 1 2(y)p2 + (y, p), 2

p  R,

(33)

where

(y, p) := inf


(y)(1 + )1 + (y)2

By using the upper bound in (31) and the lower bound in (33), we obtain

(wy).

Next, due to the compactness of , we have |(y, p)|  c1(1 + |p|) for a constant c1 depending on , ,  ,  , and  . Using the fact that g(y) grows at most linearly in y, we thus get

C1

where 1 is as in (4) and c2 is an appropriate constant depending on c1, g, ,  , and  . Hence,

c3 + c24(1 + |y|)2)  wy(t, y) - c4(1 + |y|) ,

where c3 and c4 depend on C1, c2, , and 1, and from here the estimate on |wy| follows. Also the one on |wyy| is now straightforward.

14

Proof of Theorem 3.1: We first restrict the control space for  to some bounded interval I := [-M, M ]. As mentioned above, this guarantees the existence of a classical solution vI of the constrained HJB equation (22)­(23) such that vI has at most polynomial growth. By Lemma 3.3, this solution is unique and corresponds to the value function V I. Moreover, it is bounded and  1 according to Lemma 3.4. As observed in (29), the supremum with respect to   I in (22) is achieved at



=

·

VyI , VI

(34)

when this expression belongs to the set I. Otherwise it will be achieved in the extremes of this set. By Lemma 3.5,  will be given by (34) as soon as

M  M (y) := max |2| +


 C2 (1 + |y|). 1+

Thus, denoting In := [-M (n), M (n)] and vn := vIn, we conclude that vn locally satisfies the unconstrained HJB equation, i.e.,

vtn = et + avyny + gvyn + vn(vyn/vn),

for |y|  n,

with
(p) := inf inf (1 + )1 +  (1 + )2 +  p + q(·, , ) .
R 
It follows from the definition of the value functions that the functions vn = V In pointwise decrease to a function v satisfying 1  v  eC1T . Since the gradients vyn and time derivatives vtn are locally uniformly bounded by Lemmas 3.5 and 3.4, it follows from the Arzela-Ascoli theorem that convergence holds even locally uniformly in C([0, T ] × R). Moreover, by Lemma 3.5 also vyny is locally uniformly bounded. For each t, another application of the Arzela-Ascoli theorem thus yields the existence of a subsequence (vnk(t, ·)) such that (vynk(t, ·)) converges locally uniformly in C(R) to vy(t, ·), hence v  C0,1([0, T ] × R). Furthermore, the locally uniform bounds on vtn, vyn, and vyny imply that v is locally Lipschitz continuous on [0, T ] × R with |vt|  C1v a.e. on [0, T ] × R and |vy(t, y)|  C2(1 + |y|) for all t  T and y  R. Moreover,

|vy(t, y) - vy(t, y )|  C2(1 + K2)|y - y | for y, y  [-K, K].

Next, let fn(t, y) := et + vn(t, y)In(vyn(t, y)/vn(t, y)), so that the equation for vn can be written as vtn = avyny + gvyn + fn. Since vn belongs to C1,2([0, T ] × R) and fn has
at most linear growth in y, we obtain the stochastic representation

t

vn(t, y) = 1 + E

fn(s, Ysy) ds ,

0

where Y solves (3) with g replaced by g. In fact, Lemma 3.5 even yields |fn(t, y)|  C3(1 + |y|2) uniformly in n, t  T , and y  R for some constant C3. Hence, using the

15

convergence of vn and vyn and passing to the limit with dominated convergence, combined with the fact that supst |Ysy| has moments of all orders, yields

t
v(t, y) = 1 + E f (s, Ysy) ds ,
0

where f (t, y) := et + v(t, y)(vy(t, y)/v(t, y)). If we can show that (t, y)  f (t, y) is continuous, then, since f satisfies a local Lipschitz condition in y uniformly in t  T , Theorem 12 on p. 25 of [11] will imply that v is a bounded C1,2-solution of the linear
parabolic equation vt = avyy + gvy + f and in turn of (20). Moreover, Lemma 3.3 will yield the identification v = V .
To prove the continuity of f , let us fix a flow of (Yty)yR, t0 so that we have

The stochastic exponential on the right is the density process with respect to P of a probability measure P under which Y solves the SDE

dYty = (Yty) dWt1 + (Yty) dWt2 + h(Yty) dt

for two independent P-Brownian motions W i, i = 1, 2, and with h = g +  +  . Note that y  f (s, y) is locally Lipschitz continuous on [-K, K] with a Lipschitz constant that is uniform in t  [0, T ] and growths at most as a constant times K4. Hence, dominated
convergence implies that

The latter expression is Lipschitz continuous in t, locally uniformly in y. Together with the already established local Lipschitz continuity of y  vy(t, y), which holds uniformly in t  [0, T ], we obtain the continuity of (t, y)  vy(t, y), which in turn yields the continuity of f =  + v(vy/v).

Proof of Theorem 2.2: First, one easily checks that by taking the minimum over   R the two equations (9) and (20) become equivalent when taking  := e-T . So let v be
the solution of (20).
To compute the optimal strategy (c, ), recall from (14) and (15) that the optimal consumption process and the optimal wealth process XTx,bcb are given by

Let

P-martingale.

First, it follows from (29) and

our bounds on the solution v that |t|  C(1 + |Yt|) for some constant C. Since by

[21, Theorem 4.7] there exists  > 0 such that sup0tT E exp(|Yt|) < , we obtain

sup0tT E exp(|t|) <  for  = /C. According to [21], p. 220, the martingale property of Zb follows.

Next, by arguing as in the proof of [25, Theorem 2.5] and using the duality relations

as stated in [28, Theorem 2.5], one shows that

Mt :=

Using the Markov property of Y and introducing the controls s(t) := (T - t - s, Ys) and s(t) := (T - t - s, Ys), we obtain

Et = J (T - t, Yt, (t), (t)) = v(T - t, Yt).

completes the proof of Theorem 2.2.
