Abstract
This paper demonstrates effects of economic convergence processes on the foreign exchange behaviour in a monetary modelling approach. Since the exchange rate represents the relative price of two currencies, commonness of stochastic trends between the fundamental determinants of supply and demand of the underlying monies restricts exchange rate movements to transitory fluctuations. In the spirit of optimal currency areas, this has the potential to serve as a criterion for an all-round integration of two economies. Empirically, such a constellation is found between Australia and New Zealand, whereas diverging trends in money and interest rates characterise the relation of Australia towards the US.

1 Introduction
The notion of a "fundamental" value of exchange rates has become standard in economic science, media and politics. However, this large circulation is hardly based on extensive success of the underlying theory in applications to real-world issues; far more, the discussion on long-run equilibrium rates is regularly initiated by considerations on the prevalence of allegedly "irrational" exchange rate fluctuations, that is major deviations from equilibrium. The present paper demonstrates that despite this problematic situation, there exists a straightforward link between processes of international economic integration and the fundamental exchange rate behaviour.
The relevant theoretical basis is provided by monetary exchange rate models (Dornbusch (1976), Frankel (1979), and others), which connect the foreign exchange to influences of fundamental variables like income, money supply, interest rate and inflation. In time series econometrics, assessing the implied relationship has attracted a considerable quantity of empirical research; a comparison of modelling approaches is given in Cheung et al. (2005), while Meese and Rogoff (1983) represents a well-known critique. Methodologically, the standard approach has become testing for cointegration between the exchange rate and the fundamental variables of the involved countries, as demonstrated in MacDonald and Taylor (1991).
Moersch and Nautz (2001) however pointed out, that such "reduced-form" estimations lack clear economic interpretability and do not account for the presence of multiple cointegrating vectors in any meaningful way. While these authors stressed the importance of money demand functions and purchasing power parity (PPP) as building blocks of their empirical model, the underlying paper adopts an explicit cross-country perspective: In detail, I concentrate on the consequences of the state of international economic integration for the exchange rate of the involved countries. As such, the exchange rate is basically seen as the relative price of two currencies, which is determined by the interplay of according money demand and supply. Logically, bivariate cointegration between the corresponding determinants of those market forces rules out persistent shocks to the price and so can even lead to stationarity of the exchange rate. Such a situation should typically occur in case of extensive convergence between two countries, mainly regarding real, nominal and policy developments.
This conceptual approach, as described in more detail in the following section, merits featuring at least two points: On the one hand, it explicitly connects various theories of economic integration to the functioning of the foreign exchange. For example, this
1

involves an interesting view on prerequisites and desirability of common currency areas. On the other hand, useful guidelines for the empirical treatment of time series properties in the monetary exchange rate model are provided. For illustrational purposes, in section 3, I first demonstrate the effects of strong economic integration taking the relationship of Australia and New Zealand as an apparently suitable example. Afterwards, the exchange rate of the Australian dollar towards the world's leading currency, the US dollar, is considered as benchmark case. The last section summarises the main points of the investigation.

2 Economic Integration in a Monetary Model

An exchange rate describes the price of one currency in terms of another. Conventional monetary theory (e.g. Frankel 1979) consequently models this exchange relation as the outcome of the interaction between demand and supply of the involved monies. In a first step, the according domestic and foreign market equilibria can be specified as

mt - pt = yt - it - Et(t+1) ,

(1)

mt - pt = yt - it - Et(t+1) .

(2)

Therein, mt denotes log nominal per capita money, pt the log price level, yt log real per capita income, it a single-period interest rate, t = pt the according inflation rate and Et the conditional expectations operator. All coefficients are defined positive, since income naturally raises money demand, whereas the interest and inflation2 rates, repre-

senting opportunity costs of holding money, have an adverse effect. While long-run price

homogeneity is assumed in the term mt - pt, deviations are allowed in the short-run by  differing from zero. Regarding the income elasticity, one might expect a one-to-one

relationship with money demand, hence  = 1. In the present context, taking per capita

values is not typical, but proves useful for adopting the income convergence concept ex-

plained below; at the same time, the numerical effect should cancel out between the two

concerned aggregates money and income.

Through the price levels, the equilibria of national money demand and supply are con-

nected to the formation of the exchange rate st (defined as log domestic currency units per foreign currency). A very general type of sticky exchange rate adjustment mechanism

can be written as

Et(st+1) = -(st - st) + Et(t+1 - t+1) ,

(3)

2For further interpretation on the role of inflation, see Goldfeld and Sichel (1987).

2

where the equilibrium rate st = pt - pt following PPP. The expectations in (3) are formed assuming that per period, the exchange rate reacts to PPP disequilibria with the adjustment speed , which is usually found to take positive values close to zero. The expected inflation differential enters with strength , which I do not set to unity, because such a restriction would not be compatible with observed substantial deviations from PPP equilibrium.

As the last model equation, the uncovered interest rate parity (UIP) provides a link between exchange rate expectations and the interest differential:

Et(st+1) = it - it .

(4)

The zero arbitrage condition requires differences between nominal asset yields to be offset by expectations on revaluation of the currencies underlying the respective investments. The role of potential risk premia is not directly addressed in this paper.

Combining equations (1), (2), (3) and (4) leads to the following expression for the log

exchange rate:

(5)

Following straightforward intuition, the right hand side comprises the relations of the

variables governing the national monetary sectors: At first, excess supply of the domes-

tic currency logically raises (depreciates) the exchange rate. In contrast, high domestic income drives up money demand, leading to appreciation. With  normally taking very small values, the interest differential enters with a negative sign: High domestic yields attract capital inflows, which appreciate the exchange rate. Only for  growing large, the hypothetical case of continuous PPP and flexible prices, the adverse effect  on money demand would overweigh. Finally, domestic inflation expectations weaken the currency

in line with common sense theory.

From an econometric point of view, equation (5) raises the question of integration and cointegration of the variables. If as usually, exchange rates are treated as non-stationary, the level relationship from the monetary model implies cointegration with the fundamentals on the right hand side. However, taking into regard that all these variables appear as spreads between countries opens a different perspective: In case of sufficient crossborder similarity in real, nominal and policy processes, identical stochastic trends would cancel out in the different pairs of fundamentals and logically could not cause exchange rate non-stationarity. The next paragraph sketches the relevant theoretical approaches substantiating possible cointegration between the different variables of interest.

3

At first, real convergence in the sense of Bernard and Durlauf (1995) implies a stationary income differential: Since the presence of long-run comovement rules out persistent shocks to the output gap, per capita GDPs are in pairs cointegrated with the vector (1, -1). Furthermore, from the UIP (4) it can be seen that a stationary expectations term requires similarly a stationary interest rate spread for balancing the equation. Likewise, validity of relative PPP, here given by st = t-t, leads to a stationary inflation differential: Given the change on the left hand side is I(0), the I(1) inflation rates must be cointegrated with the vector (1, -1). Solely for the money supply term mt - mt , it is true that establishing a theoretical approach justifying stationarity is not equally clear-cut. Nonetheless, a stationary money spread could easily be imagined if central banks follow comparable monetary policies over time.
With all the above listed prerequisites fulfilled, the final equation (5) of the monetary model necessarily predicts a stationary exchange rate. Essentially, if all determinants of demand and supply in the domestic market for money cointegrate with their foreign counterparts, fluctuations in the relative price of the monies are strictly due to transitory deviations from the underlying fundamental equilibria. Obviously, this criterion states a certain "all-round" economic integration encompassing money, output, interest rate and inflation. In contrast, if one or more spreads are non-stationary, the stochastic trends representing permanent deviations from those "inexistent equilibria" should be directly picked up by the exchange rate through relation (5). Since this describes the case of cointegration, a stationary error correction term should exist between those variables, which affects the exchange rate development in addition to the stationary fundamentals spreads already representing distinct cointegrating relations. Notwithstanding this discussion, PPP still implies that the exchange rate non-stationarity is offset by the differing price level trends, leading to a stationary real exchange rate.
The above argumentation is based on validity of the monetary exchange rate model. In this, the factors contributing to exchange rate movements are evidently restricted to the ones from the underlying fundamental theory. The following applications will show that this view is not inappropriate for tackling the main point of this paper, namely the connection of exchange rate behaviour to economic convergence. Nevertheless, depending on the concrete empirical example, further variables such as government spending or oil prices can clearly be thought of exerting influence on model and time series properties of the exchange rate.

3 Empirical Evidence
3.1 Australia - New Zealand
This study exhibits the consequences of economic convergence between countries for the behaviour of their exchange rate. Therefore, before addressing the popular US dollar example, I first present a case of presumably far-reaching economic integration: Australia and New Zealand. Since 1983, the "Closer Economic Relations" agreement supports an over average growth of bilateral trade, direct investment and migration, amongst others. Today, Australia represents New Zealand's most important partner through all economic domains.
The Australian dollar was officially floated in December 1983, the New Zealand dollar in March 1985. Therefore, the sample comprises the period from 1985 to 2006. The following quarterly data was taken from OECD sources: The exchange rate is defined as quarterly end-of-period AUD/NZD, obtained through the no triangular arbitrage condition towards the US dollar. For the one-period interest rate, annualised yields of 90-day bank bills are employed. The inflation rate is calculated as the first difference of the X-12 seasonally adjusted log GDP deflator, multiplied by 400 in order to attain annualised percentage points. Thereby, the one-period ahead expectations are approximated by real ex-post values, as it is common under the assumption of rationality. Income is represented by GDP and money by broad money supply M3, both transformed to real 2000 purchasing power US dollar, using the respective GDP deflators and PPP conversion factors from the International Comparison Program of the World Bank. Furthermore, GDP and M3 are seasonally adjusted and calculated per capita, dividing by (linearly interpolated) total population. All time series are presented in Figure 1.
Without going into detail, a close comovement becomes apparent for all pairs of economic aggregates. The exchange rate surely reveals a strong autocorrelation structure, but nonetheless, a tendency of mean reverting can be deduced from the graph. This impression shall be checked by formal unit root tests, since analysing the long-run properties of the monetary exchange rate model requires establishing the degree of integration of the involved variables in a first step. For the empirical procedure, exchange rate, GDP and money are logged and multiplied by 100. Table 1 displays the ADF test results for the null hypothesis of non-stationarity, defining Australia as the domestic and New Zealand as the foreign country. The lag lengths are chosen by the usual information criteria, and a linear trend is included for the visibly ascendant series.

Table 1: ADF tests for Australian and New Zealand data

Whereas the exchange rate is found clearly stationary, all the other variables are integrated of order one. This constellation implies that in (5), a stationary exchange rate is explained by a set of non-stationary regressors. A balanced equation therefore depends on common stochastic trends, which cancel out between the corresponding domestic and foreign variables. For the purpose of checking up on this kind of cointegration, Table 2 presents ADF tests performed on the respective international differentials.
Since the four spreads are found stationary, they can be treated as cointegrating relations in an error correction model. Additionally, the lagged exchange rate level can be interpreted as a single-variable stationary relation, which is necessary for avoiding misspecification. This view is supported by a trace test3 (Johansen 1995), which confirms the presence of five cointegrating relations between the nine variables on the 5% level, but yields no evidence for any higher rank. Hence, I specify an error correction equation for

the exchange rate, initially containing the cointegrating relations, a constant and a linear trend. In order to enhance efficiency and allow for endogeneity, I add according equations for the remaining eight variables, which form a system of vector error correction type estimated in a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) framework. Even though the Schwarz and Hannan-Quinn criteria suggested a lag length of zero, in case Breusch-Godfrey tests indicated residual autocorrelation, additional autoregressive lags were added to the particular equation. Regressors insignificant at the 10% level were sequentially deleted from the system. Finally, with standard errors in parentheses below the parameters, the exchange rate equation resulted as

As the money spread clearly failed to reach significance, it has been removed. All re-

maining coefficients carry the expected signs, describing the appreciating effect of GDP

and interest rate as well as the depreciating effect of inflation. The exchange rate is

included in levels, because it has been found stationary. Note that this represents a

simple autoregressive reparameterisation of the conventional error correction form, which

does not alter the underlying model structure. For calculating the long-run impacts on

the exchange rate, one has to take its lag polynomial into account. In this, the income

elasticity amounts to -0.37/(1 - 0.80 + 0.15) = -1.06, which is not different from the

expected -1 in a likelihood ratio (LR) test with a p-value of 0.87. Turning the attention

to interpreting the interest and inflation parameters, first recall that the annualisation

effectively requires quadrupling the estimates. The interest rate semi-elasticity results as

Stationarity of the exchange rate between the Australian and New Zealand currencies emerges as a product of its determinants being cointegrated. In this, each of the according

cross-country long-run equilibria has to be maintained by systematic adjustment taking place in at least one of the countries. Logically, leadership in the international relations can be discussed in this context as an additional feature: In the above-mentioned SUR errorcorrection equations for income, interest rate, inflation and money, without exception the New Zealand variables react significantly stronger to equilibrium deviations than their Australian counterparts. Those might not be completely weakly exogenous, but Australia clearly catches the leading role in the bilateral relations.4

3.2 Australia - United States

For Australia and New Zealand, extensive economic integration appropriately explains exchange rate stationarity in the light of the argumentation from section 2. Now, this section shall provide complementary evidence on the external relations of Oceania. For this purpose, I concentrate on Australia because of its size and probable leading role; thereby, representing the common benchmark case, the United States are chosen as the foreign country. Basically, the same comments on data as in the forestanding section apply. However, the sample can now already start in 1984:1, comprising the whole AUD floating period. The US interest rate is represented by the 3-month CD rate, and money supply now by narrow money M1, which produced much more logical results than M3. The graphs are displayed in Figure 2.

Apparently, the comovement proves much weaker than in the case of New Zealand. Especially the policy-relevant variables M1 and short-term interest rate do not seem to be predominantly governed by common forces. Before addressing cointegration, at first Table 3 gives an idea about data integration.

Table 4: ADF tests for Australian - US differentials

Obviously, the income convergence and relative PPP hypotheses can be maintained. In contrast, no cointegration is found for the money supply5 and interest rate pairs, respectively. Even though only ADF results are displayed, various alternative methods equally failed in establishing cointegration. In the case of Australia and New Zealand, it was probably comparable monetary policies in addition to real and nominal coherence, which led to exchange rate stationarity. Whereas integration in the real sector also seems to take place between Australia and the US, the policy-relevant variables money supply and short-term interest rate evidently follow distinct idiosyncratic courses. Undoubtedly, sustainability of these deviations from the guidelines of the superpower US is supported by

the stable and freely floating Australian currency. As the case may be, the stochastic trending of the exchange rate is obviously triggered by persistencies in the money and interest rate behaviour.

Before an empirical monetary model can be specified, it is necessary to verify cointegration between the non-stationary variables exchange rate, M1 differential and interest rate spread. A trace test (with constant, trend and no lags, as suggested by the Schwarz and Hannan-Quinn criteria) can reject the hypothesis of no cointegrating relation with a p-value of 0.03, but a higher rank is not within reach. When the cointegrating parameter of the exchange rate is normalised to unity, restricting the money coefficient to -1 cannot be rejected by an LR test (p-value = 0.13). Therefore, I follow equation (5) in specifying the error correction term as st - (mt - mt) + (it - it ), where  is still to be estimated in the SUR model.

The same proceeding as in the previous section leads to the exchange rate equation

st

-0.15t-0.74(yt-1 (0.04) (0.18)

)]+(00..5223)(t-t).

(7)

Again, the signs of the coefficients do not lack plausibility. For determining the long-run

impacts quantitatively, again the lag polynomial in the level representation of (7) has

to be considered. While the money elasticity had already been restricted to unity, the

high6 values for interest rate (4.87) and inflation (0.53/(1 - 0.89) = 4.82) are likely to be

explained by a low PPP adjustment parameter ; in contrast, evidence from the previous

section showed that deviations from the law of one price between Australia and New

Zealand are probably corrected much faster. With an elasticity of 0.74/(1 - 0.89) = 6.73,

the development of the GDP differential exerts an extraordinary effect on the exchange

rate.

4 Concluding Summary
In a word, this paper demonstrated the influence of real and nominal economic integration processes between two countries on their exchange rate. Theoretically, the monetary approach connects the fundamental variables money, income, interest rate and inflation to the value of the currency. In case of cross-country convergence of these determinants, marked by stationary international differentials, exchange rate stationarity comes as a

logical consequence. Therefore, this can be interpreted as a criterion for full economic integration in real, nominal and policy terms.
An interesting implication refers to the theory of the optimal size of currency unions between countries: In case of symmetric behaviour of the most important macroeconomic variables, maintaining an autonomous monetary policy exclusively orientated towards domestic needs loses its necessity. By the same token, the importance of absorbing countryspecific shocks through reactions of a flexible exchange rate would shrink considerably, since in presence of cointegration, the concerned variables will revert to their long-run equilibria.7 Consequently, this describes a situation, where potential merits of a common currency are likely to exceed the costs, which are mainly connected to the loss of sovereign monetary policy and exchange rate flexibility.
As an intuitive example, such a constellation has been shown characterising the relationship of Australia and New Zealand. The differentials between the fundamentals money, income, interest rate and inflation were interpreted as cointegrating relations affecting the course of the exchange rate as implied by the monetary model. Besides favouring a common currency area, the results give support to the current political efforts in creating a unified internal market in the two Oceanic countries.
In contrast, money and interest rate of the United States did not cointegrate with their Australian counterparts, indicating substantial differences mainly in monetary policy. Nevertheless, cointegration between the exchange rate and the money and interest differentials led to a sensible specification of the monetary model. Therefore, the nonstationarity of the AUD/USD exchange rate is evidently linked to the stochastic trending factors in interest rates and monies. Of course, depending on the exact choice of data, sample, methodology and model specification one may in general arrive at differing conclusions about the cointegrating properties of the model variables. Nevertheless, the two empirical case studies exemplify the essential principal behind the present economic approach.
The main contribution of the underlying study lies in explicitly connecting convergence processes to the foreign exchange and uniting basic economic intuition with formalised econometrics. Analysing the time-series properties of the theoretically relevant variables allows both determining areas of strong economic integration as well as identifying the sources of non-stationary exchange rate behaviour. In this respect, the current approach should therefore be able to improve on precedent exchange rate modelling. Admittedly,
7In addition, synchronous cycles would reduce the persistency of those transitory movements.
11

broad empirical evidence on exchange rate properties seems to make it unlikely finding a relevant number of cases fulfilling the stationarity criterion. Even so, many pairs of countries, which are generally under-represented in the US dollar oriented literature and for which the perspective of a common currency might appear promising, probably bear a definite potential for future research.
