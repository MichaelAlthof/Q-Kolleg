Dynamical systems forced by shot noise as a new paradigm in the interest rate modeling
Alexander L. Baranovski (WestLB AG)

Abstract. In this paper we give a generalized model of the interest rates term structure including Nelson-Siegel and Svensson structure. For that we introduce a continuous mfactor exponential-polynomial form of forward interest rates and demonstrate its considerably better performance in a fitting of the zero-coupon curves in comparison with the well known Nelson-Siegel and Svensson ones. In the sequel we transform the model into a dynamic model for interest rates by designing a switching dynamical system of the considerably reduced dimension n < m generating the forward rate curves in form a c‡dl‡g function. A system is described by n-th order linear differential equation driven by a stochastic or chaotic shot noise. From fitted forward rates we specify the parameters of the switching system and discuss perspectives of our models to produce term-structure forecasts at both short and long horizons.
Keywords: forward interest rates, shot noise processes, switching dynamical systems, chaotic Brownian subordination, chaotic maps

1. Exponential-polynomial models of interest rates

We introduce an exponential-polynomial term structure model of interest rates by

l-1
f (t, Z ) = cl + f0 (t, Z ), f0 (t, Z ) = i (t)  exp(- it)
i=1

(1)

where

z

:=

{c1(1)

t > 0 denotes time to maturity T,

coefficients

c(i) k

;

k = 1,..., pi

k =1

( pi  {1,2,3,...}) and  i are positive real numbers. The total number of parameters in

l -1
(1) is m = pi + l .
i=1

We note that the widely used Nelson-Siegel (N-S) [Nelson 1987] and Svensson (SV) [Svensson 1994] families of f(t) can be easily derived from (1). Assuming l = 2 and p1 = 2 , p2 = 1, i.e. dimensionality m=4, (1) leads to N-S forward rate curve

fNS (t) = (c1(1) + c2(1)t)  exp(-1t) + c2

(2)

as well as the SV curve is given by

fSV (t) = (c1(1) + c2(1)t)  exp(-1t) + c1(2)  exp(- 2t) + c3

(3)

with l = 3, p1 = 2 and p2 = 1, p3 = 1 i.e. m = 6.

Another special case of (1) is a curve of the exponentials mixture under pi = 1, i , i.e.

l -1
fEXP (t) = ci  exp(-  it ) + cl
i =1

(4)

We show that a performance of a new term structure (1) in a fitting of the yields is considerably higher of the well known Nelson-Siegel and Svensson ones. By other words a today's choice of the parameters in (1) is to be not limited by the state space Z  R 4 as for the N-S curve or Z  R6 in the Svensson model, i.e. Z  Rn , n  6 .

The corresponding term structure of the bond prices will be then given by

B(t, Z ) := exp -

2. ODE for the interest rate models

We establish that dynamics of the interest rates f (t) in a model (1) follows a n-th order ODE

 f (n) +

f +(n-1)
n-1

f (n-2)
n-2

+ ... + 1 f (1) +  0 f

=0

(5)

l -1
where n = pi + 1 , pi is the multiplicity of the root  i , i = 1,..., l
i=1

of the corresponding characteristic polynomial

n-1

D( ) =  n +

  n-i n-i

i =1

The coefficients of the ODE are given by the Vieta formula

Example (Nelson-Siegel).

Recall that the Nelson-Siegel model corresponds to the case l = 2 and p1 = 2 . Then

Thus, the corresponding differential equation is

It is easy to check that the Nelson-Siegel curve f (t) = c1 + (c2 + c3t)  exp(-1t)

is a general solution of the ODE as a combination of the two obvious particular

solutions of

Eq. (9) has a vector solution f (t ) = eF()t f (0) .

such

that

the

processes

cij ( ) depend on the stochastic processes { 1 ( ),..., l-1 ( )} and the short rates (initial
conditions) as shown by (8) for a Nelson-Siegel term structure.
Taking into account (9), (10) the evolution of the forward rates on the date  is given by

with the given vector  and initial state vector r (0, ) .

Assuming Z is given  ≠ evolution of r (t, ) can be described by two different ways. First one presents  ≠ evolution of r (t, ) as a train of curves (12) for dates  = 1, 2,... in a form (see Fig. 1)

 = f (0, Z +1 ) - f (T , Z ) .

(14)

We call the vector i as the stochastic amplitude of the impulse perturbation, which acts on system (13) at times t = T,  = 1,2,3, .... such that

r( T + 0, ) = r( T - 0, ) +  .
Thus r is a cadlag function, i.e. a right continuous function r( T + 0, )  r( T , ),
defined on Rn and has a left limit. Between kicks iT and (i +1)T a state vector is governed by the homogeneous system of linear differential equations (12) at  = i+1.

where we denote 0  r(0).

The second approach is based on a simple idea to express a random variable f (t, Z )

( )by f t, Z fixed +  (t ) in the interval 0  t  T . By other words we assume that
dynamics of the interest rates r (t, ) can be modelled by

dr = F r dt + d, 0  t  T , 

(15)

( )where F is a n x n matrix with the constant coefficients i  i  fixed for any  . The
model (15) generates a predicted term structure, whose exponential-polynomial shape depends on the model parameters and the initial short rate. One can show that (15) is more general and includes a class of equilibrium models such as Vasicek, CIR, lognormal models.

3. Approach I ≠ demonstrating example: from estimating the yield curve to its dynamic modelling

First we empirically estimate process Z . For that we are going to fit the default-free yield spreads, downloaded from the Reuters database. The observable time period is 23.02. 2006 ≠ 14.01. 2008, i.e. contains q = 478 dates. In framework of the above exponential-polynomial approach we introduce a term structure model of yields curves by

Y

(t,

Z)

f

(16)

(16) can be easily done in a closed form. For this we need the relation [Prudnikov 1981]

We introduce a minimization criterion as:

min Z

(18)

where {si ( ), i = 1,2,..., N } are quotes of the yields on the base date  . The cost
l -1
function ( ) is to be minimized by the appropriate choice of the m = pi + l
i=1
parameters of the state space Z. It is clear that in the fitting problem the following
restriction

m = dim(Z ) = l-1 pi + l  min({N , = 1,..., q})
i =1
is to be provided.

(19)

Given the number l of the parameters  l , i = 1,...,l and distribution of their multiplicities pl , i = 1,..., l such that the condition (19) holds the nonlinear regression technique for the least squares criterion (18) leads to the minimum of the cost function

with the obvious restrictions for the parameters

(20)

l, p1,K, pl  Z + = {1,2,3,...}.

(21)

We note that (20) according to a law of large numbers/ Birkhoff ergodic theorem approaches the mean of the stochastic/ chaotic cost function with q   .

The above calculated m + l + 1 parameters specify a general term structure model of interest rates by the exponential-quadratic curves (1) ( pl = 3 ) as well as a general term structure model of yields by the exponential-cubic curves (17).

Fig. 2 demonstrates a performance of the general model for the Euro swap rates by comparison of its cost function (18) with the cost functions of the conventional Nelson-Siegel and Svensson models and exponential model (4) with l = 6.

Fig. 4 Fitted zero curves on the spot date 25.03.08
Repeating a fitting procedure to the another date, let's say  +1 = 26.03.08, we get a similar set of the base curves (16) which can be described by the system (13), where the impulse perturbation  (14) is to be predetermined.
As an example we design a dynamical system for N-S instantaneous forward rate curve
r(t, ) = c1( ) + (c2( ) + c3( )t ) exp(-t) described by the following low-dimensional ODE

where

according to (10) and (14).

(24)

From the output of the above fitting procedure we retrieve the time series
{c1( ),c2 ( ),c3 ( ),  = 1,2,K, q = 478} for the observable time period.

Applying (24) we immediately get time series of stochastic perturbation. Let us introduce the k-th order increments for both processes  ,   by

k +1 = k +1 - k

(25)

k+1  = k   +1 - k   ,

We are now able to do an elementary statistical analysis of both processes  ,   .

4. Approach II ≠ forcing signal as a shot noise
We note that applying Vieta formula (7) at j = n the coefficient 0 is equal to zero since  l = 0 . It implies that a general solution of the ODE (5) is a combination of the obvious solution of f  = 0 and the particular solution (t) of

f + f(n-1)

(n-2) n-1

+

f (n-3)
n-2

+ ... + 1 f

=0

(30)

i.e. f = r   + c .
We are specifically interested in the behaviour of the system (30) with a shot noise as a chaotic/stochastic perturbation, i.e.

where tk are successive occurrence or arrival times of -impulses,

t0 (= 0) < t1 < ... < tk < ... < T

N (t) = max{k : tk  t} is a counting process.

The impulse perturbation acts on system (31) at times t = tk, k = 1,2,3, .... such that
(tk + 0) = (tk - 0) + Ak .

(32)

In sequel we assume that  is a c‡dl‡g function.
We introduce the positive inter-arrival times Tk such that
k
tk = tk -1 + Tk = Ti

Between kicks a state vector is governed by the following homogeneous system of linear
15

differential equations d =F dt
and the initial condition of the system 0  (t0 + 0) defines an evolution of a state vector
(Cauchy theorem). 4.1. One-dimensional case We consider a special case of (31) in a form of one-dimensional ODE:

where Pk (t ) = (P tk-1  t < tk ) = P ( N (t ) = k ) .

We assume zero mean for the magnitudes Ak . It immediately implies that (t) is a martingale with a zero mean

E ( ) = E ( N (t )) E ( A) = 0 ( A = 0) as E ( | N (t )) = N (t ) E ( A)

(36)

To calculate a variance of  (t) we use a law of total variance
D ( ) = E D ( | N (t )) + D E ( | N (t ))

One can show that the conditional variance is

Hence, for i.i.d. random or uncorrelated chaotic magnitudes Ak (cA(k)=0) we have

( )Let

us

introduce

a

new

variable

k

= k -k k

with E (k ) = 0 and E k2

= 1 . It can be

shown that k converges in distribution to the standard normal law, i.e. the central limit theorem holds both with i.i.d.random [Feller] and chaotic magnitudes Ak [Chernov 1995]. In [Baranovski 2003], authors have presented the analytical expressions for the characteristic functions of the chaotic partial sums k of the magnitudes Ak generated by PWL onto maps

( )and shown their fast convergence to the limit exp - 2 / 2 .

We consider a piecewise constant function Wk (t ) on t  [0,1] such that

WL (t ) =

k t

=

D( A) L

D( A)

kt 
Ai , L i =1

t [0,1], k = 0,1,..., L

where x is the floor function (it gives the greatest integer less than or equal to x).

(41)

Then for any k {Wk } induces a measure on the space of continuous functions on [0,1] .
According to the invariance principle this measure converges weakly, as k   , to the
Wiener process W [Chernov 1995 ] Fig. 10 depicts examples of functions {Wk } for different
k when the magnitudes Ak are chaotic variables generated by a tent map on [-1,1]:

The weak invariance principle known also as the functional central limit theorem provides an approximation deterministic dynamical systems by a Brownian motion on large space and time scales.
Thus the distribution of (t) tends to the Gaussian law with the mean (36) and variance (38).
This confirms the diffusion character of (t). It follows that the Eq. (33) can be used for stochastic and chaotic modeling of the Wiener process.

Example 1. Valuation of the European call option.

The underlying asset of the European option is assumed to grow at the constant risk-free rate r

perturbed by a stochastic/chaotic marked point process (t). Thus an asset price is modeled as

Properties:

dS = rdt + d S

(43)

1) Markov property: the next asset price (S+dS) depends solely on today's price

2) The next value for S is higher than the old by an amount

3) Variance of dS is

E (dS ) = rSdt (as E (d ) = 0)

( )( )D (dS ) = E dS 2 - E2 (dS ) = E S 2 (d )2 = S 2D (d ) = S 2D ( A) dH (t )

For a case of i.i.d. random values Ak (46) simplifies to

(47)

k () = 1k ()

(48)

where 1() = eix pA (x)dx is the characteristic function of the distribution of Ak .


Here we focus on a special case of (46) when the magnitudes Ak are generated by a chaotic mapping

Ak = (Ak-1 )

(49)

in an interval X.

A joint pdf does not factorize in this case and calculates as
k -1
pA (x1, x2 ,..., xk ) = pA (x1)   (xi+1 -  (i) (x1)) , i =1
where pA (x) is the invariant density of the map  .

(50)

The goal equation (46) simplifies for piece-wise linear onto maps
 ( x) = {i ( x) = ai x + bi , x  Ji ,i = 1, 2,..., m

such that i : : Ji  X = (0,1) .

We collect their main probabilistic properties:

4.2. Case of simple real roots of a characteristic polynomial

We consider the case when the characteristic polynomial of the system (31) has simple real negative roots  i , i = 1, 2,..., n -1. The Routh-Hurwitz theorem provides necessary conditions for that. By introducing the following two matrices

1





=

(56)

The solution of (31) is then given by:

(t) = E(t)Dk , at tk-1  t < tk

(57)

( )where the vector of constants Dk = D1(k) ,K, Dn(k-1) T can be specified from the initial
conditions (tk-1) by Dk = E(- tk-1 ) -1(tk-1 )
As  is a c‡dl‡g we first get for t = 0 (k = 1)

(58)

(+0)  0 =   E(0)  D1  D1 = -1 0

then from (32) one can show that for t = tk-1
(tk -1)  (tk -1 + 0) =   E(tk -1) Dk (=  tk -1 - 0) + Ak -1  ( )  E tk -1  Dk -1 + Ak -1 (59)
It leads to a recurrent equation:

( )Dk = Dk-1 + E -tk  -1Ak-1

with a solution

24

where (t0 ) = 0 .

k -1
Dk = -10 + E(- l )-1Al ,
l =1

(60)

Substituting (60) into (57) leads to a general solution of (31) as a mixture of the magnitudes of the all previous kicks in the system:

k -1
(t) = E(t)-10 + E(t - tl )-1Al , at tk -1  t < tk
l =1

(61)

From (59) and (58) we derive

( ) ( )Ak-1 =  tk-1 -   E Tk  -1  k-2

(62)

Using (61) Eq. (62) transforms to
( ) ( )  ( )k-2
Ak-1 =  tk-1 - E tk -1 -10 - E tk-1 - tl -1  Al .
l =1

The inverse matrix -1 exists as the Vandermonde determinant det() does not equal to zero and for large time t

A stationary mode is then established by the second term in (61).

4.2.1. Periodic perturbation: the inter-arrival times are equal to 

Now we start to analyze the statistical properties of the stationary mode of process (t) of a system (31) forced by a periodic shot noise. Let amplitudes Ai(p) be independent zero mean random values with the probability density function: pAi (x,t), i = 1,2,..., n - 1 common for all p, i.e. t ; Ai(k ) and Aj(m) are mutually
25

independent values i  j, j{1,...,n-1}, k, m . Then from (58) the stationary mode is given by

4.2.2. Asymptotic properties of (t)

We introduce the following notations: an exponential pulse shape gi (z) = eiz , an amplitude
26

A%k(i)

=

A e .(i) - i(k -1) k

Taking

into

account

that

k

-1

=

 

t 

 

for

an

arbitrary

interval

(k -1) < t < k ,

the

process

(t)

can be rewritten in the following form

n-1
(t) = zi (t) ,
i=1

where

zi (t)

=

A%i(k ) gi

 

t 

mod1

is a sequence of

pulses adjoining to each other

with given

form gi = gi(z) at 0 < z  1and random amplitudes distributed on pA(i) (x),i and fixed

duration  .

The characteristic function of the process (t) factorizes:

nn
 (u, t) = E(e jx(t)u ) = E(e jzi (t)u ) = i (u, t) i =1 i=1
and the distribution function:

F ( y, t) = P((t)  y)

can be easily calculated by use of the inverse theorem.

The mean value is given by

  ( ) n
ydF ( y,t) = E ((t)) = E

Then one can show that a Lindeberg condition [Feller 1968] is satisfied:

4.2.3. An empirical model
Let us consider an exponential term structure of interest rates (4) with l = 6 which is characterized by a performance (22) . For that we fix a dimension n = 6 of a system (31)
and set Tk =  as well as an arbitrary time t in a k-th interval t  (k -1) , k) .

According to the second approach (read discussion in section 2 and equation (15) take a spectrum of the eigenvalues by

1 = -4.21,  2 = -2.68,  3 = -1.94,  4 = -3.83,  5 = -1.59

(68)

corresponding to the median fitted curve of the instantaneous forward rate on the date

 fixed = 255 (22.02.2007) . From the eigenvalues we calculate the matrix  and its inverse

-1 .

Above fitting procedure provides a sample of trajectories

(69)

( ( ) ) ( )where c fix = cl  fix , 0, K, 0 T , cl  fix  c6 (255)  0.043

28

We rewrite Eq. ( 62) in the form

Ak ( ) =  (k  ) -   E()  -1   ((k -1)  )

(70)

and calculate the sample central moments of the magnitudes Ak

The central moments of the magnitudes A1(k ) are given by the following empirical relations:

The central moments of the magnitudes A(jk ), j = 2,3,K, n -1demonstrate also the following patterns: the even moments

(74)

where the constants i(k), i(k) can be tabulated.

4.2.4. A chaotic model

29

Here we discuss an inverse problem: how to design a dynamical system (31) forming process (t) with the given statistical properties. For that we need to provide a generator of the magnitudes with the prescribed properties discussed above.
We will consider a case when the vector of magnitudes Ak is given by

Ak = (0, 0,K, 0, Ak )T ,

(75)

where the magnitudes are chaotic variables. It means that a just (n-2)-th derivative of a
solution (t) changes by jump Ak , which is governed by a chaotic map Ak =  ( Ak-1 ) .

The system coefficients k are coupled with the eigenvalues {1,K, }n-1 by Vieta's formula.

Without loss of generality we fix an arbitrary time t in a k-th interval t  (k -1) , k) . Then

from (61) the stationary mode is given by

linear system (31) forced by chaotic shot noise is normally distributed process. From the eigenvalues (68) by use of Vieta's formulas we define the coefficients i , i = 0,1,2,3,4 leading to the following 5th order differential equation

 (V ) +14.24  (IV ) + 82.25 + 208.81 + 267.94 +132.77  = Ai (t - i  ) (83)

The equation has a solution (76) at j = 0.

We assume that the amplitudes Ak of the impulse perturbation are chaotic uncorrelated variables with zero mean. Then from (79) we get

It is clear from Fig.23 that a dynamical system (70) demonstrates "expansion", characterized

by exponential growth of the variances

2 j

with

j, order of derivative of the solution (t).

A characteristic function of  j (t) can be analytically obtained. We first establish that the map (87) is topologically equivalent to a tent map (51) with the parameters
{(a1 = 2,b1 = 0) ,(a2 = -2,b1 = 2)} . A corresponding homeomorphism is the following linear
function 2b  x - b; b = 1.095 [Baranovski&Daems 1995] . It implies that a characteristic
function (81) of the solution  j (t) in a k-th interval t  (k -1) , k) is given by

Conclusions
In this paper we have first proposed an exponential-polynomial model of the interest rates and then demonstrated its performance in a fitting of the zero-coupon curves. Capturing dynamic dependencies in the fitted curves we have in a second step designed a dynamical system forced by shot noise with chaotic/stochastic jumps. In our proposed class the mean-reversion speed of the diffusive and the jump part can be adjusted separately or jointly by a suitable design of chaotic maps with prescribed probabilistic properties.
