Abstract
Inflation expectation is an important indicator for policy makers and financial investors. To capture a more accurate real-time estimate of inflation expectation on the basis of financial markets, we propose an arbitrage-free term structure model across different countries. We first estimate inflation expectation by modeling the nominal and the inflation-indexed bond yields jointly for each country. The joint dynamic model for inflation expectation is a cross sectional state space model combined with a GeoCopula model, which accounts for the default risk and the non Gaussian dependency structure over countries. We discover that the extracted common trend for inflation expectation is an important driver for each country of interest. Moreover, the model extracts informative estimates of inflation expectations and will provide good implications for monetary policies.

1 Introduction
Today most economists favour a low and steady rate of inflation because it facilitates real wage adjustments in the presence of downward nominal wage rigidity. Hence one of the major objectives of modern monetary policy is to bring inflation expectation under control, which is considered to be the first step in controlling inflation. Meanwhile, hedging the risk around the inflation forecast becomes more attractive in financial markets, as many investors rely on the stability and predictability of future inflation levels. Moreover, price stability is of immense importance to sustain social welfare, job opportunities and economic upturn. The objective of price stability refers to the general level of prices in the economy which implies avoiding both prolonged inflation and deflation. Inflation expectation that is involved in a contemporary macroeconomic framework anticipates future economic trends, will further affect monetary decisions. Since there is large demand on having reasonable estimates of inflation expectation levels, a large amount of literature has focused on analysing the government conventional and inflation-indexed bonds, which can implicitly provide a vast amount of information about the expectations of nominal and real interest rates obtained from the market. Such estimates are known to be an important complement to the estimates provided from the survey data. Despite the fact that inflation indexed bonds have been more frequently and widely issued in recent times, one would still have great difficulties in integrating the market information from multiple countries to get individual level estimates of the inflation expectation. The major problems lie in the relative short period of data availability and the existence of a lot of missing values. While the existing literature's focus is mainly on specific country, we would like to consider an estimation framework that allows us to analyse the co-movement of inflation expectation for multiple countries, and also provide country specific estimates of inflation expectation(IE) and the inflation risk premium (IRP).

MTS_BEIR

The starting point of our research is to analyse the break-even inflation rate (BEIR), which is known to be the difference between the yield on a nominal fixed-rate bond and the real yield on an inflation-linked bond of the same maturity and similar credit quality. The BEIR can generally indicate how the inflation expectations are priced into the market. However they are not a perfect measure for IEs, as they may also encompass inflation risk premium, liquidity premium and technical market factors. In Figure 1 we observe the BEIR for five European countries - U.K., Germany, France, Italy and Sweden with maturity of three years. A fall in consumer prices appears since September 2009 due to a drop in energy costs, which exhibits some degree of co-movement. It is known that the euro-zone annual inflation rate was recorded at -0.2 percent in December of 2014 which matches, but is slightly higher than the overall BEIR shown in the Figure. This motivates us to extract a joint time-varying structure of IEs estimated from individual (country-specific) BEIR in a multiple country framework.
The modelling of BEIR requires a model for the joint dynamics of the nominal and the

3

real yields. For instance, Härdle and Majer (2014) investigated the yield curves using a Dynamic Semiparametric Factor Model (DSFM). To adopt a real time approach to access the term structure of nominal and inflation-linked yields, we consider a three-factor term structure model motivated by Nelson and Siegel (1987). The attractiveness of NelsonSiegel factor models is due to its convenient affine function structure and good empirical performance. Diebold and Li (2006) extend the original Nelson-Siegel model to a dynamic environment. Theoretically, the Nelson-Siegel (NS) model does not ensure the absence of arbitrage opportunities, as shown by Bjork and Christensen (1999). Christensen, Diebold and Rudebusch (2011) further develop the NS model to an AFNS model by imposing the arbitrage-free hypothesis, which reflects most of the real activities of financial markets. The standard approaches for pricing forwards, swaps are all derived from such arbitrage arguments for both complete and incomplete markets. In our paper, we will use an AFNS model for the dynamics of the nominal and the real yield respectively, and combine the two models afterwards.
Based on the joint dynamics of the nominal and the real yields, a sizable amount of literature has analysed how to isolate IE and IRP from BEIR. Earlier work mainly focuses on U.K. data because the U.K. was one of the first developed economies to issue inflationindexed bonds for institutional investors. With the first U.K. index-linked gilts issued in 1981, various developments have occured in the international markets. Barr and Campbell (1997) estimate market expectations of real interest rates and inflation from observed prices of U.K. government nominal and inflation-linked bonds. Joyce, Lildholdt and Sorensen (2010) develope an affine term structure model to decompose forward rates to obtain IRP. Notably, Christensen, Lopez and Rudebusch (2010) use an affine arbitragefree model of the term structure to decompose BEIR that captures the pricing of both nominal and inflation-indexed securities. A four-factor joint AFNS model was achieved by combining the AFNS models for nominal and inflation-linked yields, which proved to be efficient for fitting and forecasting analysis. Unlike Christensen et al. (2010), we align the four factor models over different maturities to make the factors consistent over maturities.
With the AFNS model for the joint dynamics on hand, we proceed with our European
4

country analysis. Most of the existing literature mentions little about the story of multiple countries. Diebold, Li and Yue (2008) are the first to consider a global multiple country model for nominal yield curves. There are a few European central bank reports, which focus on household and expert inflation expectation and the anchoring of inflation expectations in the two currency areas before and during the 2008 crisis, examples are Pflueger and Viceira (2011). Here we would like to look into five industrialised European countries by constructing a joint model of country-specific IEs. We construct an AFNS model in multi-maturity term structure for modelling nominal and inflation-indexed bonds simultaneously, and we also propose a joint model of IE dynamics over European countries, which discovers the extracted common trend for IE as an important driver for each country of interest. The GeoCopula model allows us to further understand the non-Gaussian dependency structures across countries. Then we conduct an analysis to explore the estimated common factor by decomposing the variation into parts driven by common effect variation and macroeconomic effect variation. The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents the joint AFNS model in a multi-maturity term structure for estimating yields of nominal and inflation-linked bonds, and also introduces the decomposition method of BEIR. In section 3, we explain GeoCopula model and discuss the econometric methodology used in the joint modelling of IE dynamics. The technical details are in the Appendix. The empirical results are shown in Section 4. Finally section 5 concludes and introduces further works.
2 Preliminary Analysis
In this section, we introduce a methodology to obtain the model-implied BEIR. Subsection 2.1 briefly introduces the Nelson-Siegel model, and subsection 2.2 constructs the joint AFNS structure for modelling nominal and inflation-indexed bonds. Subsection 2.3 introduces the joint AFNS model across countries in a multi-maturity term structure. Finally
5

in the subsection 2.4, we describe the decomposition method of BEIR.

2.1 A factor model representation

The classic Nelson-Siegel (NS) yield curve model for fitting static yield curves is with simple functional form,

y( ) = 0 + 1

1 - e- 

+ 2

1 - e- - e- 

(1)

where y( ) is a zero-coupon yield with  months to maturity, and 0, 1, 2 and  are parameters. This model is popular because it is simple and tractable. For a fixed value of parameter , i with i = 1, 2, 3 can be estimated by the ordinary least square method. Maturity  determines the decay speed of parameters.
The aforementioned dynamic version of Nelson-Siegel (DNS) model enables institutional investors and policy makers to understand the evolution of the bond market over time, the DNS model can be written as,

yt( ) = Lt + St

1 - e- 

+ Ct

1 - e- - e- 

(2)

where yt( ) denotes continuously zero-coupon yields of maturity  at time t. The timevarying factors are defined as level Lt, slope St and curvature Ct. Such choice of the latent factors is motivated by principal component analysis, which gives us three principal components corresponding to the latent factors. For instance, the most variation of yields is accounted by the first principal component - level factor Lt.
By incorporating the arbitrage-free assumption over  , the AFNS model brings the best of the Nelson-Siegel model and the Arbitrage-Free model. Thus, the AFNS model consists of two equations by taking the structure of the DNS model and the real-world dynamics

6

(under P-measure) derived from the AF model respectively,

yt( ) = Xt1 + Xt2

1 - e- 

+ Xt3

1 - e- - e- 

- A( ) 

dXt = KP (P - Xt)dt + dWtP

(3)

where Xt

factors,

A( )

adjustment term depending on maturity  . KP and P correspond to drifts and dynamics

terms, and are both allowed to vary freely.  is identified as a diagonal volatility matrix.

2.2 A joint factor model

The AFNS structure is a useful representation for term structure research. Christensen et al. (2010) employ and conduct a separate AFNS model estimation of nominal and inflation-linked Treasury bonds respectively. In this Subsection, we construct an extended AFNS structure for modelling nominal and inflation-indexed bonds simultaneously.
The AFNS model of nominal and inflation-indexed bond yields for a specific country i can be written respectively as,

yiNt ( ) = LiNt + SiNt yiRt ( ) = LRit + SiRt

1 - e-i i
1 - e-i i

+ CiNt + CiRt

1 - e-i - e-i i
1 - e-i - e-i i

- AiN ( ) 
- ARi ( ) 

where yiNt and yiRt represent the nominal and inflation-linked yields for country i at time t. To explore the relationship between nominal and inflation-indexed bond yields within a country, we need to combine two types and model them jointly.
To work with a simplified version of the yield curves, we impose an assumption on the correlation between the latent factors of nominal and inflation-indexed bonds. The empirical evidence can be found in Christensen et al. (2010). Furthermore, this assumption will be justified by the performance of the joint model illustrated in subsection 4.2. The

7

assumption takes the form of,

SiRt = iS SiNt CiRt = iC CiNt

(4)

Therefore the yield curve of the joint AFNS model can be written as,

   1 - e-i

yiNt ( )  
yiRt ( )

=

1 

0

iS

-ie-i i

The real-world dynamics (under P-measure) is,

dXt = KP (P - Xt)dt + dWtP where the vector of state variables Xit = LiNt , SiNt , CiNt , LiRt evolves dynamically.

2.3 Multiple Yield Curve Modelling
Diebold et al. (2008) extend the DNS model to a global version by modelling a potentially large set of yield curves for the countries around the world. This framework allows for both global and country-specific factors. Here we employ the joint AFNS model introduced in equation 5 and further extend it to a multiple-maturity case. For a specific country i, we first assume the vector of state variables Xit is a common factor for the yield curves across different maturities. Therefore the joint AFNS yield

where we recall that yiNt (n) and yiRt (n) represent the nominal and inflation-linked yields for country i at time t with maturity n. The real-world dynamics equation is in the same form as before,
dXtP = KP (P - Xt)dt + dWtP
where the vector of state variables Xit = LiNt , SiNt , CiNt , LiRt evolves dynamically. The joint AFNS yield curve model across countries will lead to a more efficient estimation. We demonstrate the goodness of fit of our model by showing the model residuals in subsection 4.4. We use the Kalman filter and maximum likelihood estimation for the state variables and parameters, the technical details are in Appendix A.

2.4 BEIR decomposition
In order to find a more appropriate measure of expected inflation, it is necessary to understand the components of the bond yields. A large literature has adopted a parametric approach to estimate the IE and risk premia using nominal and indexed bonds data, such as Adrian and Wu (2009), Campbell and Viceira (2009), Pflueger and Viceira (2011). They decompose the yield of an inflation-linked bond into current expectation of a future real interest rate and a real interest rate premium. The yield on a nominal bond can then be decomposed into parts of the yield on a real bond, expectations of future inflation and IRP. Therefore the spread between both yields, the BEIR, reflects the level of IE and IRP. In the context of an arbitrage-free model, it is assumed that investors have no opportunities to make risk-free profits. Thus the bonds can be priced by basic pricing equations according to Cochrane (2005),

Pt = Et {Mt+1xt+1} , where Mt+1 is a stochastic discount factor. Define

MN1: d=ef MR1: d=ef

MtN+1MtN+2 · · · MtN+ MtR+1MtR+2 · · · MtR+ ,

(7)
(8) (9)

where the nominal and the real (for inflation-linked bond) SDFs at time t are denoted by MtN and MtR. Then the prices of the zero-coupon bonds at time t, which pay one unit measured by the consumption basket at the time of maturity t +  , are formed as follows,

PtN ( ) = Et M1N: PtR( ) = Et M1R:

(10)

where PtN ( ) and PtR( ) represent the prices of nominal and real bonds respectively. The

10

price of the consumption basket, which is known as the overall price level Qt, has the following link with SDFs given the no arbitrage assumption,

(12)

that is,

BEIRt( ) = ytN ( ) - ytR( ) = t( ) + t( ) + t( ),

(13)

where t( ) is the IE, t( ) is the corresponding convexity effect and t( ) is IRP. To link the BEIRt( ) with the estimated state variables in equation 6, we assume that

11

the P-dynamics of the SDFs are,

dMtN MtN

-(rtN

- Nt-1)dWtP

dMtR MtR

=

rtR-1)dt

(tR

-

Rt-1)dWtP ,

(14)

where rtN = LtN + St, rtR = LRt + RSt, tN and tR represent the corresponding risk premium; their dynamics is connected to the underling state variables Xt in equation (6). More details are given in Appendix B. Hence the dynamics of the overall price level is,

d log

Qt-1 Qt

= -(rtN - rtR)dt + (rtN-1 - rtR-1)dt

d log (Qt) = (rtN - rtR)dt

(15)

The IE is given by

t( )

=

-1 

log

EPt

exp

t+
- (rsN - rsR)ds
t

(16)

which can be solved by a system of ODEs with a Runge-Kutta method, see Appendix B. The convexity effect can be written as

t( )

=

-

1 

EPt

log exp

t+
- (rsN - rsR)ds
t

(17)

Then the IRP can be easily calculated out by equation 13.

3 Econometric Modelling of Inflation Expectation
3.1 Global model for inflation expectation
Motivated by Diebold et al. (2008), the model can be extended to a framework that allows for both global and country-specific factors. As far as we have obtained the countryspecific estimates of IE, we build a model for multiple countries in this subsection. In particular, we allow the country-specific idiosyncratic factors to load on a common time-
12

varying factor and country-specific factors. The dynamics of an extracted common trend is also evaluated.
The model without a macroeconomic factor is structured as follows: the idiosyncratic factors ^iet for each country i at time t is loading on a common time-varying latent factor t,

^iet = mi + nit + uit

(18)

The dynamics of common factor is set as follows,

t = p + qt-1 + t

(19)

where m, n, p and q are unknown parameters. The errors t are assumed to be i.i.d., and the uit are modeled further in section 3.2.
Since there is a dynamic interaction between macro-economy and the yield curve as evidenced by Diebold, Rudebusch and Aruoba (2006), in Figure 1 we can observe that the decrease of the BEIR appears around 2012 due to the European sovereign debt crisis. A straightforward extension of the joint modelling equation (16) is adding a proxy of the macroeconomic factor - default risk factor. The model with a macroeconomic factor is,

^iet = mi + nit + lidit + uit

(20)

where dit is the default risk factor varying over time and m, n, p, l and q are all unknown parameters. In addition, to capture the joint dependency of the inflation expecation process across countries, uit is assumed to follow a non Gaussian GeoCopula process. And it is assumed to to be i.i.d white noise.

13

3.2 Spatial-temporal Copula
In this subsection, we explain the spatial-temporal copulae model adopted accounting for the non-Gaussian dependency across countries. A Spatial-temporal Copula process for the error term uit in equation (18) with t = 1, · · · , T , i = 1, . . . , N is described as follows,

uit = it + it,

(21)

where it captures majorly the spatial temporal variation and it is the Gaussian noise with mean 0 and variance , see Bai, Kang and Song (2014), and Xu (2015). Our Spatial-temporal Copula model is then formulated as,

Fit() = NT {-1(F11(11)), · · · , FN,T (NT )|},

(22)

wherefor NT (·) is the cumulative distribution function (c.d.f.) of a multivariate Gaussian distribution with a variance covariance matrix , which models the spatiotemporal dependence. Note that one can also generalize the framework to t distribution. According to the marginal closure property of Gaussian copulae, one can marginalize the high-dimensional c.d.f. in equation (22) into 2-dimensional marginals. Thus for any spatial temporal coordinate t1, n1 and t2, n2, the dependency can be expressed via a pairwise copulae model:

Ft,n(t1,n1 , t2,n2 ) = 2(-1(t1,n1 ), -1(t2,n2 )|t1,n1,t2,n2 ),

(23)

where t1,n1,t2,n2 is a submatrix of .

In this paper, we further parameterize t1,n1,t2,n2 by the function:

(n2 - n1, t2 - t1) = (v, u) d=ef

where a, b, ,  are parameters, () is the gamma function and K(·) is the Bessel function

of the second kind.

14

Denote ft,n(t1,n1, t2,n2) as the joint density of the two random variables. The estimator can be attained by maximizing joint composite log likelihood, see Varin (2008) .

log ft1n1 ,t2n2 ,

t1,t2,n1,n2: t1-t2 d1, n1-n2 d2

(24)

where  d=ef (a, b, , ) . Note that one still needs to choose the cut-off points d1, d2 for this methodology. In particular the density is

ft1,n1 ,t2,n2 d=ef c{F (t1,n1 ), F (t2,n2 )}f (t1,n1 )f (t2,n2 )

with

c{F (t1,n1 ), F (t2,n2 )} = |t1,n1,t2,n2 |-1/2 exp{q

and

4 Empirical Results
Subsection 4.1 describes the data. We then show the results for the fitting of the joint AFNS model in (6) for each country, and also evaluate the fitting performance by showing residuals of the fitting in Subsection 4.2. Subsection 4.3 analyzes the estimated country specific IEs. Subsequently subsection 4.4 jointly models the estimated IEs in previous step for each country, and also discusses the common trend extracted. The GeoCopula fitting results are showed in Subsection 4.5. The forecasting results are presented in Subsection 4.6.

4.1 Data
We take monthly nominal and inflation-linked yield data of zero-coupon government bonds from Bloomberg and Datastream. The research databases are supported by the Research Data Center (RDC) from the Collaborative Research Center 649, Humboldt Universität zu Berlin. We consider data from the developed European countries - United Kingdom (U.K.), France, Germany, Italy and Sweden, which are all member states of European Union (EU). The motivation for us to select these countries are the availability of frequently traded inflation indexed bond data. It should be noted that two of the selected five European countries are outside the euro-zone - U.K. and Sweden, and thus with their own currencies therefore independent central banks and monetary policy. While the Swedish krona is somehow tied to EUR, the exchange rate EUR/GPB is more flexible. Treasury bonds data are obtained for each country considered. Namely, we collect the Gilts bonds for U.K., OATs for France, Bunds for Germany, BTPs for Italy and the index-linked bonds for Sweden. Moreover, the real Gilts bonds in UK is linked to UK Retail Prices Index (RPI); the real OATi bonds in France is linked to France consumer price index excluding tobacco (France CPI ex Tobacco); the real bonds - Bundei in Germany, and BT Pei in Italy are both linked to European Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices excluding tobacco (EU HICP ex Tobacco); the real SGBi bonds in Sweden linked to Sweden consumer price index (Sweden CPI). The inflation co-movement can be observed across the selected countries in subsection 4.4. This also motivates our analysis to extract a joint time-varying structure of country-specific IEs. The lack of short-maturity inflation-linked bonds of the sample countries indicates that inflation-linked yield at short-maturity tends to be less reliable. We therefore select three maturities for each country to ensure that enough observations are available. The sample period covers the subprime crisis in 2008 and European sovereign debt crisis in 2011. Monthly data is collected, and the sample period is sightly different for each country. The surfaces of the yield data are plotted in Figure 2. The blank areas in the Figure represents a small proportion of missing values. Summary statistics are shown in Table 1. The mean
16

level for nominal bonds are higher than the inflation indexed ones. While Germany has smallest standard deviations, UK can be seen with the largest level of standard deviations.

4.2 Yield Curve Modelling - Single Country
In this subsection, we fit the model in equation (6) and evaluate the model performance. Figure 3 shows the model residuals over different maturities for all five European countries.

The summary statistics of the model fit is presented in Table 2. The overall level of the the residuals is small (average absolute value at around 0.09), and also averaged RMSE is around 0.1, which indicates the goodness of fit for the country specific joint multiple yield curve model. However we still notice that the model residuals have small jumps for short periods. Specifically the outliers observed in Italy happened to be during sovereign default crisis in 2012. We can also observe larger residuals at around September 2008 for the U.K. and Sweden due to the well documented subprime crisis.

The filtered four country-specific state variables are plotted in Figure 4, with LiNt , SiNt , CiNt , LiRt. We observe that the level factors LiNt , LRit are significantly different, which justifies the factor choices in (6). To be more specific, although the slope and curvature factors can be combined for nominal and real bonds, the level factors needs to be treated as two different ones.
4.3 Decomposition of BEIR - Single Country
We have already obtained the model-implied BEIR in previous subsection. In this subsection, we conduct the decomposition of BEIR, into IE, the convexity effect and IRP for each country as in subsection 2.4. Figure 5 compares the IE estimates for each country with three-year and five-year maturity respectively. We observe a decrease of the expected inflation for the U.K., which is also seemingly present in the other countries. To illustrates the presence of a similar trend among five countries, we plot the country-specific three-year IE in Figure 6 (IE estimates with other maturities have similar patterns). We find out that our model-implied IE with three year maturity would track the realized inflation level closely. For instance, the realized inflation level of Sweden has two small peaks at around the third quarter of 2008 and 2011 respectively, which can be also observed by our IE estimates for Sweden.
4.4 Joint Model of IE - Multiple Countries
We use model in (18), (19) and (20) to extract a common trend of IE across countries, it also allows us to analyze the country specific deviation from the common trend. Recall that we have the joint model either with or without a default proxy factor, and we start by showing results without a default proxy. The extracted common IE factor is shown in Figure 7. Also, the estimated parameters for the joint model of IE dynamics are presented in the Table 3. We decompose the variation in the model-implied IEs into parts driven by the estimated

The variance decomposition is shown in the Table 4. The common effect explains roughly 30% of the total variation of each country. And it explains the least variation of U.K., which is due to the U.K. being outside the euro-zone and having its own currency. Even though Sweden is also outside the euro-zone, it has closer relationships with other European countries compared with the U.K.. The international interaction among countries can also be observed through the estimation results.

To analyze the goodness of fit of our joint IE model, the model residuals are reported in Figure 8. The small size of the model residuals show the overall good performance. However the model residuals are relatively larger at around 2012, due to the European sovereign debt crisis including Italy's default. To eradicate this, we also incorporate

Furthermore, we assess model fitting performance by showing the model residuals in Figure 10 and the estimation results listed in Table 6. The default proxy we adopt is the three-year Credit Default Swap (CDS) of Italy from Bloomberg, which is recognized as a important indicator of sovereign risk. We present in Figure 9 the extracted common inflation factor derived from the joint model of IE dynamics with default proxy.

The variations explained by the estimated common inflation factor t and the estimated default factor dt are reported in Table 6. The default factor explains the most variation in Italy and the least variation in Germany. This can be explained by the stability of German economy and therefore Germany is usually considered to be the benchmark in the European financial system.

4.5 Spatial-temporal Copula

In this subsection, we show results of a spatial temporal Copula model fitting for residuals

from the aforementioned models. Recall the spatial-temporal Copula model in subsection

3.2. Let the marginal distribution functions be estimated nonparametrically as empirical

distribution functions

T
F^i.(u) = (T + 1)-1 1{it  u},
t

and the marginal p.d.f.s are estimated as kernel densities estimators

(26)

T
f^i.(u) = T -1 Kh(it - u),
t

(27)

where Kh(·) are kernel density functions. For spatiotemporal covariance function, we have four parameters to estimate, namely, a, b, , . As for the parameter v (characterizing the behavior of the correlation function near the origin), we conduct a grid search method for a pre-estimation of the parameters, and the optimal  is estimated as  = 0.5, which means that the spatial correlation is an exponential function of u. As a is the scaling parameter of time, b is the spatial scaling parameter and  corresponds to the spatial temporal interaction. We have then the following interpretation for the estimated parameters: given ^ = 0.1958, a^ = 0.02277 means that the marginal temporal correlation decreases by around 2% with 1 month increase in time, and ^b = 0.00137 indicates that the marginal space correlation decays by around 1% with a 100-km increase in space. Moreover, we adopt a cross validation method for selecting the cutoff points d1, d2, and we have also observed that the estimated cutoff points correspond to the points where the fitted variogram shows the correlation starts to vanish.

The longitude and latitude of the capital cities are used to measure the geographical distance, see Table 7.

^ d=ef arg min(^(t1 - t2, n1 - n2) - ^(t1 - t2, n1 - n2))2.

(31)

The fitted empirical and parameterized variograms on the transformed data are shown in Figure 11 (transformed data are (F^-1(uit)), with (·) as the c.d.f. of a standard normal distribution). One axis represents the time lags, and another represents the spatial lags. We observe that the (vertical axis) is increasing in with both time lag and distance, which means a decrease in the variance-covariance matrix in time and in distance.
The one step ahead forecast for five countries are shown in Figure 12, where the blue solid line corresponds to the prediction of residuals coming from our Copula model. The forecast is later integrated to forecast IEs.

4.6 Forecast
In this section, we evaluate the forecast performance of our model 20. The averaged one step ahead forecast errors with and without Spatial-temporal Copula approach are shown in term of mean squared errors. The mean squared one month ahead forecast errors are listed in Table 8. The pre-sample period we select for measuring MSEs is from 06.2009 to 07.2013. The sample period used to calculate MSE is from 08.2013 to 07.2014, where we consider one step ahead forecast for IEs within this period with a moving window. We also conduct cross-sectional forecasts to examine the forecast accuracy, the results are shown in Table 9. We find out that our model with Spatial-temporal Copula model would have IE closer to the realized inflation level.

Figure 13 displays 30 month ahead forecast for the common trend factor (in blue), which is, a two and a half year forecast horizon. The confidence intervals are presented graphically and are shown at confidence levels of 80% and 95%. Figure 14 compares the forecasting behavior with and without the Spatial-temporal Copula approach. The approach with Spatial-temporal Copula is plotted as dotted line with the out-of-sample forecast marked

in blue. We can observe that the two forecast results follow a similar pattern. The forecast result displayed by Spatial-temporal Copula approach is more sensitive to the market with inflation expectation tends to zero, which successfully captures the decrease of inflation rate in euro area.

A similar co-movement exits between the realized inflation level and the three-year IE estimated derived from our model. The 1 year and 2 year SPF (Survey Professional Forecast) data plotted in Figure 15 vary slightly over time, and therefore contains limited information of financial markets.

5 Conclusion

This study provide a joint modeling approach of IE across countries. We firstly construct an AFNS model in multi-maturity term structure of modelling nominal and inflationindexed bonds simultaneously. Then we adopt the decomposition of model-implied BEIR into parts of IE, convexity effect and IRP to facilitate the modelling of joint structure of IE dynamics. A spatial-temporal Copula model is fitted to account for the non-Gaussian dependency among coutries. The joint models of IE dynamics with, and without macroeconomic factors indicate the extracted common inflation factor and was an important driver for each country of interest. Finally, our model provide informative forecast of IEs and provide good implications to monetary policies.

It first forms an optimal predictor of the unobserved state variable vector given its previously estimated value. This prediction is obtained using the distribution of unobserved state variables, conditional on the previous estimated values. These estimates for unobserved state variables are then updated using the information

provided by the observed variables. By rewriting the yield equation (6) of the joint AFNS model in multi-maturity term structure proposed in subsection 2.3, we obtain the measurement equation as,

The transition equation derived from Christensen et al. (2011) takes the form of,

Xi,t = I - expm -KP t P + expm (-Kpt) Xi,t-1 + t

(A.4)

where expm is a matrix exponential. The measurement and transition equations are assumed to have the error structure as,



  



t

 

0

Q0

 

  = N  ,





 



t

 

0

0H

 

where Q has a special structure,

t

Q=

e-KP s e-(KP ) sds

0

For estimation, the transition and measurement errors are assumed orthogonal to the initial state. The initial value of the filter is given by the unconditional mean and variance of the state variable Xt under the P measure,

X0 = P



0 =

e-KP s e-(KP ) sds

which can be calculated using the analytical solution provided in Fisher and Gilles (1996).

B BEIR Decomposition

In the environment of an AF model, there are no opportunities to make risk-free profits.

Based on the pricing equation from Cochrane (2005), the bond can be priced by the

equation,

Pt = Et {Mt+1xt+1} .

(B.1)

To estimate the expected value of inflation using the stochastic discount factor (SDF) Mt. Firstly we use the Taylor series to approximate the moments of the logarithm. Assuming that Mt, in a sense, significant from 0, so the yield for a nominal bond can be extended as follows,

log MtN+1MtN+2 · · · MtN+ = log µM + MtN+1MtN+2 · · · MtN+ - µM

(B.2)

where

µM d=ef Et MtN+1MtN+2 · · · MtN+ MN1: d=ef MtN+1MtN+2 · · · MtN+ .

Take a Taylor expansion of equation (B.3) and a conditional expectation Et on both sides,

Et M1N: = log µM - (2µ2M )-1Vart MN1: + Op(Var tMN1: ),

(B.3)

further as then we have

Var log M1N: = (µ2M )-1 Var M1N: + Op(Var tM1N: ),

(B.4)

Et log M1N: = log µM - 2-1Vart log MN1: + Op(Var tM1N: ).

(B.5)

(B.6)

Similar solution could be obtained for the inflation-indexed bonds by the same logic.

To facilitate the calculation of equation (12), the instantaneous risk-free rate rt and the risk premium t are given, more details can be found in Christensen et al. (2011) and Christensen et al. (2010),

rt = 0(t) + 1(t)Xt t = 0 + 1Xt

(B.7) (B.8)

where 0(t), 1(t), 0 and 1 are bounded, continuous functions. Xt is the state variable and Yt is the realized observations. The estimation of the inflation expectation can be calculated by

t( )

which are the solutions to a system of ordinary differential equations using the fourth-order Runge Kutta method.
