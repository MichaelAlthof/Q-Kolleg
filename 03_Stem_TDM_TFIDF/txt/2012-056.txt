Strategic Delegation Improves Cartel Stability
Martijn A. Han October 2, 2012
Abstract Fershtman and Judd (1987) and Sklivas (1987) show that strategic delegation reduces firm profits in the one-shot Cournot game. Allowing for infinitely repeated interaction, strategic delegation can increase firm profits as it improves cartel stability.
Keywords: strategic delegation, collusion, cartel stability JEL codes: D43, L13, L20, L41
1 Introduction
The strategic delegation literature shows how firms' profitability is reduced by delegating control to a manager being remunerated with a fraction of profit and sales (Fershtman and Judd, 1987; Sklivas, 1987--hereafter: FJS).1 This paper extends FJS's seminal model to an infinitely repeated setting, thus allowing firm owners as well as managers to collude. Strategic delegation can then increase firms' profitability through improving cartel stability.2
Figure 1 illustrates this result graphically. Denoting  as the standard Cournot profit and d as the Cournot profit in the delegation equilibrium, Figure 1a depicts FJS's finding that delegation reduces profits in the one-shot Cournot game, independent of discount factor

1This result holds for FJS's most elaborate case of Cournot competition. 2Relatedly, Lambertini and Trombetta (2002) extend Vickers' (1985) model--which can be rewritten in terms of FJS's model--and derive different results by implicitly assuming that firm owners do not react rationally on a managerial defection. Han (2011) comments on their analysis by considering rational players.

The intuition is two-fold. First, a manager defecting from collusion can be fiercely punished by the owners as they can stop delegating control (and potentially fire the manager); this reduces the managers' incentive to defect. Second, the possibility of delegating control to managers allows collusion between owners on the product market to be supported by reverting to FJS's unprofitable delegation equilibrium; an owner defecting from collusion faces punishment profit d < , which reduces the owners' incentive to defect.
The formal part of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the model and derives useful benchmarks. Section 3 characterizes the collusive delegation equilibrium (3.1), studies product market collusion by owners without delegation in equilibrium (3.2), and allows managers to be fired (3.3). Section 4 concludes.

2 The Infinitely Repeated Strategic Delegation Model

Consider FJS's delegation game as the stage game. Two homogenous firms i 2 {1, 2} produce at unit cost c 0 and compete in quantities, facing linear demand

p = a bQ,

b > 0, a > c,

(1)

where p is market price, Q = q1 + q2 is total output, and qi is output of firm i. Each firm i is owned by profit-maximizing owner i (female) who may delegate control to manager i (male)

2

by remunerating him with a fraction i of profit i, plus a fraction 1 i of sales Si, that is,

Mi = ii + (1 i) Si,
which can be rewritten as Mi = (p ic) qi by using (1). The managerial outside option is normalized to zero.3 The timing of the stage game is:
1. Both owners simultaneously decide whether to delegate or to keep control. 2. If owner i delegates, she sets incentives i simultaneously with her rival. 3. The players in control of the firms simultaneously set quantities on the market.

Repeated Interaction. The stage game is played in each period t 2 {1, ..., 1}, allowing for collusion on three dimensions: the delegation decision, incentives i, and quantities qi.
Owners and managers maximize their discounted stream of payoffs using discount factor own and man, respectively. To keep the analysis clean and to stay in line with the literature, collusion is on the monopoly quantity and punishment on the product market is characterized by reversion to the static Nash equilibrium forever. Everything is common knowledge and fully observable to all players. I focus on symmetric equilibria and denote i's rival by j.
Superscripts {, m, D} denote the Nash, collusive (monopoly), and deviating variables, respectively. Subscript d indicates that control of firm i is delegated to manager i. Collusion by player x 2 {owner i, manager i} is stable if and only if discount factor x satisfies

Benchmarks. Consider the following benchmarks, which are formally derived in Appendix A. In FJS's one-shot Cournot delegation game, owners are captured in a prisoner's dilemma and cannot avoid delegation, resulting in equilibrium incentives, quantities, and payoffs

3In their original framework, FJS consider rewards Ai + BiMi. Since the managerial outside option is normalized to zero, owners optimally set Ai = 0 and Bi arbitrarily small, say Bi = i > 0. With delegation, owner i then earns i iMi and manager i earns iMi. In the limit when i # 0, (i) term iMi has an infinitesimally small impact on owner i's payoff and, therefore, she essentially behaves so as to maximize profit i, whereas (ii) manager i's payoff only consists of iMi and, therefore, she maximizes Mi.

3 Delegation and Collusion

This section derives the collusive delegation equilibrium when managers cannot be fired (3.1), how the very possibility of delegation improves collusion on the product market between owners (3.2), and the collusive delegation equilibrium when managers can be fired (3.3).

3.1 The Collusive Delegation Equilibrium
The collusive delegation equilibrium yielding monopoly profits entails owners delegating control and colluding by giving no incentives for sales, thereby "selling the store" to managers who collude on the product market. Appendix B formally derives that

dmi

=

1, qdmi

=

a 4b

c , Mdmi

=

(a

c)2 8b

,

dmi

=

(a

c)2 8b

,

which is stable if and only if owners as well as managers have no incentive to defect.

(6)

Owner's defection. Owners can defect in two ways: they can (i) defect in stage 2 by

setting incentives different from dmi, or (ii) defect in stage 1 by not delegating at all. If owner i defects by setting different incentives, then managers optimally react with Nash

competition in stage 3 so as to punish the deviant owner. Conditional on owner i defecting

to incentives i,

Nash quantities in stage 3 are qi (i) =

a+(1 2i)c 3

and qj (i) =

a+(i 3

2)c ,

yielding





i (i) = a

which

is

maximized

at

i

=

a 4c

with

i

=

(a

c)2 8b

.

As

defection

profit

equals

collusive

profit,

while triggering future punishment, owners would never make such a defection.

If instead owner i defects by not delegating at all, this triggers Nash competition with

her rival's manager j in stage 3. Owner i and manager j respectively maximize i (qi, qj) =

(a

b (qi + qj)

c) qi and Mj (qi, qj) = (a

b (qi + qj)

c) qj,

resulting

in

profit

i

=

(a

c)2 9b

,

which is lower than the collusive profit. Therefore, owners do not defect from the delegation

decision. Lemma 1 summarizes.

yielding deviant quantity qi =

with payoff Mi

To optimally prevent such

a managerial defection, owners will want to avoid delegating control to managers in future

periods,thereby fiercely punishing the manager with a zero payoff.4 Using condition (2), i.e.,

Owner's commitment to avoid delegation. Whether owners are indeed able to punish

managers by avoiding delegation depends on the owners' patience own. Appendix D shows that the owners' commitment to not delegate suffers from FJS's prisoners dilemma when

owners compete on quantities while keeping control, but it is no concern when owners collude

on quantities while keeping control.

When owners punish a deviant manager by keeping control and colluding on quantities

themselves,

Lemma 3 After a manager defected, owners can commit to avoid delegation iff. o

.

As one can argue that discount factors are determined on financial markets, rational owners and managers with access to such markets can be assumed to be equally patient, i.e., own = man = . Combining Lemmas 1, 2, and 3, gives the following proposition.

4Appendix C checks that such punishment is indeed optimal, taking into account the owners' ability to commit to such punishment, and comparing the stability conditions with those in Lemmas 2 and 3.

and

Proposition

2

summarizes.

Proposition 2 In an infinitely repeated setting, FJS's static key result that delegation reduces firms' profitability does not hold for high discount factors, is reversed for intermediate discount factors, and survives for low discount factors.

3.2 Product Market Collusion by Owners Without Delegation

Owners may choose not to delegate at all and collude on the product market themselves. As

Lemma 3 indicates, owners can commit not to delegate and collude on quantities if and only

if

25 97

.

Hence, even without delegation in equilibrium, the very possibility

of delegation

improves the stability of collusion between owners.

3.3 Firing Managers

When managers can be fired, the collusive delegation equilibrium derived in (6) can be

supported by firing the deviant manager, while hiring a new manager who continues to

collude. Then, the owner's punishment strategy of no delegation becomes irrelevant and the

only relevant constraint is that managers do not defect from collusion, i.e.,

 d

1 9

by

Lemma

2. Hence, firing managers makes the collusive delegation equilibrium even more stable.

4 Conclusion
Strategic delegation improves cartel stability. The intuition is that managers face a zero payoff after defection as owners will punish them by not delegating control anymore. Owners can commit to such punishment for a large set of discount factors, because an owner's defection from this punishment strategy results in FJS's unprofitable one-shot delegation equilibrium.

Consider FJS's one-shot Cournot delegation game. In stage 3, both managers independently maximize Mi = (p ic) qi, leading to quantities as a function of incentives

.

(7)

In stage 2, both owners substitute these into i = (a b (qi + qj) c) qi to independently

maximize profit, yielding outcome (3), provided that both owners indeed delegate in stage 1.

If

owner i delegates, while owner j keeps control, then quantities as a function of incentives

i become qi (i, 1) and qj (1, i) by (7). In stage 2, owner i then maximizes i (i) =

(a

Since owner i is better off by delegating if her rival keeps control, while owner j is worse off if she keeps control and her rival delegates compared to when both owners delegate, owners indeed delegate in stage 1.

C Optimality of "Not Delegating Control" As the Punishment Strategy

This appendix shows that not delegating control is indeed the best strategy for owners to

punish a deviant manager. First, suppose owners instead punish by reverting to "delegation

and compete in setting incentives." We then get FJS's static delegation outcome (3) with

managerial

payoff

Mdi

=

4(a c)2 25b

,

which

is

actually

higher

than

managerial

payoff

in

the

collusive

delegation

equilibrium

Mdmi

=

(a

c)2 8b

,

thereby

making

collusion

fully

unstable.

Second, suppose owners punish by reverting to "delegation and collude in setting incen-

tives." In stage 3, managers set quantities as outlined in (7). In stage 2, owners substitute

these

into

their

joint

profit

function

P2
i=1

i,

which

is

maximized

with

incentives

i

=

yielding

i

(a c)2 8b

and

Mi

=

(a c)2 18b

Now suppose owners punish a deviant manager by ke8eping 2c5ontrol, while colluding on

Owner i then earns im

while

defection

Since

owners will not defect from punishment through delegation.
