Competition and regulation in a di¤erentiated good market
Ra¤aele Fioccoy
Abstract This paper addresses the issue of how to design the institutional structure of an industry which provides two di¤erentiated products. One good is supplied by a regulated monopoly and the other is produced in a competitive (unregulated) segment. Two possible institutional patterns are compared. Under "concentration" the regulated ...rm can enter the competitive segment by owning one ...rm which operates there (even though the two ...rms must be legally unbundled). The regime of "separation" implies that regulated activities are totally unbundled from the unregulated ones, that is, common ownership is not allowed. When the regulator does not know the regulated monopoly's cost of production, we ...nd that the pattern of separation improves (expected) social welfare as long as goods are substitutes. Conversely, concentration performs better in case of complementarity. Keywords: competition, complementarity, concentration, regulation, separation, substitutability.

1. Introduction
Nowadays competition and regulation often take place simultaneously in horizontally related markets, where goods may exhibit some degree of substitutability or complementarity. This is mainly a consequence of both important technological advancements and intense deregulation, which occur at a di¤erent pace in di¤erent sectors. Regulated ...rms are sometimes allowed to operate in competitive segments. Local telephone untertakings such as regional Bell companies in the US provide unregulated broadband internet services. The utility Pepco also o¤ers energy management services. In Europe GDF Suez, RWE and Enel all operate in regulated as well as unregulated markets in energy, water and other utility sectors. A further prominent example is Deutsche Post, which acts as a regulated monopoly in the distribution of all letters below a certain weight and competes as a logistic group integrated with DHL and Postbank in the liberalized market for the management and transportation of goods, information and payments. In most these cases legal unbundling is required, which implies that the regulated and competitive activities are run by separate ...rms with their own accounts but common ownership is allowed.
Regulatory institutions have raised some concerns about this horizontal expansion and have sometimes prevented regulated ...rms from exerting activities in competitive markets. This was for instance the case of the regional Bell companies, which had been prohibited from expanding into the unregulated long-distance services. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 removed this interdiction but it required these activities to be legally separated.1 However, these companies are still not permitted to manufacture equipment.
Whether to allow a regulated ...rm to enter a liberalized market and how to design regulation in this case are issues of practical and theoretical relevance. There are well-known objections to horizontal diversi...cation such as the fear that ...rm's expansion may distort competition in the unregulated sector (the "level playing ...eld" argument). Conversely, it is well established in the economic literature that ...rm's diversi...cation may yield e¢ ciency gains (economies of scope, also known as "synergies") which can bene...t consumers.
In this paper we introduce a di¤erent element which can play a role in the policy debate on horizontal diversi...cation: the di¤erentiation between regulated and unregulated goods. The aforementioned examples show that regulated ...rms tend to expand into related sectors, whose goods may exhibit a relation of substitutability or complementarity with the commodity sold in

the regulated market. To this end we consider a two di¤erentiated product industry where one good is regulated and the other is o¤ered in a competitive way. In the European utility sector, the former may be the electricity provided in the regulated market and the latter may represent the energy sold in the free market (substitute) or energy management services (complement). In a setting of regulatory optimal control, two possible institutional structures are compared: the regime of concentration, where the regulated monopoly is allowed to engage in the competitive segment by owning one ...rm which operates there, and that of separation, which prescribes that regulated and competitive activities must be totally unbundled. In line with some practical evidence, we assume that even in the ...rst case the regulator imposes a kind of unbundling and prescribes legal separation between the two entities, which must have their own accounts even though common ownership is permitted.
As Dana [1993] emphasizes, the problem of choosing the suitable organizational structure cannot be disentangled from the design of the optimal regulatory policy when the regulator has limited knowledge of the industry. This is because the organizational structure crucially a¤ects the informational costs of policy implementation. Hence, the investigation of this interaction allows the regulator to acquire a valuable instrument to improve the performance of regulation.
When the regulator cannot observe the regulated ...rm's cost of production, our model predicts that the pattern of separation improves (expected) social welfare in case of substitutability between goods. The idea is that the regime of consolidation exacerbates the monopoly's incentives to raise costs since this strategy is also pro...table in the competitive segment. Cost exaggeration has a positive informational externality on the unregulated af...liate which produces (and earns) more when goods are substitutes. This aggravates the regulator's critical control problem since the social costs of policy implementation increase. For su¢ ciently high levels of substitutability, the regulator must even abandon its desire to discriminate between the ...rm's types and can only o¤er a bunching mechanism. Under separation the regulator ...nds it easier to incentivize the regulated ...rm, which does not internalize the e¤ect of its strategic behaviour on the competitive market.
Concentration performs better if goods are complements. The ...rm's strategy to inate costs, which is as usual bene...cial in the regulated segment, now penalizes the competitive subsidiary, whose quantity (and pro...t) decreases (in expected value). We ...nd that countervailing incentives emerge, which relax the regulator's problem since the monopoly's interest in cost manipulation is weaker. For su¢ ciently high levels of complementarity, the regulator is even able to extract all informational rents despite the asymmetric
3

information problem. Our analysis suggests that demand interdependence between regulated
and unregulated markets deserves careful consideration from policy makers when deciding whether to allow a regulated ...rm to expand into competitive activities. Even though it is only a particular aspect of a number of important considerations which warrant a close study in any complete analysis of the topic, we believe that this element yields an additional relevant trade-o¤ which is worth per se investigating.
2. Related literature
The main part of the early literature on horizontal diversi...cation of regulated ...rms (see, among others, Braeutigam and Panzar [1989]) emphasizes the risk of excessive expansion into unregulated markets if ...rms are able to engage in cost shifting, which occurs when the regulator counts as costs for regulated services those arising solely from unregulated activities. However, Anton and Gertler [1988] demonstrate that regulators can use the pro...t opportunities created by "external" (unregulated) markets to insulate the "internal" (regulated) markets from quantity distortions which arise in environments with asymmetric information. A necessary condition for insulation is that marginal costs vary with output levels, thus providing a cost linkage between the two markets.
Lewis and Sappington [1989a] study a model where the costs of regulated activities are positively correlated with pro...tability in the unregulated sector. They show that the ...rm's incentive to exaggerate costs in the regulated market will be mitigated because such an overstatement implies a claim that participation in the unregulated market is more pro...table than it really is. Put di¤erently, allowing the regulator to expand into the competitive segment generates "countervailing incentives" (Lewis and Sappington [1989b]) which alleviate the regulatory task of controlling cost exaggeration. They depend on the black-box description of pro...tability in the competitive market. We also ...nd that countervailing incentives may operate when the regulated ...rm diversi...es but in our paper these forces are driven by demand interdependence between markets.
More recently, Sappington [2003] has shown that diversi...cation is undesirable if the regulator cannot control e¤ort diversion to unregulated services and the ...rm exaggerates costs. In Calzolari and Scarpa [2009] a regulated domestic ...rm also operates in an unregulated foreign market. Although ...rm's expansion ampli...es the distortions due to asymmetric information, home
4

consumers are better o¤ when costs exhibit economies of scale.2 The role of cost interdependence between regulated and unregulated mar-
kets has then been carefully studied in the literature. In this paper we focus our attention on a di¤erent aspect which proves to be of some relevance to the regulatory policy in case of horizontal expansion: the interdependence between markets on the demand side.
A handful of relevant papers analyzes the e¤ects of asymmetric information on the optimal organizational structure in a multiproduct industry with interdependent demands.3 Baron and Besanko [1992] investigate how a regulator should organize a production activity in which di¤erent units produce components (which are perfect complements) and each of them has private information about its costs. They show that contracting with a single ...rm which controls both components of production makes the regulator better o¤ than having one independent producer for each component. The idea is that the suppliers are disciplined by threatening to terminate their operation if total reported cost is too high. Termination reduces the pro...t that can be generated on both units. Integrated production allows the regulator to save rents because a single ...rm fully internalizes the impact that an overstatement of each unit's costs has on the output and the pro...t of the other. Gilbert and Riordan [1995] ...nd essentially the same results, by focusing on the case of inelastic demand.
Our paper asks the similar question of how to organize the institutional pattern in a multiproduct industry in a more general setting where goods are either substitutes or complements.4 This is in line with the analysis in Iossa [1999], who shows that a regulator which has imperfect information about the state of demand may achieve a better performance through integration of production if goods are substitutes, while decentralization tends to be preferred in case of complementarity. Notice that we ...nd completely reverse results in presence of regulatory limited knowledge about production costs. The kind of asymmetric information in hand clearly a¤ects the design of industry structure. Severinov [2003] shows that under complementarity or
2In a companion paper [2011] Calzolari and Scarpa consider a regulated ...rm which is active in other unregulated sectors of the same country, and joint conduct of activities generates economies of scope that are ...rm's private information. They show that even though this creates distortions in the optimal regulation, allowing the ...rm to integrate is (socially) desirable.
3For a review on this topic see Armstrong and Sappington [2007]. 4Gilbert and Riordan recognize that perfect complementarity is a quite special case when they point out that <<our analysis also depends on the assumption of a ...xedproportions production technology for the ...nal good. This is perhaps questionable even in the electricity example, because optimizing the transmission grid may reduce the need for new generation capacity>> [1995, p. 252].

small degree of substitutability the value for the producers of using two pieces of information together is lower than the sum of values of each piece of information used independently. Since the interests of producers are opposite to those of the regulator, the latter prefers centralization. The reverse occurs for su¢ ciently high levels of substitutability.
All papers mentioned so far presume that markets are totally regulated. As Iossa points out [1999, p. 213]
<<However, regulated ...rms often interact with unregulated rivals and this interaction plays a crucial role in the contractual relationship between the regulator and the regulated ...rm. Consequently a next step could be to consider situations where regulated and unregulated ...rms compete>> .
To our knowledge, no model examining the design of institutional pattern in a di¤erentiated good market takes this aspect into account. Our aim is to seek to ...ll this gap and consider a setup where only a part of the industry is regulated, while competition in the market occurs in the other part. We believe that this better ...ts the features of modern integrated markets, where regulated activities often interact with the competitive supply of di¤erentiated products. Within this setting we compare two institutional patterns: the regime of consolidation, where the regulated ...rm can enter the competitive segment by owning one enterprise which operates there, and that of separation, where there is full unbundling between regulated and competitive activities.
Our contribution is also related to the literature on the institutional design in vertically related markets (see Vickers [1995]). In line with some empirical evidence, this literature has recently considered the presence of legal unbundling. Sibley and Weisman [1998] and Cremer et al. [2006] have introduced the idea that the subsidiary independently maximizes its own pro...ts, while the parent company cares about joint pro...ts. Very recently, Hö- er and Kranz [2011] have suggested that legal unbundling can be a "golden mean" between ownership separation and full vertical integration. We follow the common approach in these papers, which presume that legal unbundling works perfectly in separating the interests of the a¢ liate from the rest of the integrated group.5
5As Hö- er and Kranz [2011, p. 579] recognize, this does not always reect the practice of legal unbundling. However, legislation in Europe and in the US often explicitly excludes direct instructions of the parent company or prescribes arm's length relations. Other requirements may help to implement more severely legal unbundling, like strict personnel separation which ensures that professional interests of the subsidiary's employees are separated from those of the parent company.

The rest of paper is organized as follows. Section 3 describes the basic structures of the model. In Section 4 we consider the case of regulation under complete information, where the two institutional structures turn out to be equivalent. Section 5 derives the regulatory outcome with asymmetric cost information. In Section 6 we make welfare comparisons between the two regimes. Finally, Section 7 is devoted to some concluding remarks. All relevant proofs are relegated in the Appendix.

3. The model
The setting under consideration is a di¤erentiated good market with two commodities, which can be either substitutes or complements. The production of one good is regulated. The other good is provided in a competitive way. Two institutional patterns are compared: the regime of consolidation, where the regulated monopoly owns one competitive ...rm, and that of separation, under which regulated and competitive activities are completely unbundled.
Following Singh and Vives [1984], the consumers'gross utility from the marketplace is represented by a quadratic utility function of the form

U (qr; qu) = qr + qu

1 2

qr2 + 2 qrqu + qu2 ,

(1)

where qr denotes the quantity for the regulated good and qu represents the quantity for the good provided in the unregulated (competitive) segment. Moreover, , are positive parameters, and j j < captures the degree of product di¤erentiation with 2 (0; ) if goods are substitutes and 2 ( ; 0) if they are complements. For = 0, the two markets are perfectly independent.
The consumer surplus net of expenditures on goods is given by

CS (qr; qu) = U (qr; qu) prqr puqu.

(2)

The inverse demand function pi (qi; qj) for good i, with i; j = r; u, i =6 j, is thus

pi (qi; qj) =

qi qj.

(3)

A benevolent regulator maximizes social welfare, which is de...ned as

7

W (qr; qu; Sr) = CS (qr; qu) Sr,

(4)

i.e. consumer surplus in (2) net of subsidies Sr received by the monopoly via the regulatory process (see below).6
Notice that (4) is a social welfare function à la Baron and Myerson [1982] with zero weights on pro...ts. The choice of this function is not crucial for the results we obtain. As Armstrong and Sappington [2007] emphasize, we can neglect without any loss of generality the shadow cost of public funds à la La¤ont and Tirole [1986] arising from distortionary taxation, which increases even more the weight of taxpayer welfare in the social welfare function and makes the analysis less transparent without a¤ecting qualitatively the results. Interestingly enough, our formulation also allows to interpret Sr as the ...xed payment of a two-part tari¤. Finally, a positive weight on pro...t in (4) would not change the relevant trade-o¤s, the only di¤erence being that the higher regulatory concern about pro...ts clearly creates lower quantity distortions and higher pro...ts.
The regulated ...rm's pro...t is

r (qr; qu; Sr; cr) = pr (qr; qu) qr crqr + Sr,

(5)

which is the revenue from the marketplace plus subsidies.7 Two ...rms operate in the competitive segment with respective pro...ts

where qu qu1 + qu2. The two ...rms compete on prices (à la Bertrand) and exhibit di¤erent costs. Without loss of generality ...rm 1 is more e¢ cient than ...rm 2, i.e. cu cu2 c1u > 0. As stressed in Section 1, competition in
6Notice that the regulator cares about welfare generated in the entire market, even though it is not allowed to control the competitive part. The idea is that the deregulation process may imply the loss of some regulatory instruments but does not a¤ect the regulatory concern about the aggregate welfare. This is particularly true if one indivisible market for di¤erentiated goods is involved.
7Possible ...xed costs which make the activity naturally monopolistic are irrelevant for our analysis and then ignored without any loss of generality.

markets connected with the regulated ones is often the result of a deregulation process. Hence, the competitive market can be thought of as a segment where a single ...rm still operates (...rm 1, see Section 4) but the removal of entry barriers and consequential deregulation allow a rival (or competitive fringe, ...rm 2) to exert (potential) competitive pressure.8 Interestingly enough, our results are not crucially driven by the assumption of strategic complementarity, that is, price competition. In the Appendix we show that the main conclusions remain valid if we consider strategic substitutability in the unregulated market, that is, quantity (Cournot) competition.
Under concentration the monopoly owns ...rm 1 and is entitled to receive its pro...ts. As discussed in Section 2, this implies that it cares about joint pro...ts, while the competitive subsidiary maximizes its own pro...ts.
Notice from (5), (6) and (7) that we do not consider economies of scope or any other cost linkage between markets. Put di¤erently, the two institutional patterns we investigate are equivalent in terms of productive e¢ ciency. In line with the main literature which is relevant for our purposes (see Iossa [1999]), this allows to focus on the role played by the interdependence of demands.
4. Complete information
To better appreciate how our main results are driven by asymmetric cost information we start with the case of a fully informed regulator. Under complete information the two institutional patterns yield exactly the same outcome: the regulated monopoly has no degree of freedom and then the (possibly) di¤erent strategic behaviours induced by the two organizational structures are inconsequential.
Our model is a two-stage game. After choosing the institutional pattern, at the ...rst stage the regulator makes a take-it-or-leave-it o¤er of a policy fqr; Srg to the regulated ...rm, which accepts or refuses the o¤er. In case of rejection, the ...rm obtains its reservation utility (normalized to zero). At the
8The more e¢ cient ...rm may be the former monopolist. There are good reasons for thinking that this is the case, like the longer experience of the incumbent in running the activity. For our purposes it is however su¢ cient that any one competing ...rm turns out to be more e¢ cient than the others, otherwise price competition implies zero pro...ts for any ...rm and the monopoly's expansion into the unregulated sector does not change its pro...ts (and incentives). Imperfect competition which allows room for pro...ts seems to be a natural assumption in markets which have been recently liberalized. The decision to deregulate is in line with empirical evidence (see Section 1) and it can stem from a number of sensible reasons (like the policy makers'desire to promote competition in segments which are not natural monopolies), whose analysis is outside the scope of this paper.

second stage, two ...rms compete in the unregulated market. We solve this game by backward induction. At the second stage, using (6)
and (7) Bertrand competition implies that the equilibrium price is (almost) equal to the marginal cost of (ine¢ cient) ...rm 2, i.e. pu = c2u,9 and (e¢ cient) ...rm 1 will serve all the market, i.e. qu1 = qu, with

Hereafter we denote by

the

pro...t of ...rm 1, which is the unique ...rm indeed operating in the unregulated

market.10

At the ...rst stage the regulator designs a policy fqr; Srg, which speci...es

the quantity qr and the subsidy Sr for the regulated ...rm in order to maximize

social welfare de...ned in (4). We replace the choice variable Sr in (5) with

r given their bijective correspondence in the monopoly's pro...t function for

a given qr. Using (5) and the second-stage outcome in (8), the regulator's

problem in (4) becomes

max qr
fqr; rg

qr2

1 2

cu2 qr 2 r s:t: r 0, (9)

where the constraint ensures the participation of the regulated ...rm, which receives a non-negative utility level from the regulatory relationship.11
Standard calculations lead to the following conclusion.

9There is a very minor technical detail here, since at the Bertrand-Nash equilibrium ...rm 2 charges a price equal to its marginal cost and ...rm 1 a price which is a shade ! below it. Of course ...rm 1 wants to choose ! as close as possible to zero, but for any given small number ! it is always possible to ...nd another number smaller than it. To solve this technical problem we use an escamotage which is common in the literature, by assuming that for identical prices all the demand goes to the ...rm with lower costs.
10We assume that, despite its cost advantage, ...rm 1 cannot set a monopoly price (see Appendix B). Otherwise, ...rm 2 would be completely irrelevant, and the e¤ect of (potential) competition in the market would disappear.
11 Under consolidation the original participation constraint is r + u 0. In line with some relevant literature (see Iossa [1999]), we restrict our attention to the ex ante case where the institutional pattern cannot be made dependent on the particular characteristics of the ...rm. This still allows the regulator to prohibit the ...rm from consolidating if it rejects the contract, so that its outside option is zero. Moreover, because of legal separation, each branch of the consolidated group must be viable per se when operating in the market (for instance because cross subsidization is not allowed), which implies r 0.

10

Lemma 1 Under complete information, the regimes of consolidation and separation yield the same outcome, which exhibits the following properties

qr =

cr z ( cu2 ) (1 z2)

(10 )

pr = cr

r =0 qu =

c2u z ( cr) (1 z2)

pu = c2u,

where z 2 ( 1; 1).

(11 ) (12 ) (13 ) (14 )

The quantities for the two goods in (10) and (13) are interdependent through the parameter z, which captures the relative degree of substitutability (z > 0) or complementarity (z < 0). Notice from (14) that the unregulated ...rm produces at a price above its marginal costs c1u, which arises from competition and cannot be directly a¤ected by regulation. The marginal cost pricing outcome in the regulated market (see (11)) reveals that the regulator ...nds it too costly to reduce allocative ine¢ ciency in the competitive segment by distorting the regulated price away from marginal cost. It prefers to tolerate this social cost and maximize allocative e¢ ciency in the regulated part of the industry while the monopoly is given zero pro...ts (see 12)).

5. The case of asymmetric information
The result of equivalence of the institutional structure emphasized in Lemma 1 breaks down as long as the regulator is no longer omniscient. We now assume that it does not know the cost cr of producing the regulated good.12
12Asymmetric information concerns only the regulated part of the industry. The competitive supply of a homogeneous good should allow the regulator to acquire quite easily all widespread information. More relevantly, our results do not change signi...cantly if costs in the two markets are unknown and independently distributed, when the consolidated ...rm does not know its a¢ liate's costs, as we expect with legal separation which usually prescribes a system of "Chinese walls" against the exchange of information within the group (the main di¤erence being that the ...rm takes the expected competitive pro...ts into account). As the choice of the institutional pattern does not a¤ect competition in the unregulated market, when costs are (su¢ ciently highly) correlated the regulator can achieve the complete information result under the two regimes by implementing a mechanism of "yardstick competition" which conditions the subsidy to the regulated ...rm on the outcome at the second stage.
11

For the sake of convenience, this cost can only take two possible values, that

is, cr 2 fcr ; cr+g, with (common knowledge) probabilities (0; 1) respectively, and cr cr+ cr > 0.
The sequence of events is the following.

and (1

)2

(I) The regulator chooses the institutional pattern.

(II) Nature draws a type cr 2 fcr ; cr+g for the ...rm and privately informs the ...rm.

(III) Invoking revelation principle (Myerson [1979]), the regulator makes

a take-it-or-leave-it o¤er fqr (bcr) ; Sr (bcr)g, which speci...es the quantity qr (:) and the subsidy Sr (:) as functions of the regulated ...rm's report bcr 2 fcr ; cr+g, such that bcr = cr in equilibrium. The ...rm accepts or refuses the o¤er. In
case of rejection, the ...rm obtains its reservation utility (normalized to zero).

(IV) Two ...rms compete in the unregulated segment.

Let us analyze now the regulatory game under the two alternative insti-

tutional patterns.

5.1. The regime of separation
The presence of asymmetric cost information allows the monopoly to exploit strategically its informative advantage. The economic literature has long ago emphasized that the ...rm has a natural incentive to overstate its costs in order to obtain a higher price and then a larger pro...t. This conclusion de...nitely applies to the pattern of separation.13
As the second-stage outcome is unchanged, the regulator's problem at the ...rst stage is the maximization of (9) in expected terms. Formally, we have

max f(qr(cr ); (r cr ));(qr(cr+); r(cr+))g

13 An e¢ cient ...rm which claims to be ine¢ cient, by declaring bcr = cr+ instead of cr , gets a positive pro...t, i.e. from (5) r (cr+; cr ) = r (c+r ) + crqr (c+r ) > 0, as r (cr+) = 0 if the regulator attempts to implement the complete information policy. Conversely, understating costs is self-defeating, since r (cr ; cr+) = r (cr ) crqr (cr ) < 0, as r (cr ) = 0.

where (16) and (17) are the participation constraints for the two types cr and cr+ of the ...rm, while (18) and (19) represent their respective incentive compatibility constraints. Clearly, each type of the ...rm must receive at least what it would get by mimicking the other.14

Standard forces operate here.15 The cr -...rm's production in (20) is ...rstbest optimal ("no distortion at the top" result), and the corresponding price in (21) equals marginal costs. Clearly, the competitive output in (23) is affected by asymmetric information, neither. The regulated quantity in (20) of the ine¢ cient ...rm is downward distorted - and the corresponding price in (21) is set above marginal costs - in order to curb the informational rent in (22) extracted by the e¢ cient ...rm. The competitive output in (23) reacts according to the sign of product di¤erentiation, and thus it increases (decreases) when goods are substitutes (complements) with respect to the complete information outcome.
5.2. The regime of consolidation
Under consolidation the regulated ...rm internalizes the pro...ts of its a¢ liate in the unregulated market. This might a¤ect the natural sign of incentives to manipulate information. The following Lemma guarantees that this is not the case.
Lemma 2 If the regulator implements the complete information policy despite the problem of asymmetric information, the regulated ...rm has only an incentive to exaggerate costs.
The regime of consolidation does not distort the usual direction of misreporting costs. The e¢ cient monopoly still pretends to be ine¢ cient. Conversely, the high-cost ...rm does not ...nd it convenient to understate its information.
However, the internalization of its subsidiary's pro...ts crucially a¤ects the strategic behaviour of the regulated ...rm. Incentive compatibility constraints are now written as

r cr + u cr

r cr+; cr + u cr+; cr

(24)

r cr+ + u cr+

r cr ; cr+ + u cr ; cr+ .

(25)

The regulator designs a policy which guarantees to the ...rm higher joint pro...ts from truth-telling. This means that the overall pro...t from revealing its own type (left-hand side of (24) and (25)) outweighs the gain from manipulating information (right-hand side of (24) and (25)).

15For an analysis of the impact of asymmetric information on the optimal regulatory policy in a single market, see the seminal paper of Baron and Myerson [1982].

Proposition 2 emphasizes that the regulator ...nds it optimal to o¤er a screening contract only if substitutability between goods is su¢ ciently low, i.e. z 2 [0; zs ]. Interestingly enough, the production of the e¢ cient ...rm in (29) is downward distorted, and the corresponding price in (30) is set above marginal costs. The c+r -...rm is also allowed to produce less than under complete information (the second addend in (29) is non-negative if z 2 [0; zs ]) and then the price is distorted above marginal costs (see (30)). More relevantly, this distortion is softer than under separation (compare (20) and (29) or equivalently (21) and (30)). The idea is that under consolidation the regulator reduces the wedge between quantities which ensures incentive compatibility (see (28)) in order to relax the relevant constraint in (26) and then curb informational rents in (31) extracted by the e¢ cient ...rm. The unregulated output in (32) increases due to substitutability between goods and then the competitive branch of the consolidated group is more pro...table.
If goods are su¢ ciently close substitutes, i.e. z 2 (zs ; 1), then the separating equilibrium characterized in the ...rst period of Proposition 2 is no longer implementable.17 The rationale is that the regulator's desire would be to have the ine¢ cient ...rm producing more than the e¢ cient one in order
17Notice that the interval (zs ; 1) where the bunching solution applies is nonempty for cr < cu, that is, when the spread between costs in the regulated segment is lower than the cost asymmetry in the competitive part of the market. For higher values of cr the regulator is always able to discriminate between the ...rm's types without violating the monotonicity condition.

16

to limit the high informational rents of the latter (see (26)). However, this strategy is not feasible because it violates the monotonicity condition in (28). The only option available to the regulator is then to implement the bunching mechanism described in the second period of Proposition 2. Both types of the ...rm produce the same quantity in (33) at a price equal to the cost of the ine¢ cient ...rm (see (34)). This allows to the cr -...rm to receive the informational rent given by (35), while the competitive a¢ liate of the consolidated group produces the quantity in (36).

5.2.2. Complements The following Proposition shows our results in case of complementarity.

Then, under asymmetric information, if z 2 [zc ; 0) the regulatory mechanism with consolidation exhibits the same features as if z 2 [0; zs ], i.e. it is de...ned by (29) through (32) in the ...rst period of Proposition 2.

If z 2 ( 1; zc ), the regime of consolidation yields

With weak complementarity, i.e. z 2 (zc ; 0), we ...nd from (29) an upward distortion of the quantity produced by the e¢ cient ...rm, while the output of the ine¢ cient one is still below the complete information level. The idea is that now the regulator prefers to increase the wedge between quantities, since this relaxes the incentive constraint in (26). Notice from (29) that the regulator induces an ex ante downward quantity distortion. Complementarity implies an analogous impact on the unregulated production (see (32)), which penalizes (in expected terms) the competitive a¢ liate.
The mechanism described by (29) through (32) is no longer feasible for su¢ ciently close complements, i.e. z 2 ( 1; zc ).18 This occurs because the e¢ cient ...rm would incur losses (the pro...t in (31) would be negative) and then would not participate. The cut-o¤ value zc de...ned by (37) denotes the highest level of complementarity which is compatible with positive pro...ts. When goods are close complements, the incentive constraint in (26) is so weak that the regulator can extract all informational rents (see (40)). This does not imply at all that the ...rm's interests perfectly align with those of the regulator and then the ...rst-best outcome can be achieved. Regulated quantities in (38) - and corresponding prices in (39) - are qualitatively distorted as before to ensure incentive compatibility ((26) is still binding at the optimum), and the competitive subsidiary provides the output in (41).
6. Welfare comparisons
We are now in a position to state our main results.
Proposition 4 Under asymmetric information, if goods are substitutes the regime of separation
(i) reduces expected informational rents (ii) increases expected consumer surplus (iii) increases expected social welfare. If goods are complements, the regime of concentration yields (i) through (iii). The two regimes give the same amount of expected subsidies to the regulated ...rm.
The ...rst period of Proposition 4 reveals that with substitutability the pattern of consolidation exacerbates the monopoly's incentives to exaggerate costs. This strategy is pro...table both in the regulated segment, where the
18 The interval ( 1; zc ) is nonempty, i.e. (z) < 0 in (37), if cu is high enough (see the Appendix for details).
18

...rm can gain from the usual mimicking behaviour, and in the unregulated part of the market, since substitutability between goods implies an increase in production (and pro...ts) of the competitive subsidiary. Put di¤erently, cost exaggeration yields a positive informational externality for the monopoly in the unregulated market. This makes the incentive constraint in (26) more severe than in (18). Taking the expected di¤erence between (31) and (22) yields

E

C r

E

S r

=

z

(1 + 2 ) cu

cr (1

cu ,

(42)

which is positive for z 2 [0; zs ]. This means that the regime of consolidation distributes higher (expected) informational rents. The more severe incentive problem under consolidation yields higher allocative ine¢ ciency, which reduces (expected) consumer surplus and social welfare. Separation clearly performs better, since the monopoly neglects the impact of its choices on the competitive segment, and this relaxes the regulator's incentive problem. For su¢ ciently high levels of substitutability, i.e. if z 2 (zs ; 1), the pattern of consolidation is even less appealing, since the regulator cannot discriminate between the ...rm's types.
The second part of Proposition 4 shows that complementarity inverts the sign of forces at work. The regime of consolidation now softens the regulator's critical control problem, since the internalization of the loss in the competitive segment arising from cost manipulation weakens the monopoly's incentive to exaggerate costs. In other terms, consolidation creates countervailing incentives which make the regulatory task of controlling cost exaggeration less burdensome. The sign of (42) is now negative, which means that for z 2 [zc ; 0) consolidation allows the regulator to reduce informational rents. This improves allocative e¢ ciency, by making consumers and society better o¤. With su¢ ciently high levels of complementarity, i.e. if z 2 ( 1; zc ), the regulatory policy with consolidation is even able to capture all informational rents of the ...rm.
Finally notice that the regulated monopoly receives the same (expected) subsidy irrespective of the regime. The two relevant constraints in (18) and (26) di¤er in a term which only depends on quantities, and then there is no reason for providing di¤erent subsidies.

7. Concluding remarks
This paper has examined the design of the institutional pattern in a twoproduct industry with interdependent demands where one good is subject to
19

regulation and the other is provided in a competitive way. We have found that the regime of separation improves (expected) social welfare when goods are substitutes. This is because the regulated ...rm does not internalize the gain from exaggerating costs in the competitive segment and then requires lower informational rents. The opposite occurs in case of complementarity, since a consolidated ...rm cares about the loss it imposes on the competitive a¢ liate when manipulating its cost information, and then the pattern of consolidation is less costly to implement.
We have also shown how the degree of product di¤erentiation crucially a¤ects the features of the optimal regulatory policy. If goods are su¢ ciently close substitutes, under consolidation the regulator can no longer discriminate between the ...rm's types and it is forced to o¤er a bunching mechanism. Conversely, for high levels of complementarity, the regulatory mechanism is able to extract all informational rents of the ...rm.
Our results may also shed some light on merger policies. While the welfare e¤ects of consolidations between ...rms in competitive industries are well known in the literature, this analysis in environments where regulated and competitive activities interact is a stimulating ...eld which needs further reasearch. The interplay between competition and regulation may yield new e¤ects of some interest.

Appendix
Proof of Proposition 1 Standard arguments imply that (17) and (18) are binding at the optimum. Replacing these constraints into (15) we get the following ...rst-order conditions

cr qr cr z

cu2 qr cr = 0

(1 )

cr+ qr cr+ z

cu2 qr cr+

cr = 0,

which yield (20). Straightforward substitutions allow to ...nd (21) through (23).

Proof of Lemma 2 The monopoly's extra pro...t (c+r ; cr ) from cost overstatement, that is, when claiming bcr = c+r instead of cr , amounts to

c+r ; cr = r cr+; cr + u c+r ; cr 20

r cr

u cr .

(43)

We ...nd from (5) that r (cr+; cr ) = r (cr+) + crqr (c+r ) = crqr (c+r ), since declaring the actual costs implies zero pro...ts when the complete information
policy is implemented (see (12)). Then, we can rewrite (43) as follows

c+r ; cr = crqr cr+

cu qu qr cr

qu qr cr+ ,

(44)

where the second addend arises from the second-stage Bertrand competition (see (8)). Substituting (10) and (13) into (44) yields

c+r ; cr =

cr+ z

cu2 +z cu =

cr+ z

2cu2 + cu1 . (45)

If z 0 then (45) is positive, since the term in square brackets is positive (qr > 0 in (10)). If z < 0 we ...nd again (cr+; cr ) > 0 for > c+r and
> 2cu2 c1u.19 Hence, the monopolist has an incentive to inate costs. Following the same procedure, the monopoly's extra pro...t (cr ; cr+)
from cost understatement, that is, when declaring bcr = cr instead of c+r , is

cr ; c+r = r cr ; c+r + u cr ; c+r

r cr+

Since from (5) r (cr ; cr+) = r (cr ) (10) and (13) into (46) yields

crqr (cr ) =

u cr+ .

(46)

crqr (cr ), replacing

cr ; cr+ =

cr z

c2u z cu

=

cr + z

2c2u + c1u :

As the term in square brackets is positive, for z 0 we have (cr ; cr+) < 0. Notice from the second equality that the same conclusion applies if z < 0,
since (cr ; cr+) is the sum of two negative terms. This means that deating costs is not pro...table.

19If ...rm 2's costs were large enough relative to ...rm 1's, then the latter could impose the

monopoly

price,

i.e.

pmu

=

1 2

+ c1u

qr . However, this clashes with the assumption of

competition, since ...rm 2 would be completely irrelevant. Hence, we rule out the case of

monopoly pricing and assume pum > cu2 irrespective of the di¤erentiation between goods, which implies > 2cu2 c1u.

21

where the last two inequalities ( 2 (0; 1)) imply that either (16) or (26) (or both) and either (17) or (27) (or both) must be binding at the optimum (by complementary slackness conditions). Notice that under substitutability one participation constraint is binding in equilibrium. If no participation constraint were binding, the regulator could increase social welfare by reducing r (cr ) and r (c+r ) by the same amount until one of them saturates, a contradiction.20 If both of them were binding, then (26) would be violated.21
This discussion implies that we can restrict our attention on the following four cases
(I) > 0; = 0; " > 0; > 0 (II) > 0; = 0; " = 0; > 0 (III) = 0; > 0; " > 0; = 0 (IV) = 0; > 0; " > 0; > 0. We can immediately see that case I is impossible. In fact, "; > 0 yields from (26) and (27) qr (cr ) = qr (cr+), which in turn implies r (cr ) > 0 from (26), a contradiction with > 0. Case II cannot be a solution either, since the binding (16) combined with (27) yields r (c+r ) < 0, which violates (17). Hence, the regulator ...nds it optimal to implement the separating mechanism which emerges in case III. This is shown in the ...rst period of Proposition 2 in the paper. To ...nd this result, optimize (15) subject to the binding constraints (17) and (26). The ...rst-order conditions are

cr qr cr z

cu2 qr cr

z cu = 0

(1 )

cr+ qr cr+ z

c2u qr cr+

( cr z cu) = 0,

which immediately yield (29). Standard substitutions allow to derive (30)

through (32).

Notice that this solution is feasible as long as the monotonicity condition

in (28) is satis...ed, i.e. if z 2 [0; zs ], where zs

Otherwise, case IV

applies, which yields the bunching outcome illustrated in the second period of

Proposition 2.22 To derive this solution, optimize (15) subject to the binding

constraints (17) and (28). The ...rst-order condition is

cr qr z

c2u qr

cr

20Summing (50) and (51) yields + = 1, which implies that at least one of the
corresponding constraints must be stringent. 21We will see that this may be no longer the case under complementarity. 22The solution in case III (when feasible) clearly dominates that in case IV, since in the
latter the additional constraint in (27) is relevant.

23

+ (1 )

cr+ qr z

cu2 qr = 0,

which yields (33). Standard substitutions imply (34) through (36).

Proof of Proposition 3 Under complementarity, we may ...nd both

(16) and (17) to be binding. This implies that there are three other possible

cases to investigate:

(V) > 0; > 0; " > 0; > 0

(VI) > 0; > 0; " = 0; > 0

(VII) > 0; > 0; " > 0; = 0.

It is immediate to see that case V (which implies all constraints bind-

ing) is impossible because (26) and (27) yield qr (cr ) = qr (c+r ), which in turn implies r (cr ) > 0 using (17) and (26), and this contradicts > 0. Case VI can also be ruled out, since the binding (16), (17) and (27) yield

qr (c+r ) =

cr +z z cu

cu qr

(cr

),

which

implies

qr

qr

(cr

),

a

violation

of

the

monotonicity condition in (28). Let us consider now case VII. Notice that

this solution is implementable since the binding (16), (17) and (26) imply

qr (c+r ) =

z cu crz cu

qr

(cr

),

i.e.

qr (c+r )

<

qr (cr

),

which

satis...es

(28)

and

then

ensures that (27) is ful...lled.

Notice that the aforementioned case I is impossible even under comple-

mentarity. We consider now case II with z < 0. Using (51), (48) and (49)

can be rewritten as

qr cr =

cr z ( (1 z2)

c2u) +

1 cr + z cu (1 z2)

(52)

qr cr+ =

cr+ z ( cu2 ) (1 z2)

z (1

cu z2

)

,

(53)

where 1 = 1 . Substituting (52) and (53) into the binding (27) yields after some manipulations

r c+r =

cr z (

cu2 ) + 1 ( (1 z2)

cr + z

cu)

cr

1+ z cu

1 ( cr + z cu) : (1 z2)

24

(54)

We claim that (54) is negative, which violates the c+r -...rm's participation constraint in (17) and then case II cannot be a solution. To see this, ...rst

notice from (52) and (53) that the monotonicity condition in (28) implies

cr z cu. Then, su¢ cient condition for (54) to be negative is that the ...rst ratio is greater than the second ratio. This is the case since qr (cr+) > 0 in (53).

Hence, we are left with cases III, IV and VII. The separating equilibrium

in case III is implementable as long

C r

(cr

)

0 in (31), i.e.

(z)

0 in

(37).23 As

(0) > 0 (qrC (c+r ) > 0) and

00 (z) =

2(1+ ) cr

c2u

<

0,

then

for

z < 0 there exists a unique value zc such that 0 if and only if z 2 [zc ; 0).

For z 2 (

1; zc ), then

C r

(cr

)

<

0

and

the

solution

in

case

III

is

no longer feasible, as emphasized in Proposition 3 in the paper.

We claim that if case III is not feasible the regulator ...nds it optimal to

implement case VII. Replacing = 0 in (48) and (49) yields (38) in Proposi-

tion 3. From (26) we ...nd after some manipulations the value for " 2 (0; )

(see 50)). The expressions (39) through (41) are derived from straightforward

substitutions.

To show that case VII outperforms case IV, we ...rst rewrite (15) as

(66)

As z 2 [0; zs ], the term in square brackets in (66) is negative, which implies E [CS] < 0, that is, the regime of separation increases expected consumer
surplus.
Using (5) we derive the expected subsidy di¤erence E [Sr] = E [ r] E [(pr cr) qr] between consolidation and separation. After some computations we ...nd

Expression (67) indicates that the two regimes give the monopoly the same
expected subsidy. As from (4) E [W ] = E [CS] E [Sr], then (66) and (67) immediately imply that if z 2 [0; zs ] then E [W ] < 0, i.e. expected social welfare is higher under separation.
Consider now z 2 (zs ; 1). From (20) and (33) we ...nd

(68)

which means that separation improves expected consumer surplus. From (20), (21), (33) and (34) the expected subsidy di¤erence E [Sr] =

which indicates that expected subsidy does not change between the two regimes. As from (4) E [W ] = E [CS] E [Sr], then (68) and (69) immediately imply that E [W ] < 0, that is, expected social welfare is higher under separation even for z 2 (zs ; 1).

Proof of Proposition 4 (complementarity) Notice from (66) and (67) that E [W ] > 0 for z < 0. Then, as long as the solution characterized by (29) through (32) is feasible under complementarity, which occurs for z 2 [zc ; 0), the regime of consolidation gives higher expected social welfare.
Consider now z 2 ( 1; zc ). Substituting (20) and (38) into (64) yields

(73)

since the ...rst ratio is positive (qrS (cr+) > 0 in (20)) and the di¤erence between the other two is also positive as " 2 (0; ). Hence, the regime of consolidation improves expected consumer surplus.
Using (20), (21), (22), (38), (39) and (40), the expected subsidy di¤erence

using the value for ". The two regimes give the same expected subsidy. As from (4) E [W ] = E [CS] E [Sr], then (73) and (75) immediately imply that E [W ] > 0, that is, expected social welfare is higher under consolidation.

Quantity competition The type of competition in hand clearly does not a¤ect the result of equivalence under complete information. Hence, we focus our attention on the asymmetric information case. Using (6) and (7) the second-stage quantity competition between ...rms 1 and 2 implies after standard computations24
24We assume that the cost di¤erence is such that ...rm 2 ...nds it pro...table to produce. Our results do not change qualitatively if ...rm 2 is so ine¢ cient that it prefers to stay out of the market.

where 2 ( cu1 + cu) qr (c+r ) qr (cr ) > 0 (as qu1 (qr) > 0 in (75)). Summing (79) and (80) yields the following monotonicity condition

qr cr

qr cr+ ,

(81)

which is equal to (28). As the regulatory maximization program under the two regimes only dif-
fers in the incentive compatibility constraints, using (81) it can be easily seen that (79) is more severe (relaxed) than (18) under substitutability (complementarity), which implies that separation (consolidation) performs better.25 This corroborates our main results in Proposition 4 of the paper.

25Notice that (80) (and possibly (81)) cannot be the only binding constraint(s) at the

optimum. If this were the case, r (c+r ) 0 would imply from (80) r (cr ) crqr (cr ) +

z 9

(qr (cr )

qr (cr+)). This condition is more severe than that arising when (79) is the only

relevant constraint (possibly with (81)) as r (cr+) = 0, by making the regulator worse o¤.

Hence, if (80) is relevant, then (79) also binds, which means that (81) is stringent.
