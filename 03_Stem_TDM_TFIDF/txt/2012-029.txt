Statistical Modelling of Temperature Risk

Abstract
Recently the topic of global warming has become very popular. The literature has concentrated its attention on the evidence of such eect, either by detecting regime shifts or change points in time series. The majority of these methods are designed to nd shifts in mean, but only few can do this for the variance. In this paper we attempt to investigate the statistical evidence of global warming by identifying shifts in seasonal mean of daily average temperatures over time and in seasonal variance of temperature residuals. We present a time series approach for modelling temperature dynamics. A seasonal mean Lasso-type technique based with a multiplicative structure of Fourier and GARCH terms in volatility is proposed. The model describes well the stylised facts of temperature: seasonality, intertemporal correlations and the heteroscedastic behaviour of residuals. The application to European temperature data indicates that the multiplicative model for the seasonal variance performs better in terms of out of sample forecast than other models proposed in the literature for modelling temperature dynamics. We study the dynamics of the seasonal variance by implementing quantile and expectile functions with condence corridor to detrended and deseasonalized residuals. We show that shifts in seasonal mean and variance vary from location to location, indicating that all sources of trends other than mean and variance would rise trends over spatial scales. The local eects of temperature risk support the existence of global warming.

1 Introduction
Recently the topic of global warming has become very popular. The importance of this statement relies on the fact that as temperatures rise, the variability of climate will increase, leading to an increase in temperature extremes, which will translate into signicant economic losses.

Part of the literature has concentrated its attention on the economic impact of global warming. Evidence concerning this issue has been emphasized in the works of Mendelsohn et al. (2000), Nordhaus and J. G. Boyer (2000), Horowitz (2001) and Nordhaus (2006) examining the output losses by sector once temperature increases by at least 2.5 or 3.0 degree Celsius. Other part of the literature, where we situate this paper, has concentrated its attention on the evidence of such eect, either by detecting regime shifts or change points in weather time series. See for example Alexander et al. (2006), who present trend analyses for the temperature indices followed by precipitation indices. The majority of these methods are designed to nd shifts in mean, but only few can do this for the variance. See for instance the works of Smith and Sardeshmukh (2000), Beniston and Goyette (2007) or Michaels et al. (1998). Another drawback of these methods is that the estimation results rely on the time range of data.
The causes of trends in temperatures are believed to include natural causes or human impact (urbanisation and an increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere), as well as other factors such as long term variability, the frequency of hazards or extreme events and the solar cycle. Moreover, IPCC (2007) points out that global warming can increase the intensity and frequency of extrem events.
Motivated with the recent ndings of IPCC and considering that changes in variance might have greater impact than mean eects, we focus on gradual temperature changes and attempt to nd evidence of shifts in seasonal variance of temperature residuals over time. Our reason for studying temperature shifts is simply to better understand the characteristics of observed trends and conrm whether global warming is changing predictability of weather. The majority of weather forecasting literature has based its results of evidence of global warming on structural atmospheric models, IPCC (2007). For such complex systems, an alternative modeling path is given by data-driven (statistical) techniques where the evolution of the system is studied by recording time series. Statistical models like in Campbell and Diebold (2005) have succeeded in the development of nonstructural modelling and forecasting of times series trend. Besides density forecast does not necessary require a structural model, but it does require accurate approximations to stochastic dynamics.
Due to the local nature of weather, we follow a time series approach for modelling and forecasting temperature. Our contribution is twofold. First, we present a seasonal mean Lasso-type technique based with a multiplicative structure of Fourier and GARCH terms in volatility. This stochastic model for daily average temperatures identies well the stylised facts of temperature (seasonality, intertemporal correlations and a variance describing the heteroscedastic residuals) and it captures weather extremes caused by long term climate variability, leading to normal residuals. Second, with help of novel statistical tools, we attempt to nd statistical evidence of global warming by detecting upward trends in the seasonal mean of daily average temperatures and in the seasonal variance of temperature residuals over time. We implement quantiles and condence corridor for expectile functions to the heteroscedastic residuals to show shifts in seasonal variation. The advantage of using such approaches is that are pasimounious and simple, exible, inexpensive and it is purely data-driven. The quantication of temperature risk is of particular importance for hedgers and traders of weather risk because of the impact of tail events on market prices.
The application to temperature data of the industrial Blue Banana European area in-

dicates that the proposed model provides a better out of sample t over other models proposed in the literature of modelling temperature dynamics which is of important relevance for the pricing of weather derivatives. The obtained results reveal shifts in seasonal mean and seasonal variation of daily average temperatures, which vary from location to location, indicating that all sources of trends other than mean and variance would rise trends over spatial scales. We conclude that the local eects of temperature risk (local global warming) support the existence of global warming.
This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 shows the tstochastic model for daily average temperature dynamics. Section 3 presents the methodology of quantile regression and expectile functions. The empirical analysis to real data and the performance of the multiplicative model over other models are done in Section 4. The quantile and expectile curves of the seasonal variation over the years are displayed in this section as well. Section 5 concludes the paper. All the computations were carried out in R and Matlab. The temperature data was obtained from Bloomberg.

2 Temperature Model

There exist many ways to measure climate change. Since our interest is on the statistical analysis of global warming, the most representative variable for the climate variable will be some measurement of long temperature. For our purpose, we equate global warming with a change in average temperature. Inspired by the work on nonstructural modelling and forecasting of times series and due to the local nature of weather, we follow a stochastic model for daily average temperature.
In order to estimate the evolution of temperature in time, the following discrete model for temperature dynamics as in Benth et al. (2007) and Härdle and López-Cabrera (2011) is constructed:

Tt = Xt + t

(1)

· where Tt is the average temperature in day t, t = 1, ..., T . Tt is computed as Tt = .Tt,max +Tt,min
2
· t is the seasonal function which is nonparametric approximated with a series of basis functions and a Lasso penalty estimator (see Tibshirani (1996)):

T

arg min

Tt - (t) 2 +   1



i=1

(2)

where Tt is a vector of daily averages temperatures, (t) = (1(t), . . . , K(t)) , k : 1  k  K) is a vector of known basis functions and  is a penalty term which shrinks the unknown Fourier coecients  = (1, . . . , K) to zero.

· Xt is a p-order autoregressive process AR(p)

p
Xt+p = iXt+p-i + t, t = tt
i=1

(3)

3

where t is white noise and t is the smooth seasonal volatility. t is assumed to follow a seasonal pattern as well.

The proposed Lasso estimator in (2) captures the global trend in time with orthogonal Legendre polynomial basis:

1(t) = 1, 2(t) = t, 3(t) = 3t2 - 1

(4)

and periodic variations with Fourier series:

4(t) = sin(2t/p), 6(t) = sin(2t/(p/2)),

5(t) = cos(2t/p), ... 7(t) = cos(2t/(p/2)), ...

(5)

where p = 365 (seasonal eects) or p = 365 · 11 (large period eects). The period of 11 years indicates the 11-year solar activity cycle, according to meteorologists, see Racskoa et al. (1991) or Parton and Logan (1981). The number of basis functions K is usually region/climate specic. Other approaches to estimate (2) are given in Benth et al. (2007) model, who uses Fourier series, or in Benth et al. (2011), who considers Local Linear Regression (LLR) for the seasonal mean:

365
arg min {T¯t - es - fs(t - s)}2K e,f

t-s h

i=1

(6)

where T¯t is the mean over years of daily averages temperatures, h is the bandwidth, K(·) is a Kernel. The advantage of LLR estimator is that no global function is required for the model tting.

Before checking inter-temporal correlations with an autoregressive process AR(p), dened in (3), the process Xt has to be tested for stationarity. For that reason two tests are applied, Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test for a unit root and KPSS test for stationarity. If H0 of ADF test is rejected and the H0 of KPSS test cannot be rejected then Xt is a stationary process and can be modeled with an AR(p). The order p is suggested by plotting the Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) of Xt and conrmed by the Bayesian Information (BIC) Criterion see Hurvich and Tsai (1989).

Empirical work has shown that the process in (3) is a heteroscedastic process with periodic pattern. Therefore the empirical variance t2 is estimated as follows: divide the residuals into 365 groups, so that each group corresponds to each day over all year, then for each
group estimate the average of squared residuals and nally smooth the curve. A one step smoothing model for t2 has been proposed in Benth et al. (2007) as:

L
^t2,F T S = c1 +

2it 2it c2i cos 365 + c2i+1 sin 365

i=1

(7)

Since the optimal choice of L in (7) depends on the region/climate to be considered, Benth et al. (2011) proposed to smooth the data with a Local Linear Regression (LLR), ^t2,LLR estimator, thus reducing the number of parameters to be estimated:

365

^t2,LLR

=

arg

min a,b

^t2 - a(t) - b(t)(t - t0) 2 K

t - t0 h

i=1

(8)

4

where ^t2 is the average of squared residuals on each day over all years, h is a bandwidth and K(·) is a Kernel.

Alternatively, Campbell and Diebold (2005) consider an additive model of a truncated Fourier function and a GARCH process of the form:

L
^t2,F T SG = c1 +

2it 2it c2i cos 365 + c2i+1 sin 365

i=1

+ 1t2-1 + 1t2-1

(9)

Another approach is given in Härdle et al. (2011), who show that the GARCH eects in (9) are small and therefore propose a local adaptive modelling approach to nd at each point, an optimal smoothing parameter to locally estimate the volatility. In a recent paper, Benth and Saltyte Benth (2010) suggest a multiplicative model of Fourier and GARCH terms in volatility:

L
^t2,MF T SG = c1 +

2it 2it c2i cos 365 + c2i+1 sin 365

i=1

 12t-1 + 1t2-1 (10)

This multiplicative approach is motivated by the fact that variance is positive and GARCH

eects are still found as an exponentially decaying autocorrelation function of squared

3 Methodology

3.1 Local Quantile Regression

Shifts of seasonal variance of temperature residuals can be detected with the application of local quantile regression. We follow Härdle et al. (2011) proposal, of an adaptive local quantile regression algorithm. It was shown, that quantile curves are good indicators for nding shifts in variance of local temperature residuals.
The  th quantile curve is given by the following formula:

Yi = l(Xi) + t

(11)

with P ( t > 0) =  and l(x), the conditional quantile function FY-|1x( ) which can be approximated by a polynomial. Yi and Xi, with i = 1, . . . , n, are independent random
variables and   (0, 1). The adaptive part comes from the bandwidth selection.

3.2 Expectile Function

The seasonal variation from the tted temperature model of equation 3 can also be ana-

lyzed by expectile curves (EC). The  -conditional expectile v (x), 0 <  < 1, given x, is dened as

v(x) = arg min E { (y - )|X = x} , 

(12)

where  (u) = |1(u  0) -  |u2 is the loss function. Note that  (u) = |1(u  0) -  |u
leads to quantile regression framework. Guo and Härdle (2012) introduced the localized

5

nonlinear smoother vn(x) of the expectile regression curve and constructed condence corridor around the estimated expectile function of the conditional distribution of Y given x. The advantage of expectiles over quantiles is that they capture the extreme events reported in the data - the special behavior of non-average observations.
4 Empirical Analysis
In this section we present the results of the empirical analysis to real data, the model validation and the shifts of the seasonal variance of temperature residuals via condence corridor of expectile curves and quantiles.

4.1 Data

IPCC (2007) points out that global warming has been detecting in two periods: the pre1946 and the post-1976 period. We limit our study to the second period. The modeling of temperature dynamics is implemented on four cities of the so called "Blue Banana" European area: Amsterdam, London, Paris and Rome. We are interested on these cities since the "Blue Banana" area covers one of the highest concentrations of people, money and industry in the world and the aim of our analysis is to detect evidence of global warming, as shifts in mean and variance, in this specic indusrial territory of Europe.

The temperature data for each city contain daily average temperatures Tt, measured in

C and are dened as Tt =

.Tt,max +Tt,min
2

The observations are from January 1, 1973 to

October 10, 2009. There were 0.03% missing values in the data which were handled by

computing the mean of the time neighbouring observations. The leap years were removed

in order the estimation procedure to be more consistent. Figure 1 summarises the monthly

average temperatures and monthly temperature means of the available datasets. The data

for each city is splitted in two datasets. The rst data set consists of 13140 observations

from January 1, 1973 to December 31, 2008 (in-sample data) which is used for model

estimation. The second data set consists of 283 observations from January 1, 2009 to

October 10, 2009 (out-of-sample data) and is used for model validation.

4.2 Temperature Dynamics modelling
We now proceed with the proposed methodolgy. We rst correct the seasonality in mean. Figure 2 shows the LLR estimator in (6), which is tted to the data using the Epanechnikov Kernel and a bandwidth proposed by Bowman and Azzalini (1997). We note, that a clear evidence of an upward trend of the temperature time series is not visible with this estimator. We next t the seasonal Lasso type in (2), with basis functions given in (4) and (5). We observe in Figure 3 how the penalty term  shrinks the coecients 's of the basis functions (t) for the four European cities.
Therefore the resulted seasonal models for London (t,L), Rome (t,R), Paris (t,P ) and Amsterdam (t,A) consist of linear and quadratic terms (trend) and a seasonal part (mix-

The Lasso algorithm in (2) takes automatically, for every location, the basis functions that minimize the sum of squared errors. The parameters {k}Kk=1 of the proposed models are estimated with the non-linear least squares algorithm and are displayed in Table 1. The interpretation to each parameter is dened as follows. The estimated parameter 1 stands for the average of the temperature, which is higher for Rome as one would expect. The coecients 2 and 3 of linear and quadratic terms represent the global warming eect. Parameters 5, 7, 9 and 11 are the maximum displacements of the periodic terms

(cosine functions) while 1, 2, 5 and 7 are their shifts. Since most of the coecients are positive, one can claim that there is an evidence for global warming. Figure 4 also shows an upward trend of the temperature for all cities, particularly for Amsterdam.
Before we t the AR process to the deseasonalized residuals (Xt = Tt - t), we check whether the residuals are stationary with the ADF test and KPSS test. According to Table 1, both tests indicate that Xt is stationary. Since signicant inter-temporal correlations and partial autocorrelations were identied in residuals, AR(p) models with order p were tted according to the BIC, see Figure 5. The estimated coecients are also reported in Table 1 and are consistent with other studies in temperature data.
The ACF of squared residuals of the AR(p) process (Figure 7) present a clear seasonal pattern which motivates us to calibrate t2 from the models in (7), (8), (9) and (10). Figure 6 displays that the seasonal variation is higher in winter and autumn and lower during the summer for all cities. The resulted ACF of the squared residuals after removing volatility (Figure 8) reveal that the multiplicative model removes seasonal pattern as good as the other estimators. Table 2 reports the normality tests (Anderson-Darling (AD) and the Jarque-Bera (JB)) for the standardized residuals. We nd that, the multiplicative model with GARCH eects isolates gaussian factors, in particular for cities like London and Rome.

4.3 Model Validation

We generate one step ahead predictions from the 283 out of sample observations (January 1, 2009 to October 10, 2009) for the multiplicative model of Fourier and GARCH terms. The observed and predicted values are shown in Figure 10. The deviations between the circles and the discs correspond to the prediction errors (PE). The lines correspond to the 95% pointwise condence intervals. Table 3 shows clearly that the normality of PEs can not be rejected at 5% signicance level for all analyzed cities. The kurtosis and skewness of PEs are reported in Table 3. Since the PEs' skewness of London and Amsterdam is greater than 0 we conclude that the prediction values, derived by the tted model, are more often below the observed temperature. PEs' of Rome is negative therefore the forecasted temperatures are more often above the real observations. For Paris the skewness is close to 0. The kurtosis of the PEs' distributions is leptokurtic for all cities. Moreover, QQ-plots of Figure 11 suggest that the PEs are close to the normal distribution with Paris to satisfy the best approximation.

To test the out-of-sample forecast, we apply the the root mean squared prediction error (RMSE) given by:

RMSE =

We describe the accuracy of the one-day-ahead forecasts in Table 3. The results for Rome outperform the ones of London, Paris and Amsterdam. The prediction power of the tted model for the other cities is relatively similar. Additionally from Table 3 it is clear the RMSE and MAE have very small values. Therefore, we conclude that the multiplicative model gives us quite precise one day ahead predictions and it is a good model for forecasting.
Moreover, 95% and 80% predictions intervals (PI) were calculated from the model. Concerning the calculation of PI 283 random innovations were generated. Secondly, a series of values was built from the model. This iteration was repeated 1000 times, 1000 realisations of the model were simulated. The PI were then computed as a corresponding pointwise (for all 283 data points) empirical quantile. In the next step we once more simulated 1000 trajectories and investigated the robustness of constructed PI. Table 3 shows additionally the percentages of the simulated observations which lie outside the constructed PI.

4.4 Testing shifts of variance over time
In this section we attempt to nd the trends of the variances of residuals of daily average temperature over time. This is achieved with the help of ecpectile and quantile curves.
Since the empirical seasonal variance relies on the nature of the grouping resulted residuals of equation (3), we follow the methodology of Guo and Härdle (2012) and apply the expectiles (ECs) to the residuals for each 12 year period. In this case, we have X = 1, . . . , 365 denotes the day of the year and Y are the model residuals within each 12-year subsample.

The upper panels of Figures 12, 13, 14 and 15 depict the estimated 0.9-EC for the seasonal variance in London, Rome, Paris and Amsterdam for dierent periods: 1973 - 1984 (solid lines), 1985 - 1996 (dashed-dotted lines), 1997 - 2008 (dashed lines). For the sake of brevity the tted 5% - 95% condence corridor is displayed only for one expectile curve. We attribute 0.9-EC to extreme temperatures, squared model residuals, observed within the sample. Analogously, the lower panels of 12, 13, 14 and 15 display the 0.1-EC and denote the smallest squared residuals, the observations well explained by the model of equation 3. It is worth to notice here, that expectiles by denition (12) are robust for very high and very low  .
For each of the cities the ECs have similar spatial structure to seasonal variance curves in Figure 6: the variance is signicantly higher for the winter-fall period. The maximum variance occurs mostly in January, and the lowest variation is reported in July. The structure of tted expectiles show dierences across the cities.
The most interesting ndings coming from the tted expectiles are the dierences within each 12-year period. The extreme temperatures revealed by the 0.9-EC dier signicantly over each subsample. We report that for any of the ECs tted for the dierent periods, does not lay within the 5% - 95% condence corridor of the other EC. In general, except for London, the values of the ECs grow over time: the ECs for the period 1973-1985 (solid

line) lay below the curves of periods 1985 - 1996 (dashed-dotted lines) and 1997 - 2008 (dotted lines). The ECs of the period 1997 - 2008 are signicantly higher than others. These seasonal results are consistent with the ndings reported by the IPCC about global warming eect. The ndings hold for most of the studied cities, indicating that all sources of trends other than mean and variance would rise trends over spatial scales. This means that high temperature is increasing far more often. The exception of London might be explained by the extensive human activities and industries localized in London area within 1973 - 1985.
The study of the low, 0.01-ECs do not reveal signicant dierences within dierent periods. All of the tted ECs dier signicantly over each subsample. We report that the expectile lines tted for dierent periods are not located within the 5% - 95% condence corridors. Moreover there is no seasonal pattern and curves do not uctuate much within a year. The only exception is Rome, what might be attributed to the higher temperatures reported there, in comparison to Amsterdam, Paris and London.
The quantile regression, similarly to the expectiles, is applied to the daily squared residuals over each 12 year period after taking out seasonal and AR eects. Xi, with i = 1, . . . , n are the days of each year and Yi are the daily squared residuals within each 12-year period.

squared residuals (discs) for each 12 year subsample as well as for all 36 years for the cities of London, Rome, Paris and Amsterdam. The lower line corresponds to the 0.05 quantile curve, the middle one to the 0.5 quantile curve and the upper one to the 0.95 quantile curve. The 0.05 and 0.5 quantile curves are not varying signicantly in comparison to 0.95 quantile curves for all cities. Therefore, we focus our analysis on understanding the 0.95 quantiles which correspond to the greatest values of daily average squared residuals.
For London, Figure 16, we observe the very interesting phenomenon that although for the rst 24 years the variances in summer months are not volatile, for latest 12 years there is an upward tendency which reaches its highest peak at the end of august. For the second 12 years we observe increase of the variances for the winter months. For Rome, Figure 17, we have the same yearly scheme of the quantile curves for each 12 year subperiod. The variance is higher in the beginning of the fall until the end of winter and lower from march until the end of summer. The same conclusion is remarked for the latest 12 year period of Paris, Figure 18, while for the previous years the variances are more volatile. For Amsterdam, Figure 19 depicts lower quantile levels during the spring and summer period and higher for fall and winter.
Expectiles have the advantage of capturing weather extremes, as we see in the shape of the seasonal variance (V shape). Figures 16, 17, 18 and 19 depict as well how the quantiles change over the whole period from 1973 to 2008. It is shown that extreme events are punished in the 95% quantile.

5 Discussion and Conclusion
The present study shows a purely data-driven approach to the important problem of detecting global warming, thus avoiding principles of structural atmospheric models. Since changes in variance might have greater impact than mean eects we attempt to nd evidence of shifts in variance of residuals of daily average temperatures over the time.

We present a time series approach for modelling temperature dynamics. The application is on temperature data of the industrial Blue Banana European area. We study the eect of seasonal variance change by implementing quantile and expectile curves to detrended and deseasonalized temperature residuals. We found, for most of the cities, that 0.9 expectile curves grow over time. This means a tendency for an increasing hot weather. These results are consistent with the ndings reported by the IPCC about global warming eect. For the 0.01 expectile curve, the eects are not signicant dierences within dierent periods. The ndings hold for most of the studied cities, indicating that all sources of trends other than mean and variance would rise trends over spatial scales. shifts in variance vary from location to location. Finally, it is important to remark the importance of statistical tools for assessing changes in weather extrem events over time.
The results provide evidence that global warming exists in the local scale.
