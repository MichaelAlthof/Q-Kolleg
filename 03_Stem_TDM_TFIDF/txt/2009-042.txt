The Cost of Tractability and the Calvo Pricing Assumption

September 3, 2009
Abstract This paper demonstrates that tractability gained from the Calvo pricing assumption is costly in terms of aggregate dynamics. I derive a generalized New Keynesian Phillips curve featuring a generalized hazard function, non-zero steady state ination and real rigidity. Analytically, I ...nd that important dynamics in the NKPC are canceled out due to the restrictive Calvo assumption. I also present a general result, showing that, under certain conditions, this generalized Calvo pricing model generates the same aggregate dynamics as the generalized Taylor model with heterogeneous price durations. The richer dynamic structure introduced by the non-constant hazards is also quantitatively important to the ination dynamics. Incorporation of real rigidity and trend ination strengthen this e§ect even further. With reasonable parameter values, the model accounts for hump-shaped impulse responses of ination to the monetary shock, and the real e§ects of monetary shocks are 2-3 times higher than those in the Calvo model.

1 Introduction
The Calvo pricing assumption (Calvo, 1983) has become predominant in the world of applied monetary analysis under nominal rigidity. The main argument for using this approach, however, is solely based on its tractability. In recent years, detailed micro-level data sets have become available for researchers. Empirical work using these data sets1 generally reach the consensus that, instead of having economy-wide uniform price stickiness, the frequency of price adjustments di§ers substantially within the economy. In addition, the Calvo assumption also implies a constant hazard function of price setting, meaning that the probability of adjusting prices is independent of the length of the time since last adjustment. Unfortunately, constant hazard functions are also largely rejected by empirical evidence from the micro level data. Cecchetti (1986) used newsstand prices of magazines in the U.S. and Goette et al. (2005) apply Swiss restaurant prices. Both studies ...nd strong support for increasing hazard functions. By contrast, recent studies using more comprehensive micro data ...nd that hazard functions are ...rst downward sloping and then mostly at, interrupted periodically by spikes (See, e.g.: Campbell and Eden, 2005, Alvarez, 2007 and Nakamura and Steinsson, 2008).
Given this conict between theory and empirical evidence, it is important to understand to which extent the constant hazard function is innocuous for the ination dynamics and implications of monetary policy.
To tackle this question, I construct a generalized time-dependent pricing model and derive the New Keynesian Phillips curve (NKPC) featuring an arbitrary hazard function, non-zero steady state ination and real rigidity. The resulting NKPC includes components, such as lagged ination, future and lagged expectations of ination and real marginal costs. This version of the Phillips curve nests the Calvo case in the sense that, under a constant hazard function, e§ects of lagged ination exactly cancel those of lagged expectations, so that, as in the Calvo NKPC, only current real marginal cost and expected future ination remain in the expression. In the general case, however, both lagged ination and ination expectations should be presented in the dynamic structure of the Phillips curve. In light of this result, we learn that lagged ination and lagged expectations are not extrinsic to the forward-looking pricing model. They are missing in the Calvo setup, only because the restrictive pricing assumption has them canceled out.
Furthermore, I present a general result that, up to log linearization approximation, the generalized Calvo pricing model based on a exible hazard function implies the same aggregate dynamics as the general Taylor framework with heterogeneous price durations. In the literature, both frameworks have been commonly applied to study the e§ects of heterogeneous price stickiness on aggregate dynamics. Dixon and Kara (2005), for example, generalize the simple Taylor-wage-contract model to explicitly account for the presence of varying contract lengths, and Carvalho (2005) models heterogeneity in price stickiness by introducing continuous Calvo sticky price sectors. Both of these works ...nd that the presence of a small portion of highly rigid sectors leads to more persistent ination and larger real e§ects of monetary shocks. In this paper, I show that under a certain condition regarding the relationship between the distribution of price durations and the hazard function, these two frameworks imply the same aggregate dynamics. This result has an important empirical implication that the aggregate data can be

used to uniquely identify both hazard functions and the distribution of sticky prices from either of these two frameworks.
When simulating the complete general equilibrium model, I combine the generalized NKPC with a standard IS curve and an exogenous nominal money growth rule. The simulation results show that, even without real rigidity and trend ination, the increasing hazard function helps to increase both persistence of ination and output gap. When introducing some degree of real rigidity, the generalized NKPC gives rise to substantially di§erent ination dynamics, namely, the impulse response of ination to a nominal money growth shock becomes hump-shaped. Moreover, non-zero trend ination ampli...es this e§ect even further. The economic intuition behind these results is that, on the one hand, increasing hazard function postpones the timing of the price adjustment. On the other hand, strategic complementary makes earlier adjusting ...rms choose a small size for the adjustment, while the later adjusting ...rms make a larger price adjustment. In another words, the increasing-hazard pricing together with some degree of real rigidity not only a§ect the timing of the price adjustment, but also the average magnitude of ...rms' adjustments, leading to a hump-shaped response. Trend ination ampli...es this e§ect even further, because high trend ination causes relative prices to disperse quickly. Last but not least, when the real e§ects of monetary policy shocks are measured by the accumulative impulse responses of the real output gap, models with an increasing hazard function generate real e§ects of monetary policy which are 2-3 times larger than those in the corresponding Calvo model.
In the literature, some cases of this general hazard pricing model have been studied in di§erent contexts. Wolman (1999) presents preliminary results, showing that ination dynamics are sensitive to hazard functions under di§erent pricing rules. Mash (2003) constructed a general pricing model that nests both the Calvo and Taylor models, and showed that implications for optimal monetary policy based on those limiting cases are not robust to the change in the hazard function. Whelan (2007) and Sheedy (2007) focus on the relationship between the shape of hazard functions and ination persistence. The most closely related work is from Carvalho and Schwartzman (2008), who study the relationship between the heterogeneity of sticky prices (sticky information) and monetary non-neutrality. They ...nd that heterogeneity in price stickiness leads to roughly 3 times larger monetary non-neutrality.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: in section 2, I present the model with the generalized time-dependent pricing and derive the New Keynesian Phillips curve; section 3 shows analytical results regarding new insights gained from relaxing the constant hazard function underlying the Calvo assumption; in section 4, I simulate the complete DSGE model with some commonly used parameter values in the literature and then present the simulation results; section 5 contains some concluding remarks.

2 The Model
In this section, I present a DSGE model of sticky prices based on both nominal and real rigidities. The scheme of nominal rigidity in the model allows for a general shape of the hazard function. A hazard function of price setting is de...ned as the probabilities of price adjustment conditional on the spell of time elapsed since the price was last set. Real rigidity is introduced similarly as in Sbordone (2002), who incorporates upward-sloping marginal cost as a source of strategic complementarity.

2.1 Representative Household

The representative in...nitely-lived household deduces utilities from the composite consumption

good Ct, its labor supply and the real money holding Mtd=Pt, and it maximizes a discounted

sum of utilities of the form:

Here Ct denotes an index of the households`s consumption of each of the individual goods Ct(i) following a constant-elastisity-of-substitution aggregator (Dixit and Stiglitz, 1977).

Where Bt is an Arrow-Debreu security of one-period bond and Rt denotes the gross nominal

that each household owns an equal share of all ...rms. Finally this sequence ofh periodibudget

Finally, the demand of real money balance is determined by weighting between the bene...ts and

2.2 Firms in the Economy

In the economy, there is a continuum of monopolistic competitive ...rms, who use labor as the

single input to produce good i.

Yt(i) = ZtLt(i)1 a

where Zt denotes an aggregate productivity shock. Log deviations of the shock z^t follow an exogenous AR(1) process z^t = zz^t 1 + "z;t, where "z;t is white noises and z 2 [0; 1). Lt(i) is the demand of labor by ...rm i. Following equation (2), demand for intermediate goods is given
by:

2.2.1 Pricing Decisions under Real Rigidity

In Appendix (A), I derive the economy-wide optimal relative price, which is the ratio between the average optimal price chosen by the adjusting ...rms and aggregate price index. Note that even through the individual optimal prices are not the same due to the fact that marginal costs generally depend on the amount produced, we can still derive the aggregate optimal relative-price ratio at period t from the average marginal cost in the economy.

To show how real rigidity a§ects price setting in this model, I log-linearize the relative price

equation (10). De...ne x^t = logXt logX as the log deviation from the steady state, up to a log linearization approximation, one can show that the log deviation of the relative price is equal

to the log deviation of the economy-wide marginal cost, which in turn is a linear function of log

deviations of output gap and the technology shock.

Parameters and 1 have the economic interpretation as the measure of real rigidity. is the elasticity of relative prices to the change in real marginal cost, while 1 measures the sensitivity of real marginal cost to the change in the output gap. Following Woodford (2003), price-setting decisions are called strategic complementarity when 1 < 1. When we assume that the monetary authority controls the growth rate of the nominal aggregate demand d^t, then at equilibrium we have y^t = d^t p^t. In this case, price adjustments are "sticky"even under a exible price setting, because relative price reacts less than one-to-one to a monetary shock. On the other hand, price setting decisions can be dubbed strategic substitutes when 1 > 1, so that relative price reacts strongly to monetary policy shocks.
Now we can discuss how changes in the labor share a a§ect the magnitude of real rigidity of price setting in the model. When setting a equal to zero, creating a linear production technology, then = 1 and 1 = + . Under the standard calibration values in the RBC literature ( = 1 and = 0:5 ), the real rigidity parameter 1 is equal to 1:5 and price decisions are strategic substitutes. When the value of a rises, the real rigidity parameter becomes smaller, and price decisions turn into strategic complementarity.
In Figure (1), I plot values of and 1 against values of a, while setting = 1; = 0:5 and = 10. In this special case, the sensitivity of real marginal cost to the change in the output gap 1 is not a§ected by the labor share, while decreases fairly quickly as a becomes larger. This means that, given the parameter values, real rigidity is mainly driven by the sensitivity of
6

the relative price to changes in real marginal cost, and the degree of real rigidity is decreasing in a. Only with a modest value of the labor share (around 0:1), real rigidity drops below the strategic neutrality threshold.

2.2.2 Pricing Decisions under Nominal Rigidity
In this section, I introduce a general form of nominal rigidity, which is characterized by an arbitrary hazard function. Many well known price setting models in the literature can be shown to have the incorporation of a hazard function of one form or another. The hazard function in this price setting is de...ned as the probability of price adjustment conditional on the spell of time elapsed since the price was last set. I assume that monopolistic competitive ...rms cannot adjust their price whenever they want. Instead, opportunities for re-optimizing prices depend on the hazard function hj, where j denotes the time-since-last-adjustment and j 2 f0; Jg. J is the maximum number of periods in which a ...rm's price can be ...xed. To keep the model general, I do not parameterize the hazard function, so that the relative magnitudes of hazard rates are totally free. As a result, this model is able to nest a wide range of staggered pricing New Keynesian models.

Dynamics of the vintage distribution In the economy, ...rms'prices are heterogeneous with respect to the time since their last price adjustment. I call them price vintages, while the vintage label j indicates the age of each price group. Table (1) summarizes key notations concerning the dynamics of vintages.

Table 1: Notations of the dynamics of price-vintage-distribution.

Using the notation de...ned in Table (1), and also denoting the distribution of price durations

at the beginning of each period by t = f t(1); t(2) distribution of ...rms after price adjustments ( ~ t)

t(J)g, we can derive the ex post

8 < ~t(j) = :

PJ hj t(i) , when j = 0
i=1
j t(j) , when j = 1 J

(11)

Intuitively, those ...rms that reoptimize their prices in period t are labeled as `vintage 0', and the proportion of those ...rms is given by hazard rates from all vintages multiplied by their corresponding densities. The ...rm left in each vintage are the ...rms that do not adjust their

7

prices. When period t is over, this ex post distribution ~ t becomes the ex ante distribution for the new period t+1: All price vintages move to the next one, because all prices age by one period.
As long as the hazard rates lie between zero and one, dynamics of the vintage distribution can be viewed as a Markov process with an invariant distribution , obtained by solving t(j) = t+1(j) It yields the stationary vintage distribution (j) as follows:

j

(j) = i=0 i = Sj , for j = 0; 1

Jj

J

i j=0i=0

Sj
j=0

J

(12)

Let's assume the economy converges to this invariant distribution fairly quickly, so that

regardless of the initial vintage distribution, I only consider the economy with the invariant

distribution of price durations.

The Optimal Pricing under Nominal Rigidity In a given period when a ...rm is allowed to reoptimize its price, the optimal price chosen should reect the possibility that it will not be re-adjusted in the near future. Consequently, adjusting ...rms choose optimal prices that maximize the discounted sum of real pro...ts over the time horizon during which the new price is expected to be ...xed. The probability that the new price is ...xed is given by the survival function, Sj, de...ned in Table (1).
Here I setup the maximization problem of an average adjustor as follows:

JP1 max Et Sj Qt;t+j
Pt j=0

Ytd+jjt

Pt Pt+j

T Ct+j Pt+j

Where Et denotes the conditional expectation based on the information set in period t, and
Qt;t+j is the stochastic discount factor appropriate for discounting real pro...ts from t to t + j.
Note that here Pt is de...ned as the average optimal price chosen by the average adjusting ...rm. Therefore T Ct denotes the average total costs of producing output Ytd. The representative adjusting Firm maximizes pro...ts subject to demand for intermediate goods in period t + j given that the ...rm resets the price in period t, (Ytd+jjt).

Ytd+jjt =

Pt Pt+j

Yt+j ;

It yields the following ...rst order necessary condition for the optimal price:

Pt =

JP1 Sj Et[Qt;t+j Yt+j Pt+j1M Ct+j ]
j=0
1 JP1 Sj Et[Qt;t+j Yt+j Pt+j1]
j=0

(13)

M Ct denotes the average nominal marginal costs of adjusting ...rms. The optimal price is equal to the markup multiplied by a weighted sum of future marginal costs, where weights depend on the survival rates. In the Calvo case, where Sj = j, this equation reduces to the Calvo optimal pricing condition.

8

Finally, given the stationary distribution (j), aggregate price can be written as a distributed
sum of all vintage prices. I de...ne the vintage price which was set j periods ago as Pt j. Following the aggregate price index equation (3), the aggregate price is then obtained by:

Pt =

!1

JP1

(j)Pt

1 j

j=0

(14)

2.2.3 Non-zero-ination Steady State
If I assume that the gross growth rate of nominal money stock is g, then the steady state is characterized by constant real variables and a growing path of all nominal variables at the rate g. Because the aggregate price level increases with trend ination in the steady state, ...rms need to adjust their prices so that the relative prices are close to the optimal ratio speci...ed below. If we de...ne X as the steady state value of variable X, then the optimality condition (13) can be rewritten as:

pt = pt = Pt

PJ j S(j)Y Pt+j

j=0
1 PJ

mc = j S(j)Y Pt+j1

j=0
1 PJ jS(j)Y Pt

1g(

mc
1)j

j=0

(15)

As seen in Equation (15), the optimal relative price ratio is equal to the constant markup multiplied by the real marginal cost along with an extra term, which reects how fast trend ination erodes the relative prices in the economy. When the gross ination rate is equal to one, this term is also equal one. In this case, we have the standard static price setting equation. However, when trend ination is greater than one, it follows that the extra term is also greater than one, meaning that the adjusting ...rms want to `front-load'their price adjustments in order to hedge the risk that they may not adjust again in the near future. As a result, they adjust their prices more than those in the case of zero ination. The higher relative price, in turn, leads to lower steady state output and hence, induces an additional welfare loss caused by the steady state ination.

2.3 Derivation of the New Keynesian Phillips Curve
In this section, I derive the New Keynesian Phillips curve for this generalized model. To do that, I ...rst log-linearize equation (13) around the steady state with the trend ination ( ). This is motivated by King and Wolman (1996) and Ascari (2004), who show that trend ination plays an important role in both the long-run and the short-run dynamics.

The log-linearized optimal price equations are obtained by

2.3.1 New Keynesian Phillips Curve
To reveal implications of the general hazard function on the ination dynamics, I derive the generalized NKPC from equations (16) and (17). To keep the equation as simple as possible, I ...rst derive it without trend ination, i.e. g = 1. After some tedious algebra, I obtain the New Keynesian Phillips curve as follows2:

(18)

At the ...rst glance, this Phillips curve is quite di§erent from the one in the Calvo model. It involves not only lagged ination but also lagged expectations that were built into pricing decisions in the past. All coe¢ cients in the NKPC are derived from structural parameters which are either the hazard function parameters or the preference parameters. When J = 3, for example, then the NKPC is of the following form:

In this example, we see more clearly how current ination depends on marginal costs, lagged ination and a complex weighted sum of lagged expectations. All coe¢ cients are expressed in terms of hazard rates ( j = 1 hj) and a preference parameter :

2.3.2 The NKPC with Trend Ination (g)
When I derive the NKPC by log-linearizing pricing equations around a steady state with non-zero trend ination, it can be shown that the resulting Phillips curve has the exact same structure as the one without trend ination. However, trend ination a§ects the magnitude of all coe¢ cients in the NKPC. Again, using the example where J = 3, we obtain

In this case, trend ination (g) enters every coe¢ cient in the Phillips curve, and hence it has not only a signi...cant impact on the steady state, but a§ects the ination dynamics in a complex way as well. In general, 1 and 2 are decreasing in g, while 3 is increasing in g. So the changes in trend ination alter the relative importance between the forward-looking and backward-looking terms in the Phillips curve.

3 Analytical Results
In this section, I explore the generalized NKPC (18) analytically to show which new insights we can learn from relaxing the constant hazard function underlying the Calvo assumption.

3.1 Relationship between the Calvo and the Generalized NKPC
The ...rst question I want to address is why these lagged dynamic terms are absent in the Calvo NKPC? Are they new to the NKPC? The answer is No. Next, I use a proposition to illustrate this point.

Proposition 1 : When assuming the hazard function is constant over the in...nite horizon, the generalized NKPC (18) reduces to the standard Calvo NKPC and the following equation must also hold:

^t = Et (1 Proof : see Appendix (C).

In light of these results, we learn that the generalized NKPC nests the Calvo Phillips curve in the sense that, given the constant hazard function, the e§ects of lagged ination terms exactly cancel the e§ects of lagged expectations, leaving only current variables and forward-looking expectations on ination in the expression. Moreover, lagged ination and lagged expectations are not extrinsic to the time-dependent nominal rigidity model. They are missing in the Calvo setup only because the constant hazard assumption causes them to be canceled out. Therefore, the fully written NKPC of the Calvo model should be of the form:

3.2 The Generalized Calvo Model and the Generalized Taylor Model
In the literature, modelers of nominal rigidity frequently use two mechanisms≠the hazard function and the distribution of price durations≠ to characterize sticky prices or wages. One is following the idea of Calvo (1983), assuming that probabilities of nominal price adjustments are exogenously given, while the other modeling strategy has its origin from the staggered-contract model of Taylor (1980), who assumes some forms of the distribution over price durations. Depending on the purpose, the generalized Calvo model (GCM) tends to use a exible hazard function (See, e.g. Wolman, 1999), while the generalized Taylor model (GTM) usually applies a exible distribution of price durations (See, e.g. Jadresic, 1999). Here I present a general result, showing that, up to log linearization approximation, those two models generate the same aggregate dynamics under a certain regularity condition regarding the relationship between the distribution of price durations and the hazard function.
Proposition 2 : Up to log linearization approximation, the generalized Taylor model (GTM) and the generalized Calvo model (GCM) imply the same aggregate dynamics, when (J) the distribution of price durations in the GTM and hj the hazard function in the GCM correspond according to Equation (40).
Proof : see Appendix (D).
Here I prove that, given the same driving forces of ination in both models, the aggregate price in the GCM is equal to the aggregate price in the GTM, so that these two models should generate the same aggregate dynamics. In light of this result, models assuming an exogenous distribution of price durations implies an aggregate hazard function, and vice versa. This result is not only theoretically interesting, but also has important implications for empirical work that uses those frameworks to study price stickiness (See: e.g. Coenen et al., 2007). It implies that the aggregate data can be used to uniquely identify both hazard functions and the distribution from either of these two frameworks. In another words, both models should extract same information out of the data about the price stickiness. Therefore one can choose to work on one of those models and safely draw conclusions about both distribution and hazard functions.
4 Numerical Results
4.1 The General Equilibrium Model
In the numerical experiment, I study the behavior of ination dynamics in a general equilibrium setup. For this purpose, I close the model by adding a nominal money stock growth rule. The log-linearized equilibrium equations are summarized here:

The weights (W1; W2; W3; W4) in the NKPC are de...ned in the equation (18). m^ t is the real money balance, and gt denotes the growth rate of the nominal money stock, which consists of a constant g and a white-noise shock ut, representing the regular and irregular parts of the standing monetary policy.

4.2 Calibration

In the calibration, instead of referring to any microeconometric evidence on the hazard function, I parameterize the hazard function a parsimonious way. The reason is that, until now, there is not yet consensus on the shape of hazard functions in the empirical literature. As discussed in the introduction, it is evident that the shape of hazard functions is changing over time with the underlying economic conditions. Since the main purpose of the paper is to demonstrate the impact of varying hazard rates on the ination dynamics, I choose to calibrate it based on the statistical theory of duration analysis. In particular, the functional form I apply is the hazard function of the Weibull distribution, which has two parameters:

j1 h(j) =

(23)

is the scale parameter, which controls the average duration of the price adjustment, while is the shape parameter to determine the monotonic property of the hazard function. It enables the incorporation of a wide range of hazard functions by using various values for the shape parameter. In fact, any value of the shape parameter that is greater than one corresponds to an increasing hazard function, while values ranging between zero and one lead to a decreasing hazard function. By setting the shape parameter to one, we can retrieve the Poisson process from the Weibull distribution.
In this numerical experiment, I choose , such that it implies an average price duration of 3 quarters, which is largely consistent with the median price durations of 7 - 9 months documented by Nakamura and Steinsson (2008). The shape parameter is set in the interval between one and three, which covers a wide range of shapes of the hazard function3. As for
3 This range only covers increasing hazard functions because it makes the maximum number of price duration J well de...ned.

the rest of the structural parameters, I use some common values in the literature to facilitate comparison the results. In the calibration of the preference parameters, I assume = 0:9902, which implies a steady state real return on ...nancial assets of about four percent per annum. I also assume the intertemporal elasticity of substitution = 1, implying log utility of consumption. I choose the Frisch elasticity of the labor supply to equal 0:5, an estimate commonly found in microeconometric studies (See: e.g. Blundell and Macurdy). As for the technology parameters, I set labor's share to be either 0 or 0:36 to show the e§ect of real rigidity. The elasticity of substitution between intermediate goods = 10, which implies the desired markup over marginal cost should be about 11%. Finally, I set the standard deviation of the innovation to the nominal money growth rate to be 25 basic points per quarter. For the aggregate technology shock, I choose z = 0:95 and the standard deviation of 0.007, in line with commonly used values in the RBC literature, for example King and Rebelo (2000).
4.3 Simulation Results
To evaluate the quantitative implication for the aggregate dynamics, I apply the standard algorithm to solve for the log-linearized rational expectation model.
4.3.1 E§ects of Increasing Hazard Functions
In the ...rst experiment, I study the e§ects of varying the shape parameter on the equilibrium dynamics without any real rigidity and the trend ination. In Table (2), I report second moments generated by the theoretical models, which are di§erent with respect to the shape of the hazard function. Because I use the Weibull hazard function to calibrate the model, I can change the shape of the hazard function by varying the value of the shape parameter . In this experiment, I focus on the comparison between the baseline Calvo case, with a corresponding shape parameter of = 1, and the increasing hazard models, where falls in the range between 1.6 and 3. In all cases, the moments are for a Hodrick-Prescott ...ltered time series. For each of these hazard functions, two sets of statistics are reported: ...rst, the ...rst-order autocorrelation coe¢ cient of deviations on ination, real marginal cost and output; and second, contemporaneous correlation coe¢ cients between ination and real marginal cost. In all models, I use a persistent technology shock and a transitory monetary shock, whose stochastic properties are speci...ed above.

Table 2: Second moments of the simulated data (HP ...ltered, lambda=1600)

The ...rst noteworthy result from the table is that models with increasing hazard rates generate much higher persistence in ination than in the Calvo model, ceteris paribus. Secondly, increases in the shape parameter reduces the persistence of real marginal cost and output. In the Calvo case, because ination persistence is solely determined by the dynamics of real marginal cost, ination persistence cannot exceed persistence of real marginal cost. In the increasing hazard model, however, the autoregressive terms of real marginal cost are brought into the Phillips curve through lagged expectations, and thus, in comparison to the Calvo model, this new transmission mechanism propagates more ination persistence. Fuhrer (2006) presented empirical evidence showing that it is di¢ cult to have a sizable coe¢ cient on the driving process in the Calvo NKPC and that a reduced form shock in the NKPC explains a signi...cant portion of the ination persistence. We can understand this evidence through the lens of the generalized NKPC. The problem of the conventional NKPC is essentially caused by ignoring terms like lagged inations and lagged expectations. As I show in the analytical result, this is not the case in the more general time-dependent pricing model. The misspeci...ed Phillips curve fails to explain ination persistence with its limited structure. Consequently, we either need to introduce the ad hoc backward-looking behavior or a persistent reduced-form shock to achieve a good ...t to the data. Last but not least, as shown in the ...nal row of the table, the increasing-hazard pricing model also helps to reduce the correlation between ination and current real marginal cost, a rather robust feature of the data (See: e.g. Hornstein, 2007).
Figure 2 shows the impulse responses of the Calvo model compared to the increasing-hazard model with the shape parameter of 2. The left panel depicts the impulse responses of ination

Figure 3: Impulse responses of ination with real rigidity

while the right panel shows those of the output gap to a 1% increase in the annual nominal money growth rate. Without real rigidity and trend ination, we observe that, even though the impulse response function of the increasing-hazard model is somewhat more persistent, the general pattern of the impulse responses are the same in both cases, namely, they drop monotonically back to the steady state.

4.3.2 E§ects of Real Rigidity

As inuentially argued in Woodford (2003), real price rigidity plays an important role in ination

dynamics in addition to nominal rigidity. In this model I introduce real rigidity in a parsimonious

way, following Sbordone (2002). I now set the labor share parameter equal to 0:36. Combining

this with other parameter values in the model, it implies that the real rigidity parameter ( 1 =

a+ + (1 1 a+a

a) ) equals 0.35, representing a

modest level of strategic complementarity.

In Figure (3), I compare the impulse responses of ination to a transitory money growth

shock with and without real rigidity. The left panel shows the comparison in the Calvo model.

Incorporation of real rigidity makes the impulse responses more long-lasting, but still monotonic.

By contrast, in the right panel, impulse responses of ination in the increasing hazard model

change substantially with real rigidity. One can see that not only the persistence of the impulse

response function gets improved, but, more importantly, the shape of it as well. In this case,

the IRF becomes hump-shaped with a peak at around the second quarter.

The economic intuition behind this result is that, on the one hand, increasing hazard function

postpones the timing of the price adjustment, i.e. only a few ...rms adjust their prices immediately

after a shock, and more and more adjust later on. On the other hand, real rigidity helps to

amplify this postponing e§ect even further. Because price decisions are strategic complementary,

when fewer ...rms adjust their prices at the beginning phase of the IRF, even the adjusting

...rms choose a small size of the adjustment. Afterwards, however, when more ...rms reset their

prices, the size of the price adjustment becomes also larger. In another words, the increasing-

hazard pricing together with some degree of real rigidity not only a§ect the timing of the price

adjustment, but also the average magnitude of ...rms' adjustments, leading to a hump-shaped

response.

4.3.3 E§ects of Trend Ination
In his seminal paper, Ascari (2004) has shown that trend ination has important implications for the model's dynamics when the Calvo pricing model is log-linearized around non-zero trend ination. Here I analyze the dynamic e§ects of trend ination in the increasing hazard pricing model. Combining these features is an interesting exercise, because, as I have shown in the previous section, introducing trend ination a§ects all coe¢ cients in the generalized NKPC (See Equation 19), and hence it changes the relative importance between the forward-looking and backward-looking terms in the Phillips curve. As a result, trend ination exerts a larger impact on the dynamics of ination in the increasing-hazard pricing model than in the Calvo case.
In Figure (4), I show the impulse responses of ination and of the output gap to a transitory money growth shock in the increasing hazard model. In the left panel, ination without real rigidity and trend ination reacts to monetary shock monotonically (solid blue line), while the dashed green line depicts the impulse response of ination when real rigidity is present. As shown earlier, this line becomes hump-shaped. Furthermore, when I add a non-zero trend ination into the dynamic structure, the hump becomes even more salient and peaks later (red circled line). On the right panel, impulse responses of the output gap show that the real e§ect of the monetary shock is more persistent in the case when real rigidity and trend ination are presented.
The reason why high trend ination ampli...es the e§ect of increasing hazard functions is, for one, that ...rms in the increasing hazard model are more likely to adjust when their prices are old. When presenting trend ination, relative prices disperse quickly over time and, as a result, high trend ination causes the size of a ...rm's ...rst adjustment is increasing in the time since the shock occurred.
4.3.4 Real E§ects of the Monetary Shock
In the previous sections, I have informally shown that the real e§ects of the monetary shock is larger in the increasing hazard model than in the Calvo case. Here I introduce a quantitative measure of the real e§ects of money. In Table (3), I report the accumulative IRF of the real output gap to a transitory 1% increase in the annual nominal money growth rate. The accumulative IRF is the area below the impulse response function over the whole horizon, and it is in
18

the unit of percentage of the steady state level of real output.

Table 3: Real E§ects of A Transitory Monetary Shock) with varying trend ination

In the Calvo model without any real rigidity, the real e§ect of money is only about 0:09% of real output in the steady state, while this ...gure rises by a factor of 3 when a modest level of real rigidity is present. On the other hand, the increasing hazard model can generate this level of real e§ects of the monetary shock even without any helping features. When adding real rigidity into the increasing hazard model, however, real e§ects rise to 0:48% of steady state real output, and presenting trend ination reinforces real e§ects even further. All in all, the increasing hazard model implies 2-3 times more real e§ects of the monetary shock than the constant-hazard Calvo model.

19

5 Conclusion
The central theme of this study is to show that non-constant hazard functions underlying a pricing assumption implies very di§erent aggregate dynamics. To illustrate this point, I derive a general New Keynesian Phillips curve, reecting an arbitrary hazard function, trend ination and real rigidity.
My main analytical results show that, ...rst, the generalized NKPC involves components including lagged ination, forward-looking and lagged expectations of inations and real marginal cost, which nests the standard Calvo Phillips curve as a limiting case. When the hazard function is constant, the e§ect of lagged ination exactly cancels the e§ects of the lagged expectation terms, so that only current variables and forward-looking expectations remain in the expression. Furthermore, I present a general result, showing that under a certain condition regarding the relationship between the distribution of price durations and the hazard function, the log deviation of the aggregate price in the GCM is equal to that in the GTM. In light of this result, hazard functions and random distribution of price durations are closely related concepts, and when setting them up accordingly, both models imply the same aggregate dynamics.
In the numerical exercise, I show that ination and output are more persistent in the increasing hazard model than in the Calvo case. Introducing real rigidity and trend ination strengthens the dynamic e§ects of the increasing hazard function on ination even further. The model can account for hump-shaped impulse responses of ination to the monetary shock. The real e§ects of the monetary shock implied by the increasing hazard model are 2-3 times higher than those in the Calvo model. However, due to the calibration strategy I choose in my paper, the numerical results are limited in the class of the monotonic shape of hazard functions. For future research, microfounded hazard functions of price setting behavior is clearly a favorable extension for further exploration of the topic.

C Proof for Proposition 1

In the Calvo pricing case, all hazards are equal to a constant between zero and one. Let's denote the constant hazard as h = 1 . We can rearrange the NKPC 18 in the following way:

X1

^t +

k ^t k = (1

X1 ) kEt k (1

X1 X1 ! ) i imct+i k + i i ^t+i k

Then iterating this equation one period forward,

^t+1 + ^t + 2 ^t 1 + 3 ^t 2

= Et+1 (1 )(1

After canceling out equal terms from both sides of the equation, we obtain the following

equation:

^t+1 = Et+1 (1 )(1

Iterate this equation backwards and rearrange it, we get the familiar NKPC of the Calvo model.

^t = Et (1 )(1

D Proof for Proposition 2

D.1 The Generalized Calvo model (GCM)
Firstly, I denote j as the time-since-last-adjustment, which is the vintage label used in the generalized Calvo model. Furthermore, I de...ne J as the maximum duration, in which a price can be ...xed. As a result, in general prices di§er across vintages (j 2 f0; Jg), but, in each vintage, the average price shown in the paper is following the equation (13). After log-linearization, it yields:

D.2 The Generalized Taylor model (GTM)
In the GTM, there are J di§erent price sectors in which prices are set exactly for J periods. As in the GCM, J is de...ned as the maximum duration in which a price can be ...xed. As a result, J should range between 1 and J. In addition, I denote the distribution of price sectors by (J); with J 2 f1; Jg:
In each price sector, the price choice is made to maximize the real pro...t over the next J 1 periods

JX1 max EtfQt;t+j
PtJ j=0

Ytd+jjt

PtJ Pt+j

T Ct+j g Pt+j

given that Qt;t+j = Et

Yt Yt+1

and Ytd+jjt =

PtJ Pt+j

Yt+j, which are consistent with those

in the GCM.

It yields the following ...rst order necessary condition for the optimal price in price sector J :

PtJ =

JP1 j Et[Yt1+j Pt+j1M Ct+j ]
j=0
1 JP1 j Et[Yt1+j Pt+j1]
j=0

After log-linearization, it yields:

JX1 j

p^tJ =

j=0

j=0

(37)

Within each price sector J, there is exactly a 1=J fraction of ...rms that adjust to the new price p^tJ . And there is also exactly a 1=J fraction of ...rms that still use the one-period-old price, p^Jt 1, and so on. Therefore the average price in each sector can be expressed as follows:

ptJ

=

1 J

JX1 p^Jt

k

k=0

(38)

Next, the aggregate price in the GTM can be obtained by summing over all average prices across

sectors, weighted by the distribution of price sectors (J),
