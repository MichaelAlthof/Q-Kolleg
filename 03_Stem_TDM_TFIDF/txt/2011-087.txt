Solving DSGE Models with a Nonlinear Moving Average

Abstract

We introduce a nonlinear infinite moving average as an alternative to the standard state-space policy function for solving nonlinear DSGE models. Perturbation of the nonlinear moving average policy function provides a direct mapping from a history of innovations to endogenous variables, decomposes the contributions from individual orders of uncertainty and nonlinearity, and enables familiar impulse response analysis in nonlinear settings. When the linear approximation is saddle stable and free of unit roots, higher order terms are likewise saddle stable and first order corrections for uncertainty are zero. We derive the third order approximation explicitly and examine the accuracy of the method using Euler equation tests.

1 Introduction
Solving models with a higher than first-order degree of accuracy is an important challenge for DSGE
analysis with the growing interest in nonlinearities. We introduce a novel policy function, the non-
linear infinite moving average, to perturbation analysis in dynamic macroeconomics. This direct
mapping from shocks to endogenous variables neatly dissects the individual contributions of orders
of nonlinearity and uncertainty to the impulse response functions (IRFs). For economists interested
in studying the transmission of shocks in a nonlinear DSGE model, our method offers insight hith-
erto unavailable.
The nonlinear moving average policy function chooses as its state variable basis the infinite history of past shocks.1 This infinite dimensional approach is longstanding in linear models and delivers the same solution as state space methods for linear models.2 For the nonlinear focus of this
paper, however, it provides a different solution. Directly mapping from shocks to endogenous vari-
ables of interest facilitates familiar impulse response analysis and makes clear the caveats introduced
by nonlinearity. These include history dependence, asymmetries, a breakdown of superposition and scale invariance, as well as the potential for harmonic distortion.3
As highlighted by Gomme and Klein (2011) in their second order approximation, deriving per-
turbation solutions with standard linear algebra increases the transparency of the technique and
makes coding the method more straightforward. In that vein, we adapt Vetter's (1973) multidi-
mensional calculus to provide a mechanical system of differentiation that maintains standard linear
algebraic structures for arbitrarily high orders of approximation. We implement our approach nu-
1This is the "external" or "empirical" approach to system theory according to Kalman (1980), who lays out the dichotomy to the `internal" or "state-variable" approach of the state-space methods, now more common to DSGE practitioners. The nonlinear DSGE perturbation literature initiated by Gaspar and Judd (1997), Judd and Guu (1997), and Judd (1998, ch. 13) has thus far operated solely with state-space methods, see Collard and Juillard (2001b), Collard and Juillard (2001a), Jin and Judd (2002), Schmitt-Grohe´ and Uribe (2004), Anderson, Levin, and Swanson (2006), Lombardo and Sutherland (2007), and Kim, Kim, Schaumburg, and Sims (2008).
2Compare, e.g., the state space representations of Uhlig (1999), Klein (2000), or Sims (2001) with the infinite moving-average representations of Muth (1961), Whiteman (1983) or Taylor (1986).

merically by providing an add on for the popular Dynare package.4 We then apply the Volterra representation of the approximated nonlinear infinite moving average solution to the model of Aruoba, Ferna´ndez-Villaverde, and Rubio-Ram´irez (2006) for comparability and explore the resulting decomposition of the contributing components of the responses of variables to exogenous shocks. We develop Euler equation error methods for our infinite dimensional policy function and confirm that our moving average solution produces approximations with a degree of accuracy comparable to state space solutions of the same order of approximation presented in Aruoba, Ferna´ndez-Villaverde, and Rubio-Ram´irez (2006).5
We make two assumptions on the characteristic equation of the first order (i.e., linear) approximation: it is saddle stable and it is free of unit roots. The first is the standard Blanchard and Kahn (1980) assumption and we show that the resulting stability from the first order is passed on to higher order terms. The second is necessary to ensure the boundedness of corrections to constants and essentially embodies the necessary invertibility of a standard state-space policy function to yield our infinite moving average. Together, these assumptions enable us to show that the derivatives of the moving average policy function first order in the perturbation parameter are uniquely zero. For state space methods, Jin and Judd (2002) and Schmitt-Grohe´ and Uribe (2004) emphasize that the equations that these derivatives solve are homogenous equations necessarily admitting a zero solution and Lan and Meyer-Gohde (2011) prove that the uniqueness of the zero solution to n th order follows from the saddle stability of the first order characteristic equation.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The model and the nonlinear infinite moving average policy function are presented in section 2. In section 3, we develop the numerical perturbation of our nonlinear infinite moving average policy function explicitly out to the third order. We then apply our method to a standard stochastic growth model in section 4, a widely used baseline model
4See Adjemian, Bastani, Juillard, Mihoubi, Perendia, Ratto, and Villemot (2011). 5Aruoba, Ferna´ndez-Villaverde, and Rubio-Ram´irez (2006) also explore several global methods (projection, value function iteration) and our choice allows comparability to these other methods. Our focus, however, is on the alternative basis from the nonlinear moving average for local (perturbation) methods and our analysis proceeds accordingly.

for numerical methods in macroeconomics. In section 5, we develop Euler equation error methods for our infinite dimensional solution form and quantify the accuracy of our method. Finally, section 6 concludes.
2 Problem Statement and Solution Form
In this section, we introduce the class of models we analyze and the policy function we propose as a solution. Our class of models is a standard system of (nonlinear) second order expectational difference equations. In contrast with the general practice in the literature, however, the solution will be a policy function that directly maps from realizations of the exogenous variables to the endogenous variables of interest. We will first present the model class followed by the solution form and then conclude with the Taylor/Volterra approximation of the solution and the matrix calculus necessary to follow the derivations in subsequent sections.
2.1 Model Class
We analyze a family of discrete-time rational expectations models given by

(1) 0 = Et[ f (yt-1, yt, yt+1, ut)], where ut = Nit-i i=0
f is an (neq × 1) vector valued function, continuously n-times (the order of approximation to be introduced subsequently) differentiable in all its arguments; yt is an (ny × 1) vector of endogenous variables; the vector of exogenous variables ut is of dimension (nu × 1) and it is assumed that there are as many equations as endogenous variables (neq = ny). N is the (nu × nu) matrix of autoregressive coefficients of ut, presented here in moving average form. The eigenvalues of N are assumed all inside the unit circle so that ut admits this infinite moving average representation; and t is an (ne × 1) vector of exogenous shocks of the same dimension (nu = ne). Our software add on forces N = 0 to align with Dynare.6
6See again Adjemian, Bastani, Juillard, Mihoubi, Perendia, Ratto, and Villemot (2011). Thus in practice, the economist using Dynare must incorporate any serial correlation into the vector yt . This choice is not made in the exposition here primarily as the admissibility of serial correlation in the exogenous driving force brings our first order
3

Additionally, t is assumed independently and identically distributed such that E(t) = 0 and E(t[n]) exists and is finite for all n up to and including the order of approximation to be introduced subsequently.7
As is usual in perturbation methods, we introduce an auxiliary parameter   [0, 1] to scale the uncertainty in the model. The value  = 1 corresponds to the "true" stochastic model under study and  = 0 represents the deterministic version of the model. Following Anderson, Levin, and Swanson (2006, p. 4), we do not scale the realizations of the exogenous variable up to (including) t with , as the realizations of {t, t-1, . . .} are known with certainty at t. The perturbation parameter does not enter the problem statement explicitly, but only implicitly through the policy functions, and
its role will become clear as we introduce the solution form and its approximation.
2.2 Solution Form
Let the policy function take the causal one-sided infinite sequence of shocks as its state vector and,
following Anderson, Levin, and Swanson (2006, p. 3), let it be time invariant for all t, analytic and ergodic.8 The unknown policy function is then given by
(2) yt = y(, t, t-1, . . .) Note that  enters as a separate argument. As the scale of uncertainty changes, so too will the policy function y itself change. Time invariance and scaling uncertainty give us (3) yt-1 = y-(, t-1, t-2, . . .) (4) yt+1 = y+(, t+1, t, t-1, . . .) where t+1  t+1
derivation in line with earlier moving average approaches for linear models, e.g., Taylor (1986). 7The notation t [n] represents Kronecker powers, t [n] is the n'th fold Kronecker product of t with itself:
t  t · · ·  t . For simulations and the like, of course, more specific decisions regarding the distribution of the exoge-
n times
nous processes will have to be made. Kim, Kim, Schaumburg, and Sims (2008, p. 3402) emphasize that distributional assumptions like these are not entirely local assumptions. Dynare (Adjemian, Bastani, Juillard, Mihoubi, Perendia, Ratto, and Villemot 2011) assumes normality of the underlying shocks.
8Analyticity is required for the convergence of asymptotic expansion as the order of approximation becomes infinite and ergodicity rules out explosive and nonfundamental solutions.
4

The notation, y, y-, and y+, is adopted so that we can keep track of the source (through yt , yt-1, and yt+1 respectively) of any given partial derivative of the policy function. Due to the assumption of time invariance, y, y-, and y+ are the same function differing only in the timing of their arguments. The importance of discriminating among these functions will become clear in the next section. The term t+1 in (4) is the source of uncertainty, via t+1, that we are perturbing with . The known function u of the exogenous variable is rewritten similarly

(5) ut = u(, t, t-1, . . .) = Nit-i i=0 For notational ease in derivation, we will define vector xt, containing the complete set of variables
(6) xt  yt-1 yt yt+1 ut  xt is of dimension (nx × 1) with (nx = 3ny + ne). With the policy function of the form (2), (3) and (4), plus the function of the exogenous variable (5), we can write xt as (7) xt = x(, t+1, t , t-1, . . .) The function x is time invariant, analytic and ergodic, following from the assumptions on y and u above.
2.3 Approximation: Taylor/Volterra Series Approximation
We will approximate the solution, (2), as a Taylor series expanded around a nonstochastic steady state, x, which is the solution to the function (8) 0 = f (y, y, y, 0) = f (x) that is, the function f in (1) with all shocks, past and present, set to zero, and all uncertainty regarding the future eliminated ( = 0). Furthermore (9) y = y(0, 0, . . .) represents the solution (2) evaluated at the nonstochastic steady state.
Following general practice in the perturbation literature, we pin down the approximation of the unknown policy function (2) by successively differentiating (1) and solving the resulting systems
5

for the unknown coefficients. The algorithm is detailed in section 3. Notice that, since f is a vector valued function, successive differentiation of f with respect to its arguments, which are vectors in general, will generate a hypercube of partial derivatives. We adapt the structure of matrix derivatives defined in Vetter (1973) to unfold the hypercube conformable to the Kronecker product, collecting partial derivatives from successive differentiation of f in two dimensional matrices. This allows us to avoid tensor notation and use standard linear algebra.
A similar approach can be found in Gomme and Klein (2011). They use the matrix derivative structure and the associated chain rule of Magnus and Neudecker (2007, ch. 6) to unfold a three dimensional cube of second partial derivatives. The approach does not appear to be easily adaptable to orders of approximation higher than two, as Magnus and Neudecker (2007) do not provide methods that go beyond the second differential. Lombardo and Sutherland (2007) also derive a second order solution without appealing to tensor notation. Their approach benefits from their use of the vech operator to eliminate redundant quadratic terms. Our approach, however, provides a mechanical recipe applicable to higher orders, extending the ideas of these existing approaches past the second order.
The formal definition of our matrix derivative structure is in the Appendix. This structure will make the presentation of the solution method more transparent--successive differentiation of f to the desired order of approximation is a mechanical application of the following theorem
Theorem 2.1. A Multidimensional Calculus For the matrix-valued functions F, G, A, and H and vector-valued functions J and C there exists
an operator Dx indicating differentiation with respect to a vector x. Unless indicated otherwise, all matrices and vectors are understood to be functions of the vector B and we leave this dependency implicit.

directly maps the exogenous innovations to endogenous variables up the M-th order. The kernels

at m collects all the coefficients associated with the m'th fold Kronecker products of exogenous in-

novations i1, i2, ... and im periods ago. For a given set of indices, i1, i2, ... and im, the sum over n gathering terms in powers of the perturbation parameter , corrects the kernel for uncertainty up

to the n-th order, thereby enabling a useful classification of the contributions of uncertainty to the

model. That is, we can first decompose the Volterra series into kernels associated with the order of

approximation in the state space itself--the zeroth kernel being constants, the first order kernel be-

ing linear in the product space of the history of innovations, the second being quadratic in the same,

etc. Thereafter, we can decompose each of the kernels into successively higher order corrections for

uncertainty according to the order in --yn represents the n'th order correction for uncertainty of the zeroth order kernel, yni1 the n'th order correction for uncertainty of the first order kernel, yni1i2 the n'th order correction for uncertainty of the second order kernel, and so on.

For a different perspective, observe that moving to a higher order in (10) comprises two changes:

(i) adding a higher order kernel and (ii) opening up all existing kernels to a higher order correction

for uncertainty.10 The change in moving from an M - 1'th to M'th order approximation is

(t-i1  t-i2  · · · t-im)

The difference can be written compactly despite the two changes, as change (i) is an M'th or-

der kernel with a zeroth order correction for uncertainty (for m = M above, yM-mi1i2···imM-m = y0i1i2···im0 = yi1i2···im). From (ii) comes then additionally a first order correction for uncertainty in the M - 1'th order kernel, a second order uncertainty correction for the M - 2'th kernel and so on up

to the M'th order correction for uncertainty in the constant or zeroth order kernel. The uncertainty

correction at a given order directly depends on the moments of future shocks at each order and so (ii)

can be interpreted as successively opening each kernel up to higher moments in the distribution of

future shocks, while (i) maintains the standard Taylor notion of moving to a higher order polynomial

(captured by the kernels in our Volterra series).
10We are grateful to Michael Burda for suggesting this interpretation.

the first and second order corrections for uncertainty respectively, leading to the second order accu-

concerning future shocks of the first-order response to the history of shocks. The first order correc-

tions for uncertainty will turn out to be zero in this case, a familiar result from state-space analyses.11

For the case of M = 2, the task at hand is to pin down numerical values for y, yi, y, y ji, yi, and

y2 using the information in (1). In the next section, we provide explicit derivations to third order, which is novel in the literature.12

3 Numerical Solution of the Perturbation Approximation

It this section, we lay out the method for solving for the coefficients of the approximated solution.
Solving for the first-order terms is primarily an application of methods well known in the literature.
Similarly to existing state-space methods, solving for higher-order terms operates successively on
terms from lower orders with linear methods. In contrast to state-space methods, the system of
equations for the coefficients at all orders of approximation is a system of difference equations with
identical homogenous components, enabling the stability from the first order to be passed on to
higher orders. Terms linear in the perturbation parameter are zero, as is the case with the state-
11See Jin and Judd (2002), Schmitt-Grohe´ and Uribe (2004), and Kim, Kim, Schaumburg, and Sims (2008). 12See Andreasen (forthcoming) for a notable extension of Schmitt-Grohe´ and Uribe's (2004) method out to the third order. The author's appendix with one third order term occupying two pages highlights the advantage of our notation.

space policy function. The moving average solution function, however, requires us to rule out unit roots in the first order approximation along with the standard saddle point assumptions to ensure the boundedness of uncertainty corrections to constants.
The method can be outlined as follows.13 Inserting the policy functions for yt-1, yt , and yt+1-- equations, (3), (2), and (4) respectively--along with the analogous representation, (5), for the exogenous driving force ut into the model (1) yields (13) 0 = Et[ f (y-(, t-1, t-2, . . .), y(, t, t-1, . . .), y+(, t+1, t, t-1, . . .), u(, t, t-1, . . .))] a function with arguments , t, t-1, . . .. At each order of approximation, we take the collection of derivatives of f from the previous order (for the first-order, we start with the function f itself) and
1. differentiate each of the derivatives of f from the previous order with respect to each of its arguments (i.e., , t, t-1, . . .)
2. evaluate the partial derivatives of f and of y at the nonstochastic steady state
3. apply the expectations operator and evaluate using the given moments
4. set the resulting expression to zero and solve for the unknown partial derivatives of y.
The partial derivatives of y, obtained in step (4) at each order, constitute the missing partial derivatives for the Taylor-Volterra approximation of the policy function y. They are numeric and used again in step (2) of the next higher order. This introduces the potential for the compounding of numerical errors as we move to higher orders as highlighted by Anderson, Levin, and Swanson (2006). The set of derivatives of f obtained in step (1), however, are symbolic at each order, limiting the source for potential error compounding to the partial derivatives of the policy function.
13See Anderson, Levin, and Swanson (2006, p. 9) for a similar outline in their state-space context.
10

3.1 First-Order Approximation
We are seeking the first order approximation of the policy function (2), evaluated at the nonstochastic steady state (x), of the form

(14) yt = y + y +  yit-i, i = 0, 1, 2, . . . i=0
The task at hand is to pin down the partial derivatives, y and yi. Even in the first-order case, the problem is infinite dimensional owing to the infinite moving average representation of the solution. As explained by Taylor (1986, p. 2003) for the linear problem the original stochastic difference equations in yt become deterministic difference equations in the moving-average coefficients of yt. This motivates our choice of beginning with the unknown terms in the history of shocks and then turning to those in , as the problem at higher-orders of approximation will inherit a similar structure.
To determine yi, we differentiate f in (13) with respect to some t-i (15) DtT-i f = fxxi Evaluating this at the nonstochastic steady state (x) and setting its expectation to zero yields (16) Et (DtT-i f ) x = fy- yi-1 + fyyi + fy+ yi+1 + fuui = 0
for i = 0, 1, . . ., with y-1 = 0 a second order linear deterministic difference equation in the matrices yi--the derivatives of the vector-valued y function with respect to its i - 1'th  element. That is, yi contains the linear moving average coefficients of yt with respect to the elements of t-i. Equation (16) is an inhomogeneous version of Anderson and Moore's (1985) saddle-point problem, solved in detail by Anderson (2010).
We make two assumptions regarding the difference equation system (16).
Assumption 3.1. Saddle stability Of the 2ny z  C such that det fy- + fyz + fy+z2 = 0, there are exactly ny with |z| < 1.
Assumption 3.2. No unit roots
11

There is no z  C with |z| = 1 and det fy- + fyz + fy+z2 = 0
The first assumption is standard, fulfilling the Blanchard and Kahn (1980) condition. The second has been found in other analyses, e.g., Klein (2000), and here ensures the solvability of terms homogenous in --i.e., uncertainty corrections to the constant. The two assumptions are our versions of Jin and Judd's (2002) solvability constraints. In contrast to the conditions for state-space policy function from Lan and Meyer-Gohde (2011), our moving average policy function requires us to rule out unit roots. Intuitively from the state-space perspective, unit roots must be ruled out to allow the state-space solution to be inverted, yielding the nonlinear moving average we work with. As in the case of an explosive state-space solution, the impact of an initial condition on the endogenous variables would fail to vanish and constants (i.e., terms involving the perturbation parameter) would fail to converge when solving out a unit-root state-space solution back into the infinite past.
Anderson's (2010, p. 479) method can be applied under our assumptions 3.1 and 3.2 along with the first-order linear autoregressive ut (i.e., ui = Ni),14 delivering the unique stable solution to (16) (17) yi = yi-1 + 1ui, with y-1 = 0 a convergent recursion from which we can recover the linear moving-average terms or yi's.15
To determine y, we differentiate f in (13) with respect to  (18) D f = fxDx
where Dx = x + xt+1 Evaluating this at x and setting its expectation to zero yields
(19) Et (D f ) x = ( fy- + fy + fy+)y = 0 as Et(t+1) = 0. From assumption (3.2), it follows that (20) det( fy- + fy + fy+) = 0
14Alternatively, one can apply Klein's (2000) QZ algorithm to this deterministic approach to yield the solution above. Note, as discussed by Meyer-Gohde (2010, pp. 986-987), we are working on a deterministic saddle-point problem in the moving-average coefficients and not on a stochastic saddle-point problem in the endogenous variables themselves.
15We have tacitly assumed that this solution exists, see Anderson (2010, p. 483) for the details. In Klein's (2000) notation, Z11 of the QZ decomposition must be invertible, the added proviso of translatability.
12

and hence (21) y = 0 The first-order correction of the constant for uncertainty is zero. Lan and Meyer-Gohde (2011) show for state space methods that saddle point stability is sufficient to ensure the zero solution for the state space equivalent to (19) is unique, completing the observation by Jin and Judd (2002) and Schmitt-Grohe´ and Uribe (2004, p. 761) that the system of equations "is linear and homogeneous" in their first-order correction and "[t]hus, if a unique solution exists" it must be zero. This result carries over to our moving average by ruling out unit roots to ensure the invertibility of the state space representation. The result itself reflects the rather obvious fact that opening the expansion to a moment of the future distribution of shocks will change nothing if this moment (Et [t+1]) is exactly zero.
Gathering the results of this section, the first order approximation of the policy function (2), which can be thought of as an extension of Muth (1961), Taylor (1986), and others, reduces to

(22) yt = y +  yit-i, i = 0, 1, 2, . . . i=0
Note that (22) is independent of , confirming the certainty equivalent nature of the first-order solution.

3.2 Second-Order Approximation

We now move on to the second order approximation of the policy function (2) evaluated at the

nonstochastic steady state, (x), and taking the first order results as given of the form

+ (yi

y j,i(t- j

 t-i)

The task is to pin down the three second order derivatives of the y function, y j,i, y2 and y,i. The

equations governing y j,i and y,i will be difference equations with homogenous components identical

to those in (16), with the equation in y,i being homogenous in accordance with Schmitt-Grohe´ and

Uribe (2004) and others. The no-unit-root assumption will be crucial again in solving for the term

13

y2, preventing this constant correction for uncertainty induced by the potential for future shocks from becoming arbitrarily large.

We first differentiate (15) with respect to some t- j, delivering y j,i, the second derivatives of the y function with respect to all pairs of t-i and t- j. As Judd (1998, p. 477) points out, the resulting system of equations remains a linear system, only now in the second derivatives that are being sought

a second order linear deterministic difference equation in y j,i. The coefficients on the homogeneous components of the forgoing and (16) are identical. The inhomogeneous components have a first

order Markov representation (see the shifting and transition matrices defined in the Appendix) in the Kronecker product of the first-order coefficients.16 The resulting expression is

(26) fy- y j-1,i-1 + fyy j,i + fy+ y j+1,i+1 + fx2 (1  1)(S j  Si) = 0 for j, i = 0, 1, . . ., with y j,i = 0, for j, i < 0

The stable solution of the forgoing, analogously to the first order, takes the form

(27) y j,i = y j-1,i-1 + 2(S j  Si), with y j,i = 0,  j, i < 0

Note that  in this solution is known. It is the same uniquely stable  as in the first order solution

(17) due to the fact that the system (25) and (16) have identical homogeneous components. To

determine 2, we substitute (27) in (25), using the shifting matrices and matching coefficients

(28) ( fy + fy+)2 + fy+2(1  1) = - fx2(1  1) This is a type of Sylvester equation, the solution of which is presented in detail by Kamenik (2005).

Applying the techniques developed in Lan and Meyer-Gohde (2011), the existence and uniqueness
16Thus, our nonlinear moving average solution parallels nonlinear state space solutions in a manner analogous to the linear case, where the recursion is in the coefficients as opposed to the variables themselves. Instead of products of the state-variables entering into the solution, we have products of the first-order coefficients.

14

of the solution to the Sylvester equation can be shown guaranteed by the saddle point assumption.

Next we pin down y,i, the second derivatives of the y function with respect to t-i and  sequentially, by differentiating (15) with respect to . The resulting linear system is

(29) D2tT-i f = fx2 (Dx  xi) + fxDxi where Dxi = x,i + x,i(t+1  Ine)
Note that the additional potential derivative, D2tT-i f , is simply equal to the derivative in the text, D2tT-i f .17 Evaluating (29) at x, taking expectations, noting that y = 0, and setting the resulting expression to zero yields

(30)

Et (D2tT-i f ) x = fy- y,i-1 + fyy,i + fy+ y,i+1 = 0

for i = 0, 1, . . ., with y,-1 = 0

The unique stable solution takes the form

(31) y,i = y,i-1, for i = 0, 1, . . . , with y,-1 = 0

as the system at hand is identical to the homogenous component of the first order system (16).

Combined with the initial condition y,-1 = 0, the forgoing delivers

(32) y,i = 0, for i = 0, 1, . . .

Again, we confirm Schmitt-Grohe´ and Uribe's (2004) and Jin and Judd's (2002) result that terms

with a first order uncertainty correction are zero. Like Lan and Meyer-Gohde (2011) we have the

addition result that saddle stability on the first-order solution show that not only is zero a solution

(the equation is homogenous), but that it is also the unique solution.
17 Although the derivative operator D works on Kronecker products (i.e. D2tT-i = D2tT-i f ) and although the Kronecker product is not generally commutative,  is a scalar and, thus, commutation is preserved. This result can be seen by exploiting the properties of the commutation matrix Km,n as follows. Take the first term in D2tT-i , for example, and insert the identity matrix: fx2 Inx2 (Dx  xi). This can be rewritten as fx2 Knx,nxKnx,nx(Dx  xi). Pre-multiplying the Kronecker product of a matrix and a column vector (each with nx rows) with Knx,nx reverses their order (see Theorem 3.1.(ix) of Magnus and Neudecker (1979, p. 384)) and, thus, Knx,nx(Dx  xi) = xi  Dx. Now fx2 = Dx2T xT f and postmultiplying a Kronecker product of row vectors each of dimension nx with Knx,nx reverses their order. But the two row vectors are identical, so reversing their order changes nothing: fx2 = Dx2T xT f Knx,nx = Dx2T xT f = fx2 . Combining the two yields fx2 (Dx  xi) = fx2 (xi  Dx). Proceeding likewise with the second term in D2tT-i completes the argument. Accordingly for higher-order derivatives, the order in which derivatives with respect to  appear is inconsequential as it is a scalar and we choose to have the 's appear first.

15

Finally, to determine y2, the second derivative of the y function with respect to , we differentiate (18) with respect to , the resulting linear system is

(33) D22 f = fx2 (Dx  Dx) + fxD22x where D22x = x2 + 2x,t+1 + x2 (t+1  t+1)
Evaluating this at x and setting its expectation to zero yields

(34) Et (D22 f ) x = [ fy+y02 + fy+2 (y0  y0)]Et(t+1  t+1) + ( fy- + fy + fy+ )y2 = 0 therefore we can recover y2 by (35) y2 = -( fy- + fy + fy+ )-1[ fy+y02 + fy+2 (y0  y0)]Et(t+1  t+1) By assumption, the second moment of the exogeneous variable, Et(t+1  t+1), is given.
As the model approaches a unit root from below, the effect of uncertainty on the constant be-

comes unbounded. This result is novel, giving additional meaning to the invertibility condition of

assumption 3.2: from a state-space perspective, the correction for uncertainty will be accumulated

forward starting from the nonstochastic steady state; if the state space contains a unit root, this ac-

cumulated correction will become unbounded and there will be no finite stochastic steady state to

which the model can converge.

(t- j  t-i)

The task at hand is to pin down some third derivatives of the y function, including yk, j,i, y2,i, y, j,i

and y3. Computing these derivatives largely resembles the computation of the second derivatives in

the previous section. We relegate the details to the Appendix and focus on the results here.

To determine yk, j,i, we differentiate (24) with respect to some shocks t-k, delivering the third derivatives of the y function with respect to all triplets of the shocks. The resulting system, evalu-

ated at x and in expectation, of equations is a linear deterministic second order difference equation

in yk, j,i. The homogeneous components in (A-17) are identical to those in (16) and (25) and the inhomogeneous components can again be rearranged to have a first order Markov representation

Et (D3tT-ktT- jtT-i f ) x = fy- yk-1, j-1,i-1 + fyyk, j,i + fy+ yk+1, j+1,i+1 + fx3 fx2 fx2 fx2 3Sk, j,i = 0 (39) for k, j, i = 0, 1, . . ., with yk, j,i = 0, for k, j, i < 0

The unique stable solution of the forgoing, analogously to lower orders, takes the form

(40) yk, j,i = yk-1, j-1,i-1 + 3Sk, j,i, with yk, j,i = 0, for k, j, i < 0

and 3 can be solved for by, again, formulating an appropriate Sylvester equation. To determine y, j,i, we differentiate (24) with respect to , evaluate at x, take expectations, set

17

the resulting expression to zero, and recall the results from lower orders, yielding

(41)

Et (D3tT- jtT-i f ) x = fy- y, j-1,i-1 + fyy, j,i + fy+ y, j+1,i+1 = 0

for j, i = 0, 1, . . ., with y, j,i = 0, for j, i < 0

or

(42) y, j,i = 0, for j, i = 0, 1, . . .

again confirming Schmitt-Grohe´ and Uribe's (2004) and Jin and Judd's (2002) result that terms with

a first order uncertainty have zero as a solution and Lan and Meyer-Gohde's (2011) result that saddle

stability on the first-order solution ensures that the zero solution is also the unique solution.

To determine y2,i, we differentiate (29) with respect to , evaluate at x, take expectations, set the resulting expression to zero, and recall the results from lower orders, yielding

Et (D32tT-i f ) x = fx3 {[(x  x)Et(t+1  t+1)]  xi} + 2 fx2 (x  xi)[Et(t+1  t+1)  Ine] + fx2 {(x2  xi) + ([x2Et (t+1  t+1)]  xi)} + fx{x2,i + x2,i[Et(t+1  t+1)  Ine]}
(43) =0, for i = 0, 1, . . ., with y-1 = 0

which is still a second order deterministic difference equation. The homogeneous components are

packed in x2,i and they are identical to those in (16) and (25). The inhomogeneous components can again be rearranged to have a first order Markov representation by using the shifting and transition

matrices defined in the Appendix, and the unique stable solution of the forgoing takes the form

(44) y2,i = y2,i-1 + Si, with y2,-1 = 0 where  can be solved for by, again, formulating an appropriate Sylvester equation.
To determine y3, we differentiate (33) with respect to , evaluate at x, take expectations, set the resulting expression to zero, and recall the results from lower orders, yielding

Et (D33 f ) x = fx3 [(x  x  x)Et(t+1  t+1  t+1)] + 2 fx2[Et (t+1  t+1  t+1)(x  x2)] (45) + fx2 [(x2  x)Et (t+1  t+1  t+1)] + fx[y3 + x3 Et (t+1  t+1  t+1)] = 0 as the third moment of t is assumed given, Et(t+1  t+1  t+1) is known. Recovering y3 from the

18

forgoing is straightforward under the assumption (3.2). When t is normally distributed,18 however, Et (t+1  t+1  t+1) = 0. Hence

(46) y3 = 0

Higher order approximations of the policy function (2) can be computed using the same steps.

Moving through higher orders of approximation successively, the undetermined partial derivatives of

the policy function will always be terms of highest order being considered, ensuring that the leading

coefficient matrix is fx. Thus, for all time varying components, the difference equations in these

components will have the same homogenous representation--for non time varying components (i.e.

derivatives with respect to  only), the leading coefficient matrix fx along with assumption 3.2 ensure

the uniqueness of their solution. The inhomogenous elements of the difference equations in the time

varying components will be composed of terms of lower order, which are necessarily constants

(terms in the given moments and derivatives with respect to  only) or products of stable recursions
18As is the case in Dynare, see Adjemian, Bastani, Juillard, Mihoubi, Perendia, Ratto, and Villemot (2011).

(time varying components of lower order). As the latter are likewise stable, we can conclude from assumption 3.1 that the difference equations in all time varying components will be saddle stable; hence, the stability of the first order recursion is passed on to all higher orders.

4 Stochastic Neoclassical Growth Model

In this section, we examine two versions of the stochastic neoclassical growth model to demonstrate

the method. This model has been used in numerous studies comparing numerical techniques and

is a natural benchmark. We begin with the special case of log preferences in consumption and full

depreciation that has a known solution to illustrate the relation of the nonlinear moving average to

the more familiar state-space solution. We then move on to the baseline specification of Aruoba,

Ferna´ndez-Villaverde, and Rubio-Ram´irez's (2006) comprehensive study with inseparable utility to

foster comparability with their results. This version of the model lacks a known solution and must be

approximated. Using our nonlinear moving average solution, we analyze the contributing elements

to the response of the model's endogenous variables to a technology shock and highlight the features

of the multidimensional kernels and impulse responses.

The model is populated by an infinitely lived representative household seeking to maximize its

expected discounted lifetime utility given by

(49)

E0


tU (Ct , Lt) , with U (Ct, Lt) =
t=0

Ct (1 - Lt )1- 1- 1-

where Ct is consumption, Lt labor, and   (0, 1) the discount factor, subject to

(50) Ct + Kt = eZt Kt-1Lt1- + (1 - ) Kt-1

where Kt is the capital stock accumulated today for productive purposes tomorrow, Zt a stochastic

productivity process,   [0, 1] the capital share, and   [0, 1] the depreciation rate. Output Yt is given by eZt Kt-1Lt1- and investment It by Kt - (1 - ) Kt-1. Productivity is described by
(51) Zt = ZZt-1 + Z,t, Z,t  N 0, 2Z

with Z  (0, 1) a persistence parameter, Z,t the innovation to the process, and Z the standard

20

deviation of the innovations.

The solution is characterized by the intertemporal Euler condition equalizing the expected present-

discounted utility value of Ct (1 - Lt )1-

plus the budget constraint (50) and the technology shock (51). Collecting the four equations into

a vector of functions, the set of equilibrium conditions can be written 0 = Et[ f (yt-1, yt, yt+1, ut)] where yt = Ct Kt Lt Zt  and ut = Z,t .

4.1 Logarithmic Preferences and Complete Depreciation Special Case

The first case we will examine is the simple stochastic neoclassical growth model under log prefer-

ences and complete capital depreciation. This model can be expressed in terms of one endogenous

variable, enabling a scalar version of the method to be studied, and possesses a well-known closed-

form solution for the state-space policy function. We show how our policy function relates to this

well-known state-space example and use our resulting closed-form policy function as a basis for an

initial appraisal of our method.

Accordingly, let U (Ct, Lt) in (49) be given by ln (Ct ),19 normalize Lt = 1 and set  = 1 in (50).

Combining (50) with (52) in this case yields

(54)

0 = Et eZt Kt-1 - Kt -1 -  eZt+1Kt - Kt+1 -1 eZt+1Kt-1

This particular case has a well-known closed form solution for the state-space policy function:
Kt = eZt Kt-1. However, we are interested in its infinite nonlinear moving average representation
19That is, set  and  to one, subtracting an appropriate constant and extending the utility function over the removable singularity at  = 1.

21

and guess that the logarithm of the solution is linear in the infinite history of technology innovations


(55) ln (Kt) = ln (K¯ ) + b jZ,t- j j=0

Inserting the guess and the infinite moving average representation for Zt , (54) can be rewritten

solve (56) and verify the guess, (55).

Not surprisingly, this solution can also be deduced directly from the known state-space solu-

tion. Take logs of Kt = eZt Kt-1, yielding ln (Kt) = ln () + Zt + ln (Kt-1). Making use of

the lag operator, L, and defining  (L) = j=0 (L) j, the foregoing can be written as ln (Kt) =

(1 - )-1 ln () + (1 - L)-1  (L) Z,t and restating in levels gives

where b (L) = (1 - L)-1  (L) = j=0 b jL j as before.

This special case offers a simple check of the numerical approach. We define K^t = ln(Kt) and

use Kt = exp(K^t ) to reexpress (54) as20

0 = Et

eZt+K^t-1 - eK^t

ezt+1+K^t - eK^t+1

eZt+1+(-1)K^t

With this reformulation, the first-order expansion is the true policy rule in this special case. That is (59) can be rewritten as 0 = Et[ f (yt-1, yt, yt+1, ut)] where yt = Kt Zt  and ut = Z,t .
To check our method, we calculate the kernels of the third order accurate nonlinear moving

average solution of (59) out 500 periods, following the parameterization of Hansen (1985) for the

remaining parameters by setting  = 0.36, 1/ = 1.01,  = 0.95, and Z = 0.00712. Our method
20See Ferna´ndez-Villaverde and Rubio-Ram´irez (2006) for more on change of variable techniques such as this.

22

successfully identifies y j,i, yk, j,i, and y2,i as being zero and the largest absolute difference in yi from those implied by the analytic solution was 4.3368 × 10-18. This first check, while encouraging, is far from comprehensive. In section 5, additional and potentially more meaningful measures will be examined.
4.2 CRRA-Incomplete Depreciation Case
We now move to the general case of Aruoba, Ferna´ndez-Villaverde, and Rubio-Ram´irez (2006). Following their parameterization, we relax the complete depreciation and log preferences of the previous section, see table 1. As no known closed-form solution exists, we will need an approximation. We reexpress variables in logs, commensurate with a loglinear approximation. This choice is additionally motivated by our results in section 5 that indicate a log specification improves the accuracy of the approximation.
[Table 1 about here.]
For higher-order approximations, our policy function (2), yt = y(, t, t-1, t-2, . . .), will straightforwardly enable impulse response analysis. That is, consider a shock in t to an element of t, one measure21 for the response of yt through time to this impulse is given by the sequence
yt = y(, t, 0, 0, 0, . . .) yt+1 = y(, 0, t, 0, 0, . . .) yt+2 = y(, 0, 0, t, 0, . . .) (60) ...
[Figure 1 about here.]
21 Note that we are assuming that yt- j = y(, 0, 0, . . .),  j > 0. Ferna´ndez-Villaverde, Guerro´n-Quintana, RubioRam´irez, and Uribe (2011), for example, examine the responses starting from the mean of the ergodic distribution as opposed to the stochastic steady state that we assume. Note that in a nonlinear environment, variables will wander away deterministically from the ergodic mean to the stochastic steady state when the response to a single shock is examined, as the maintenance of variables around the ergodic mean requires the model to be constantly buffeted with shocks. We argue for our measure as it eliminates such deterministic trends in impulse responses.
23

Figure 1 depicts the impulse responses and their contributing components from the kernels of different orders for capital, consumption, and labor to a positive, one standard deviation shock in Z,t.22 The upper panel displays the impulse responses at first, second, and third order as deviations from their respective (non)stochastic steady states (themselves in the middle right panel) and the first feature to notice is that they are indistinguishable to the eye. This is not surprising, as it is well known that the neoclassical growth model is nearly loglinear. In the middle column of panels in the lower half of each figure, the contributions to the total impulse responses from the second and third-order kernels yi,i and yi,i,i are displayed. Note that these components display multiple `humps' to either side of the `hump' in the first-order component (upper-left panel), this is in accordance with the artefact of harmonic distortion discussed in Priestly (1988, p. 27).
The second-order contributions of capital and consumption are positive and that of labor is negative. This reflects the combination of a precautionary reaction and nonlinear propagation mechanism of technology shocks. A technology shock is exploited by accumulating a disproportionately large capital stock, which enables a larger increase in consumption (but of an order of magnitude smaller than capital in terms of second order contribution, as a precautionary reaction) and a smaller increase in labor (due to the second order downward correction) than the linear model would predict. In the case of a negative technology shock (not pictured), the first order components would simply be their mirror images with opposite sign. The second order contributions, however, would remain entirely unchanged following from the symmetry of the quadratic. In combination, the second order approximation can thus capture time invariant asymmetries in the impulse responses.23
22In terms of the "conceptual difficulties" laid out in Koop, Pesaran, and Potter (1996), we are assuming a particular history of shocks (namely the infinite absence thereof--such interaction will be addressed later), are examining a particular shock realization (positive, one standard deviation: due to the nonlinearity, asymmetries and the absence of scale invariance are a potential confound), and ignoring distributional composition issues by examining a realization of a single structural shock irrespective of its potential correlation with other shocks (in this model there is only one shock, so this is moot anyway).
23Time varying asymmetries would be captured by y2, j,i, require a fourth order approximation as the term y, j,i from the third order approximation is zero, see section 3.3.
24

The precautionary component can likewise be seen in the upward correction of the steady states in the rightmost panels. In the stochastic steady state, agents face uncertainty regarding future shocks and accumulate a precautionary stock of capital through increased labor efforts and disburse this as increased consumption when shocks fail to manifest themselves. The lower left panel contains the contributions from y2i the second order (in ) time-varying correction for risk, this demonstrates an initial wealth effect with consumption increasing and capital and labor decreasing relative to a nonstochastic environment.24 Nonlinear impulse responses are not scale invariant, as noted also by Ferna´ndez-Villaverde, Guerro´n-Quintana, Rubio-Ram´irez, and Uribe (2011): for example, while the first-order component scales linearly with the magnitude of the shock, the second-order order component scales quadratically. As shocks become larger, a linear approximation would generally not suffice to characterize the dynamics of the model. This is precisely the effect of higher-order terms: as the magnitude of the shock increases, these higher order terms begin to contribute more significantly to the total impulse, attempting to correct the responses for the greater departure from the steady state. For this model, however, one would need to consider shocks of unreasonable magnitude to generate any notable effects from the higher-order terms on the total impulse, reinforcing the conventional wisdom that this model is nearly linear in the variables' logarithms.
[Figure 2 about here.]
In figure 2, the impulse responses to a technology shock with different values (2, 5, and 10) of the CRRA parameter  are overlayed. Note that for all three values of , the first order components dominate. While changes in  do change the periodicity of the harmonic distortion as well as the shape and sign of some second and third order components, the constant and time-varying corrections for risk display a significant change in magnitude. As  is increased, the stochastic steady state is associated with higher constant precautionary stocks of capital and the time-varying component
24Ferna´ndez-Villaverde and Rubio-Ram´irez (2010) discusses the nonlinear impact of shocks in the production function and similar wealth effects.
25

displays a magnified wealth effect. Though not very large, the precautionary channel of the second order kernel is highlighted by the experiment, with both the second order contributions of capital and labor increasing minimally and that of consumption decreasing initially. At values above 20 (not pictured), the time-varying corrections for risk begin to contribute noticeably to the total impulse, whereas shocks several orders of magnitude larger than a standard deviation are needed to propel the nonlinear kernels to significance.
[Figure 3 about here.]
Figures 3 and 4 draw the second and third order kernels, y j,i and yk, j,i, as they depend on differing time separation (potentially i = j = k) of shocks. As likewise discussed in Ferna´ndez-Villaverde, Guerro´n-Quintana, Rubio-Ram´irez, and Uribe (2011), impulse responses are not invariant to the history of shocks. The third order kernels in figure 4 are four dimensional objects, captured by our use of colors inside a cube; we slice the cube with a diagonal plane whose diagonal (i = j = k) is the third order contribution (though not scaled to the magnitude of the shock) in figure 1. The unscaled contribution from the second-order kernel in the impulse responses in figure 1 can be found along the diagonals of the kernels (i = j) in figures 3. The off diagonal (i = j = k) elements `correct' for the history of shocks. That is, in addition to the individual second-order contribution that can be found along the diagonals in figure 3, an off diagonal correction to the second order contribution would be needed for shocks from the past. The deep valleys on either side of the kernels for consumption and capital that bottom out at about fifty periods indicate a substantially persistent nature or `memory' of the second order kernels.
[Figure 4 about here.]
Additionally, the harmonic distortion mentioned earlier can be seen in the kernels as well. The shapes of the kernels perpendicular to the diagonal have direct analogs in polynomials: on either side of the diagonal of figures 3a and 3b, the shape is reminiscent of the parabola of a quadratic
26

equation and the `s' shape of the cubic equation can be found on either side of the diagonal of figure 4. This bears a word of caution that not too much should be read into the shape itself of the kernels, as they are dictated by the form of the underlying polynomials.
[Figure 5 about here.]
Figure 5 highlights a central component of higher-order impulse responses: the break down of superposition or history dependence of the transfer function. The nonlinear impulse response to two shocks at different points in time is not equal to the sum of the individual responses, even after having corrected the individual responses for the higher order. The panels in the figure depict the second-order contributions to the impulse responses of capital, consumption, and labor to two positive, one standard deviation technology shocks, spaced 50 periods apart. The dashed line in the top of figure simply adds the individual second order components from each shock together (i.e., presents the total second-order component if superposition were to hold), whereas the solid line additionally contains the second-order cross-component (i.e., presents the true total second-order component). Demonstrating this breakdown of superposition, the cross component overwhelms the individual components shortly after the second shocks hits and the second-order contributions to the responses of capital (upper panel) and consumption (middle panel) fail to match the peak response from a single shock, despite the lingering contribution from the initial shock in the same direction. Although the mitigation is much less pronounced for labor (lower panel), the difference from the sum of individual contributions is nonetheless noticeable and prolonged. In a nonlinear environment, there is no single measure for an impulse response;25 in starting from the stochastic steady state, however, we remove any deterministic trends in our impulse response measure at each order of approximation (e.g., starting from the ergodic mean introduces such a trend, see footnote 21).

5 Accuracy

In this section, we explore the accuracy of our solution method using Euler equation error methods.26

Beside validating the accuracy of our solution method, we add an Euler equation error method

for assessing the accuracy of an impulse response, enabling the method to address our infinite-

dimensional state space.

We examine our method using the model of Aruoba, Ferna´ndez-Villaverde, and Rubio-Ram´irez

(2006), examined in section 4.2. From Judd (1992), the idea of the Euler equation accuracy test in the

neoclassical growth model is to find a unit-free measure that expresses the one-period optimization

error in relation to current consumption. Accordingly, (52) can be rearranged to deliver the Euler

equation error function as27

Deviations in (61) from zero are interpreted by Judd (1992) and many others as the relative opti-

mization error that results from using a particular approximation. Expressed in absolute value and

in base 10 logarithms, an error of -1 implies a one dollar error for every ten dollars spent and an error of -6 implies a one dollar error for every million dollars spent.
The arguments of EE () depend on the state space postulated. Standard state-space methods would choose EE (Kt-1, Zt) or EE (Kt-1, Zt-1, Z,t). Our nonlinear moving average policy function requires EE (Z,t, Z,t-1, . . .), rendering the Euler equation error function an infinite dimensional measure. In line with our presentation of impulse response functions, we examine the following set

of Euler equation error functions, holding all be one shock constant and moving back in time from t,

essentially assessing the one-step optimizing error associated with the impulse response functions.

(62) EEt = EE (Z,t, 0, 0, . . .) , EEt-1 = EE (0, Z,t-1, 0, . . .) , EEt-2 = EE (0, 0, Z,t-2, . . .) , . . .
26See, e.g., Judd (1992), Judd and Guu (1997), and Judd (1998) 27Cf. Aruoba, Ferna´ndez-Villaverde, and Rubio-Ram´irez (2006, p. 2499).

28

We examine a range of shock values for Z,t- j that covers 10 standard deviations in either direction. This is perhaps excessive given the assumption of normality, but enables us to cover the same range for the technology process examined in Aruoba, Ferna´ndez-Villaverde, and Rubio-Ram´irez (2006) from a single shock. Figure 6 plots EEt for first through third order approximations in logs, see section 4.2, and in the variables' original level specification. The first observation is that higher order in levels performs uniformly better than the preceding order--this result is reassuring, but not a given. As Lombardo (2010, p. 22) remarks, although within the radius of convergence the error in approximation goes to zero as the order of approximation becomes infinite, this does not necessary happen monotonically. Second, switching to a log specification improves the first and second order approximations uniformly, while for the third order, this is true only for very large shocks. If we restrict our attention to three standard deviation shocks (±0.021), the second order log approximation make mistakes no greater than one dollar for everyone ten million spent and the third order level and log approximations no greater than one dollar for everyone one hundred million spent, hardly an unreasonable error. Of independent interest is the result that the first order approximation in logs is uniformly superior to the first order approximation in levels, standing in contrast to the result of Aruoba, Ferna´ndez-Villaverde, and Rubio-Ram´irez (2006). As their focus was on the mapping from capital to errors and ours on shocks to errors, it is possible that the preferred approximation depends on the dimension under study.
[Figure 6 about here.]
In figure 7, plots of EEt- j for j = 0, 1, . . ., 100 for the first order approximations in both levels and logs are provided. Comparing these two figures--let alone incorporating the associated results for the second and third order (not pictured)--is difficult at best. Thus, to facilitate comparison of the different approximations across the different horizons, two measures that reduce to two dimensions will be examined, namely maximal and average Euler equation errors.
[Figure 7 about here.]
29

First, we plot the maximal Euler equation errors over a span of 100 periods in figure 8a. I.e., (63) max EEt- j , for j = 0, 1, . . ., 100
-10e<Z,t- j<10e
where e is the constant standard deviation of the technology shock. The figure tends to reinforce the results from examining only shocks in period t: for both the level and log approximations, moving to a higher order uniformly improves the quality of approximation and, at all three orders, moving from a level to a log specification likewise improves the accuracy of the approximation uniformly according to this metric.
[Figure 8 about here.]
In our final measure, we graph average Euler equation errors over a span of 100 periods in figure 8b. In contrast to state space analyses where the ergodic distribution of endogenous state variables is needed, this measure is relatively easy to calculate, as we merely need to integrate with respect to the known distribution (in this case normal) of the shocks (64) EEt- jdFZ,t-j , for j = 0, 1, . . . , 100 Weighting the regions of shock realizations most likely to be encountered as defined by the distribution of shocks, we are not forced to make a choice regarding the range of shock values to consider. Again, we note the uniform improvement with higher order for the level approximations and the improvement in the approximation by switching to logs. Though now there is some ambiguity regarding the preferred specification among the third in levels and second and third in logs, with the second order log specification surpassing both third order approximations between 25 and 35 quarters. The average error using a first order in level approximation is around one dollar for every ten thousand spent regardless of horizon. The second order approximations show an improvement as the horizon increases, whereas the third order approximations tend to be lower at first, rise and then fall again. The third order approximation in both levels and logs are associated with an average error of about one dollar for every billion spent regardless of horizon, putting the ambiguity mentioned above in perspective.
30

We conclude that the nonlinear moving average policy function can provide competitive approximations of the mapping from shocks to endogenous variables. As was the case with Aruoba, Ferna´ndez-Villaverde, and Rubio-Ram´irez (2006), however, the perturbation methods here deteriorate (not reported) in their extreme parameterization. As all perturbations, our method remains a local method and is subject to all the limitations and reservations that face such methods.
6 Conclusion
We have introduced a nonlinear infinite moving average as an alternative to the standard statespace policy function to the dynamical analysis of nonlinear DSGE models. We have derived an perturbation-based approximation of this policy function, providing explicit derivations up to third order in the form of a Volterra expansion. This approach for directly mapping the history of shocks into endogenous variables enables familiar impulse response analysis techniques in a nonlinear environment, and provides a convenient decomposition on the mapping from approximation order and uncertainty. We confirm that this approach provides a solution with a degree of accuracy comparable to state-space methods by introducing Euler equation error methods for this infinite dimensional mapping.
Although there are a number of DSGE models and applications, i.e., welfare analysis, asset pricing and stochastic volatility for which the importance of nonlinear components and uncertainty in the policy function has been proved, the nonlinear components we analyzed in the baseline neoclassical growth model are quantitatively unimportant, this is not surprising as the model is known to be nearly linear. Qualitatively, the nonlinear contributions to the the mapping from shocks to endogenous variables are economically interpretable, translating, e.g., into precautionary behavior and wealth effects. Likewise, non economically interpretable artifacts of the nonlinear method, such as harmonic distortion are documented as well.
The potential for explosive behavior in the simulation of state-space perturbations has lead to
31

the adaptation of `pruning' algorithms, see Kim, Kim, Schaumburg, and Sims (2008), that appear ad-hoc relative to the perturbation solution itself. With our method, however, the stability from the first order solution is passed on to all higher order recursions. This feature of the nonlinear kernels in our moving average solution is consistent with the Volterra operator acting upon the history of shocks being bounded and the existence of an endogenous, perturbation-based `pruning' algorithm derived from inverting our moving average, both of which we study in a companion paper.
The nonlinear perturbation DSGE literature is still in an early stage of development and our method provides a different, yet--from linear methods--familiar, perspective. Standard state-space perturbation methods provide insight into the nonlinear mapping between endogenous variables through time. Yet when the researcher's interest lies in examining the nonlinear mapping from exogenous shocks to endogenous variables, our method has considerable insight to offer.

a linear deterministic second order difference equation in the third derivative yk, j,i. The homogeneous components in (A-17) are identical to those in (16) and (25). The inhomogeneous components

again have a first order Markov representation. Using the shifting and transition matrices defined in

appendix A.2 gives (39) of the main text, whose solution takes the form (40). The solution of the

forgoing, analogously to lower orders, takes the form. By recursively substituting (40) in (A-17), using the shifting matrices and matching coefficients, we obtain a Sylvester equation28 in 3

(A-18)

( fy + fy+ )3 + fy+ 33 = - fx3 fx2 fx2 fx2 3

Now we move on to the partial derivatives of y function involving the perturbation parameter .

To determine y, j,i, we differentiate f with respect to t-i, t- j and

where Dx j,i = x, j,i + x, j,i(t+1  Ine2 )

Evaluating at y, taking expectations, setting the resulting expression to zero yields, and noting the

results from lower orders yields the expression in the text, whose solution, again analogously to

lower orders, takes the form y, j,i = y, j-1,i-1, with y, j,i = 0, for j, i < 0 delivering (42) in the main text.

To determine y2,i, we differentiate f with respect to t-i and  twice
D32tT-i f = fx3 (DxDx  xi) + fx2 (Dx  Dxi) + fx2(D22 x  xi) + fx2 (Dx  Dxi) + fxD22xi
28 It is a straightforward exntension of Lan and Meyer-Gohde (2011) to shown the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the Sylvester equation is guaranteed by the saddle point assumption.

Evaluating at the nonstochastic steady state (y), taking expectations, and setting the resulting ex-

pression to zero yields the expression in the main text, which is still a second order deterministic

difference equation. The homogeneous components are packed in x2,i, and they are identical to those in (16) and (25). The inhomogeneous components can again be rearranged to have a first order

Markov representation by using the shifting and transition matrices defined in appendix A.2, thus

The solution of the forgoing takes the form of (44) in the main text Substituting (44) in (A-21) and matching coefficients, we obtain a Sylvester equation29 in  (A-22)
( fy + fy+) + fy+1 = - fx3(41  41  1) + fx2 ([42(S0  S0)]  1)

+ 2 fx2 (41  [42(S0  1)]) + fx435(S0  S0  1) [Et(t+1  t+1)  Ine] + fx2(x2  1)

To determine y3, we differentiate f with respect to  three times

(A-23)

D33 f = fx3(Dx  Dx  Dx) + 2 fx2 (Dx  D22 x) + fx2 (D22x  Dx) + fxD33x

where D33x = x3 + 3x2,t+1 + 3x,2(t+1  t+1) + x3(t+1  t+1  t+1)

Evaluating this at the nonstochastic steady state and setting its expectation to zero yields

Et (D33 f ) x = fx3 [(x  x  x)Et (t+1  t+1  t+1)] + 2 fx2[Et(t+1  t+1  t+1)(x  x2 )] + fx2 [(x2  x)Et (t+1  t+1  t+1)] + fx[y3 + x3Et (t+1  t+1  t+1)]

(A-24)

=0

the expression in the text.

29The existence and uniqueness of the solution to the Sylvester equation is guaranteed, see footnote 28.
