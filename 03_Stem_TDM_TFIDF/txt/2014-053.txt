IMPROVED VOLATILITY ESTIMATION BASED ON LIMIT ORDER BOOKS 
By Markus Bibinger, Moritz Jirak, Markus Reiß
Humboldt-Universit¨at zu Berlin
For a semi-martingale Xt, which forms a stochastic boundary, a rate-optimal estimator for its quadratic variation X, X t is constructed based on observations in the vicinity of Xt. The problem is embedded in a Poisson point process framework, which reveals an interesting connection to the theory of Brownian excursion areas. A major application is the estimation of the integrated squared volatility of an efficient price process Xt from intra-day order book quotes. We derive n-1/3 as optimal convergence rate of integrated squared volatility estimation in a high-frequency framework with n observations (in mean). This considerably improves upon the classical n-1/4-rate obtained from transaction prices under microstructure noise.

1. Introduction. Consider observations (Yi) above a stochastic boundary (Xt, t  [0, 1]), which is formed by the graph of a continuous semimartingale. The objective is to optimally recover the driving characteristic X, X t of the boundary Xt, given the observations (Yi). Such (stochastic) frontier models naturally arise in many applications and a quantification of the information content in these observations is non-trivial. We formulate the problem with an emphasis on the financial context of limit order books. From a microeconomic point of view ask prices will always lie above the efficient market price. Here the underlying latent efficient log-price of a stock (Xt, t  [0, 1]), observed over a trading period like a day, serves as the boundary, whereas ask prices form the observations (Yi). Bid prices can be handled symmetrically and independently, which can be used to validate the model.

natural continuous-time embedding of the boundary problem is in terms of

a Poisson point process (PPP). Conditional on (Xt, t  [0, 1]) we observe a PPP on [0, 1] × R with intensity measure

We denote by (Tj, Yj) the observations of that point process, which are homogeneously dispersed above the graph of (Xt, t  [0, 1]). Theoretically and also intuitively, information on the stochastic boundary can only be recovered from the lowest observation points and a homogeneous intensity away from the boundary is assumed for convenience only.
An associated discrete-time regression-type model, which explains well the difference to regular microstructure noise models, is defined by

(1.3)

with observation times tin and an error distribution function F satisfying

F(x) = x 1 + O(1) , as x  0.

One natural parametric specification is i  Exp(). The noise is assumed to be independent of the signal part X. In microstructure noise models for transaction prices it is usually assumed that E[i] = 0 holds, while here Xtni

defines the boundary of the support measure for Yi, which we may interpret as best ask price at time tin. In fact, if the boundary function was piecewise
constant, then by standard PPP properties we would obtain the regression-

type model (1.3) with exponential noise from the PPP-model (1.2) by taking

local minima (on those pieces). Here we show that under so called high-

frequency asymptotics, the fundamental quantities in both models exhibit

the same asymptotic behaviour, see Proposition 3.2 below. Compare also [17]

for the stronger Le Cam ­ equivalence in the case of smoother boundaries.

Both observation models are illustrated in Figure 1.

Mostly, we shall concentrate on the more universal PPP model which also

allows for simpler scaling and geometric interpretation. Local minima mn,k of Yj for Tj in some small interval [khn, (k + 1)hn)  [0, 1] will form the basic quantities to recover the boundary, which by PPP properties leads to

where A+ = max(A, 0), and its associated moments. For the fundamental case Xt = Wt, this opens an interesting connection to the theory of Brownian excursion areas and also reveals the difficulty of this problem. It is well documented in the literature, see e.g. [16], that no explicit form of the expectation in the expression above is available. Essentially only (double) Laplace transforms and related quantities are known, cf. Proposition 3.3 below and the attached discussion. This makes the recovery of X, X 1 an intricate probabilistic question. Still, we are able to prove that our estimator attains the improved rate n-1/3, compared to regular microstructure noise models. What is more, by information-theoretic arguments we are able to derive a lower bound showing that the n-1/3-rate is indeed minimax optimal. A more direct proof seems out of reach because the Poisson part from the noise intertwines with the Gaussian martingale part in a way which renders the likelihood and respective Hellinger distances difficult to control, even asymptotically.
The growing finance literature on limit order books so far focusses on modeling and empirical studies. Empirical contributions as [4], [6] and [18] have investigated price and volume distribution, inter-event durations as well as the structure of the order-flow. Probabilistic models proposed for a limit order book include point process models, see [9], [2] and [15], with mutually exciting processes. Other models come from queuing theory, for instance [11], [24] and [10], or stochastic optimal control theory as [7]. The main objective of most modeling approaches is to explain how market prices arise from the

book. For the financial application, this papers adopts a new course. It is the first work, to the best of our knowledge, with the focus on statistical inference for the volatility based on observations from a limit order book. We have already highlighted the relationship of the suggested model to the regular microstructure noise model which constitutes the standard setup for developing volatility estimators. Let us mention the work by [1], [27], taken up by [3] and [14], among many others, who describe high-frequency intraday trading prices as convolution of discretized observations of the efficient log-price with additive observation noise ascribed to market microstructure. The optimal convergence rate for volatility estimation in this model with Gaussian noise and n observations on an equidistant grid is n-1/4, see [13]. Recently, as information from order books become more and more available, researchers and practitioners have sparked the discussion to which kind of observed prices estimation methods should be applied. [12] discuss this point and the possibilities of mid-quotes, executed traded prices or micro-prices which are volume-weighted combinations of bid and ask order levels. None of these observed time series, however, is free from market microstructure corruptions and the idea of an underlying efficient price remains untouched. Figure 2 visualizes the information about the evolution of prices provided by a limit order book for one specific data set. The colored areas highlight differences between the five best bid and five best ask levels, the dark area in the center marking the bid-ask spread between best bid and best ask.

The idea is that an efficient price must always lie below the best ask (and symmetrically above the best bid) and that its distance to this stochastic frontier is homogeneous.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present an estimation approach based on local order statistics whose asymptotic properties are explored in Section 3. In Section 4 we prove the lower bound for the minimax estimation rate. Section 5 concludes. Proofs are provided in the Appendix.

2. Volatility estimation based on local minima. We construct the
integrated volatility estimator in both models (1.2) and (1.3). We partition the unit interval into h-n 1  N equi-spaced bins Tkn = [khn, (k + 1)hn), k = 0, . . . , hn-1 - 1, with bin-widths hn. For simplicity suppose that nhn  N. As n   the bin-width gets smaller hn  0, whereas the number of observed values on each bin gets large, nhn  . If we think of a constant signal locally on a bin observed with one-sided positive errors, classical parametric
estimation theory motivates to use the bin-wise minimum as an estimator of
the local signal (it then forms a sufficient statistic under exponential noise
or equivalently in the PPP model). In the regression-type model (1.3) with equidistant observation times tin = i/n, we therefore set

Equally, in the PPP model (1.2) the local minima are given by

Tkn = [khn, (k + 1)hn) .

The same symbol mn,k is used in both models because the following con-

struction only depends on the mn,k. All results and proofs will refer to the

concrete model under consideration.

Since Var(mn,k | (Xt))  (nhn)-2 holds in both models, the variance is

much smaller than for an estimator based on a local mean. Nevertheless,

we may continue in the spirit of the pre-averaging paradigm, cf. [14], and

interpret mn,k as a proxy for Xt on Tkn, which in a second step is inserted in

the realized variance expression

The

use of a locally constant signal approximation Xt = Xkhn + OP(hn1/2) on Tkn

is only admissible, however, if hn is chosen so small that hn1/2 = o((nhn)-1),

which would result in a sub-optimal procedure.

Rate-optimality can be attained if we balance the magnitude (nhn)-1 of bin-wise minimal errors due to noise with the range hn1/2 of the motion of

In the PPP model (1.2) this natural choice of the bin-width also follows nicely by a scaling argument: W¯ t = hn-1/2Whnt defines a standard Brownian motion for t  [0, 1] based on the values of W on [0, hn]; the correspondingly scaled PPP observations (T¯j, Y¯j) with T¯j = h-n 1Tj, Y¯j = hn-1/2Yj have an
intensity with density ¯t,y = nhn3/21(y  W¯ t), which becomes independent
of n exactly for hn = (n)-2/3.
In this balanced setup the law of the statistics mn,k depends on the motion
of X as well as the error distribution in a non-trivial way. Still, the natural
statistics to assess the quadratic variation of the boundary process X are the squared differences (mn,k - mn,k-1)2 between consecutive local minima.
In the PPP model and with the choice

Below we shall derive theoretical properties of  and in particular we shall see that it is invertible as soon as K > 0 is chosen sufficiently large. Numerically, the function  can be determined by standard Monte Carlo simulations, see Figure 3, and is thus available. This paves the way for a momentestimator approach. In fact, k(mn,2k - mn,2k-1)2 approximates (t2)dt

3. The law of local minima and the convergence rate of the estimator. In order to centralise the local minima, we write

(3.1)

mn,k - mn,k-1 = Rn,k - Ln,k , k = 1, . . . , hn-1 - 1 ,

where Rn,k = mn,k - Xkhn and Ln,k = mn,k-1 - Xkhn measure the distances between the minima on bin Tkn and Tkn-1, respectively, to the cen-
tral true value Xkhn between both bins. In our high-frequency framework

the drift is asymptotically negligible and a regular volatility function will
be approximated by a piecewise constant function on blocks of the coarse grid. In this setting, where Xt = Xkhn + (Wt - Wkhn), we may invoke time-reversibility of Brownian motion to see that Xt - Xkhn, t  Tkn-1, and Xt - Xkhn, t  Tkn, form independent Brownian motions of variance 2 such that Rn,k, Ln,k, k = (l - 1)rn-1 + 1, . . . , lrn-1, are all identically distributed and there is independence whenever different bins are considered (but Rn,k and Ln,k+1 are dependent). From (2.5) and (3.1) we infer
(k2hn )hn = E[Rn2,k] + E[L2n,k] - 2E[Rn,k]E[Ln,k] = 2 Var(Rn,k),
and similarly for n. The histogram in Figure 4 shows the distribution of Rn,k (equivalently Ln,k) in the regression model jointly with the associated histograms for miniIkn Xtin -Xkhn and miniIkn i. In this situation the law of Rn,k is given as the convolution between an exponential distribution and the law of the minimum of Brownian motion on the discrete grid Ikn. The latter converges to the law of the minimum of W on [0, 1], but the simulations
confirm the known feature that the laws deviate rather strongly around zero
for moderate discretisations. Let us state and prove a slightly more general
result.

Noting that W¯ s = h-n 1/2(W(k+s)hn - Wkhn), s  [0, 1], is again a Brownian motion, the result follows by rescaling and taking expectations.

For the regression-type model the survival function is asymptotically of the same form.

The approximation error due to non-constant  and drift is considered in detail in Appendix A.1 and proved to be asymptotically negligible. This way, the asymptotic analysis of our estimation problem leads into the theory of Brownian excursion areas. Let Rt be a real random variable distributed as limn hn-1/2Rn, th-n 1 . The law of Rt determines (t2) via

The Feynman­Kac formula gives a connection of the right-hand side in Proposition (3.1) to a parabolic PDE based on the heat semigroup for Brownian motion. We can prove the following explicit result on the Laplace transform which determines the distribution of (Rt), t  [0, 1].

This result generalizes the Laplace transform of the exponential integrated positive part of a Brownian motion derived by [22]. Inserting x = 0 and setting  = 1 renders the result by [22]. An inversion of the Laplace transform in Proposition 3.3 in order to obtain an explicit form of the distribution function and then  appears unfeasible as several experts vainly attempted to solve related problems, see [22] and [16]. Exploiting the strong Markov property of Brownian motion together with hitting times, we are able to circumvent this problem in our study of (2), for details we refer to the Appendix.
We formulate now the main convergence results whose proofs are given in the Appendix. For that we impose some regularity on the drift and diffusion coefficient which are also assumed to be deterministic or more generally independent of the driving Brownian motion W . Moreover, we need that the function  is invertible and sufficiently regular, which by Proposition A.2 below is ensured by a sufficiently large choice of K, but at least numerically seems to be the case for much smaller choices, cf. Figure 3 and [5].

Assumption 3.4. The drift as in (1.1) is bounded and Borel-measurable, the volatility t in (1.1) is a Lipschitz function that does not vanish, t > 0. The constant K in the definition (2.4) of hn is chosen large enough that Proposition A.2 below applies.

4. Lower bound for the rate of convergence. Consider our PPP-
model (1.2). We show that even in the simpler parametric statistical experiment where Xt = Wt, t  [0, 1], and  > 0 is unknown the optimal rate of convergence is n-1/3 in a minimax sense. This lower bound for the paramet-
ric case then serves a fortiori as a lower bound for the general nonparametric
case. A lower bound for the discrete regression-type model is obtained in a
similar way; in fact the proof is even simpler, replacing the Poisson sampling (Tjs) below by a deterministic design of distance n-2/3.

where the infimum extends over all estimators ^n based on the PPP-model (1.2) with  = 1 and Xt = Wt. The law of the latter is denoted by P2.

The proof falls into three main parts. We first simplify the problem by considering more informative experiments. These reductions are given in the two steps below. Then, in the third step we use bounds for the Hellinger distance. The more technical step 3 is worked out in Appendix B.
1. A PPP with intensity  is obtained as the sum of two independent PPPs with intensities r and s, respectively, satisfying  = r + s,

12 M. BIBINGER, M. JIRAK & M. REISS

see e.g. [20]. Hence, for b > 0 the experiment of observing (Tir, Yir)i1 from a PPP with regularised intensity density

and independently (Tjs, Yjs)j1 from a PPP with discontinuous intensity density s =  - r is more informative. We now provide even more information by replacing (Tjs, Yjs)j1 by (Tjs, XTjs)j1, the direct observation of the martingale values at the random times (Tjs). A lower bound proved for observing (Tir, Yir)i1 and (Tjs, XTjs)j1 independently thus also applies to the original (less informative) observa-
tions. 2. Due to s(t, y)dt dy = (2/3)nb, we conclude that the times (Tjs) are
given by a Poisson sampling of intensity (2/3)nb on [0, 1] and there are a.s. only finitely many times (Tjs)j=1,...,J . Let us first work conditionally on (Tjs) and put T0s = 0, TJs+1 = 1. All observations of (Tir, Yir)i1 with Tir  [Tjs-1, Tjs) are transformed via

(Tir, Yir) 

Tir - Tjs-1, Yir -

.

Noting that (Bt - (t/T )BT , t  [0, T ]) defines a Brownian bridge B0,T on [0, T ], we thus obtain conditionally on (Tjs) for each j = 1, . . . , J +1 observations of a PPP on 0, Tjs - Tjs-1 with intensity density

The transformation has rendered the family of PPPs with intensity densities (j)j=1,...,J+1 independent by reducing the Brownian motion to piecewise Brownian bridges. Conditionally on (Tjs) we thus have independent observations of (Tjs, XTjs)j=1,...,J and independent PPPs with intensity densities (j)j=1,...,J+1.
By using the latter more informative experiment and by choosing b  n-1/3 we show below that for a Poisson sampling (Tjs)j=1,...,J on [0, 1] of intensity (2/3)nb  n2/3 of direct observations XTjs as well as for independent observations of PPPs, generated by  times a Brownian bridge in-between the sampling points (Tjs)j, we cannot estimate at a better rate than n-1/3. This is accomplished by bounding the Hellinger distance between the experiments for 2 = 02 and 2 = 02 + n-1/3.

5. Conclusion. We have modeled the relationship between limit order book bid and ask quotes and an efficient price process by a stochastic frontier model. The model does not attempt to describe the fine structure of order book dynamics, but is only based on the natural ordering between quotes and prices. This agnostic point of view seems attractive for statistical purposes. Still, we find n-1/3 as optimal convergence rate of integrated squared volatility estimators which improves upon the n-1/4-rate, known for transaction price models with regular microstructure noise.
The estimation approach uses local order statistics and a coarse-fine grid approximation whose analysis is connected to a Brownian excursion problem. Owing to the nonlinear and implicit definition, finer properties of the estimator like its asymptotic distribution remain open. First numerical results in [5] are in any case promising. An empirical validation, using the three data sets of bid and ask quotes and transaction prices independently, is feasible.

Proof of Proposition 3.2. By law invariance of Rn,k with respect to k for Xt = X0 + Wt, we can simplify

P(h-n 1/2Rn,k > x) = P

,

where we used that h1n/2Wt/hn is another Brownian motion. We condition on the driving Brownian motion W = (Wt, t  [0, 1]) and obtain in terms of
the distribution function F of i:

P(hn-1/2Rn,k > x) = E

nhn-1  P i > hn1/2(x - Wi/(nhn))

 W

i=0

nhn-1

= E exp

log 1 - F(hn1/2(x - Wi/(nhn)))

i=0

.

14 M. BIBINGER, M. JIRAK & M. REISS

The expansion (1.4) of F together with expanding the logarithm therefore yields

nhn-1

P(hn-1/2Rn,k > x) = E exp - hn1/2

(x - Wi/(nhn))+(1 + O(1)) ,

i=0

where O(1) is to be understood -wise and holds uniformly over i and n

whenever maxt[0,1](x - Wt())+ is bounded. By the choice of hn we have

h1n/2 = K(nhn)-1 and the integrand is a Riemann sum tending almost

surely to exp(-K

1 0

(x

-

Wt)+dt).

Noting

that

a

conditional

probability

is

always bounded by 1, the assertion follows by dominated convergence and

use of -W =d W .

Proof of Proposition 3.3. Throughout the proof, we drop the dependence on  in s(x, ), s,-(x, ) and s,+(x, ) to lighten the notation. We shall apply the Kac formula in the version as in formulae (4.13) and (4.14) of [19]. It connects the considered Laplace transform with the solution of a differential equation which becomes in our case:

(A.1a) (A.1b)

d2 dx2

=

2s

- 22/3

d2 dx2

=

 2( 2x + s)

- 22/3

, x < 0, , x > 0.

Since all assertions necessary to apply the Kac formula are fulfilled, the

Laplace transform from above multiplied with a constant Lagrangian 2/3

satisfies



t



E 2/3 exp - st - 2 (x + Ws)+ ds dt = s(x) .

00

The general solution of (A.1a) is given by

(A.2a)

  s,-(x) = A exp 2sx + 2/3s-1 ,

with a constant A (depending on s but not on x). Airy's function Ai solves the homogenous differential equation of the type (A.1b), whereas the Scorer function Gi is a particular solution of the inhomogenous equation  - x = -1, both being bounded on the positive real line. Hence, a solution ansatz for (A.1b) is given by
    (A.2b) s,+(x) = BAi 21/3x + -2/3s + Gi 21/3x + -2/3s ,

15

with a constant B. Continuity conditions on  and d/dx at x = 0 give rise

to

  1/3Gi

 -2/3s

-

sGi-2/3

 s

+

2/3s-1/2

B=

sAi-2/3

 s

-

1/3Ai

 -2/3s

.

In order to express A in a more concise and simple manner, we exploit the following relation for the Wronskian of Ai and Gi:

(A.3)


 Gi (x)Ai(x) - Ai (x)Gi(x) = AI(x) = Ai(y) dy .
x

A proof of the latter equality can be found in [26]. Thereby, we obtain









A=

2/3s-1/2Ai -2/3s + 1/3AI -2/3s

sAi-2/3s

- 1/3Ai

 -2/3s

- s-12/3

.

This result concludes the proof.

A.1. Asymptotic analysis of the estimator. As a first step, we extend Proposition 3.1 by analysing the approximation error due to neglecting the drift and assuming a locally constant volatility. Then we prove Theorem 3.5 exploiting properties of  which are established in Appendix A.2.

Proposition A.1. Consider hn in (2.4) and t  Tkn for fixed k. Then

Then we have the upper and lower bounds

By scaling and symmetry properties of Brownian motion, we have that

(x + Wt)+dt = Kkhn

(Wt + x)+ dt.

As a first objective, we derive an upper bound for E exp - yTk , y > 0. To this end, note that by the Dambis-Dubins-Schwarz Theorem (Thm. 4.6 in [19])

Xt(k) =d W X(k),X(k) t .

Since

X(k), X(k) t =

t khn

for

deduce

with some C > 0. By the boundedness of at, it follows that

We thus obtain for y > 0 the upper bound

(A.6)

+ exp - C1xynhnkhn /2 + C2yn-1/3 ,

where C1, C2 > 0 are finite constants. This also supplies a bound for E[exp(-yVk)]. Next, observe that

Uk  nhn sup

Using the law of the maximum of (time-transformed) Brownian motion, we

By the Lipschitz property of t, the integral is of order hn3 . We obtain by Cauchy-Schwarz inequality

In the same manner, one obtains a lower bound, and the claim follows.

The choice l = (K)-2/3 and division by  yield the claim.

Proof of Lemma A.8. Without loss of generality, we may assume that

K= 1. From the considerations below, existence of the k'th derivative of

APPENDIX B: PROOF OF THEOREM 2

After the reductions of the problem to a simpler and more informative
experiment, we now prove Theorem 4.1 using properties of the Hellinger distance H(P, Q) between probability measures, in particular H2(P1  P2, Q1Q2)  H2(P1, Q1)+H2(P2, Q2) (subadditivity under independence), H2(P, Q) = E[H2(P, Q|T )] (Hellinger distance conditional on a statistic T )
and
H2(P P P (1), P P P (2))  ( 1 - 2)2

(Hellinger bound for PPP measures with intensity densities i, cf. [21]). Put n = 05/3n-1/3. From H2(N (0, 02), N (0, 02 + n))  2(n0-2)2,
cf. Appendix in [23], and the independent increments of Brownian motion
we infer for the Hellinger distance of the laws of (XTjs)j=1,...,J under 02 and 02 + n

For each PPP with intensity density j we obtain by integral calculations, in terms of  = (02 + n)1/2 - 0:

H2 P P P (j (02)), P P P (j (02 + n)) (Tjs), B0,Tjs-Tjs-1

Since conditional on (Tjs) all observations are independent, the total squared Hellinger distance conditional on (Tjs) is bounded by

Taking expectations and using J  Poiss(2nb/3), Tjs-Tjs-1  Exp(2nb/3) to apply the Wald identity to the second sum, the unconditional total Hellinger
distance is bounded by

H2
