Abstract
Empirical studies have shown that a large number of financial asset returns exhibit fat tails and are often characterized by volatility clustering and asymmetry. Also revealed as a stylized fact is Long memory or long range dependence in market volatility, with significant impact on pricing and forecasting of market volatility. The implication is that models that accomodate long memory hold the promise of improved long-run volatility forecast as well as accurate pricing of long-term contracts. On the other hand, recent focus is on whether long memory can affect the measurement of market risk in the context of Value-atRisk (V aR). In this paper, we evaluate the Value-at-Risk (V aR) and Expected Shortfall (ESF ) in financial markets under such conditions. We examine one equity portfolio, the British F T SE100 and three stocks of the German DAX index portfolio (Bayer, Siemens and Volkswagen). Classical V aR estimation methodology such as exponential moving average (EM A) as well as extension to cases where long memory is an inherent characteristics of the system are investigated. In particular, we estimate two long memory models, the Fractional Integrated Asymmetric Power-ARCH and the Hyperbolic-GARCH with different error distribution assumptions. Our results show that models that account for asymmetries in the volatility specifications as well as fractional integrated parametrization of the volatility process, perform better in predicting the one-step as well as five-step ahead V aR and ESF for short and long positions than short memory models. This suggests that for proper risk valuation of options, the degree of persistence should be investigated and appropriate models that incorporate the existence of such characteristic be taken into account.

1 Introduction
Empirical studies have shown that a large number of financial asset returns exhibit fat tails (leptokurtosis) and are often characterized by volatility clustering (large changes that tend to be followed by large changes and vice versa), leverage effects (changes in stock prices that tend to be negatively correlated with changes in volatility) as well as long range dependence (signs of dependence between far apart observations in a given time series). Ding et al. (1993), So (2000), Henry (2002), Aloui et al. (2005) have found that financial assets may exhibit long range dependence on stock market volatility. Bollerslev and Mikkelsen (1996), Herzberg and Sibbertsen (2004) have shown that such long term dependence has significant impact on the pricing of financial derivatives as well as forecasting market volatility. This may in turn affect an investment portfolio, bringing about huge losses or gains.
An important part of modern financial risk management is the measuring and forecasting portfolio risk and fluctuations due to changing market and/ or portfolio shares. A number of applications of Value-at-risk (V aR) on financial asset returns have shown that due to excess kurtosis, estimation under the assumption of normally distributed residuals tend to underestimate or overestimate the true V aR. Brooks and Persand (2003a) showed that models that do not allow for asymmetries in the unconditional distribution or volatility specification, underestimate the true V aR and are most likely to generate inaccurate forecasts. Giot and Laurent (2004) pointed out that the V aR for daily stock indexes with a skewed student-t distribution performed better than with pure symmetric distribution.
On the other hand, studies on whether long memory phenomena can affect the measurement of market risk in the context of value-at-risk (V aR) is a topic of interest. In this paper, we focus on financial market risk which refers to the risk that arises due to unforeseen movements in markets price (e.g. equity or option prices) or market rates (e.g. interest or exchange rates). We examine one equity portfolio, the British F T SE100 and three stocks of the German DAX index portfolio (Bayer, Siemens and Volkswagen). In addition to applying classical risk estimation methodology such as the exponential moving average (EM A) and the empirical distribution function (EDF ), our

focus is on risk evaluation in the case where long memory is an inherent characteristics of the system. Figure 1 shows a time plot of V aR forecasts using the exponential moving average (EM A) method (with decay factor,  = 0.94 and a rolling window of 250 days) and the empirical distribution function (EDF ) method on Volkswagen log-returns from 3rd January 2000 10th October 2006. The significance level under consideration is 1% for large losses and 99% for large profits. Returns which exceed the V aR are marked in red. Though the EM A method shows better forecast result than the (EDF ), the poor forecast quality of these methods are reflected by the number of V aR exceeded. This indicates a possible inadequacy of an assumed normal distribution. Guermat and Harris (2002) have shown that the EM A-based V aR forecasts are excessively volatile and unnecessarily high, when returns are not conditionally normal.
In what follows, we focus on risk evaluation under long range depen-

dence in the volatility process. In particular, we apply two long memory in volatility models, the Fractional Integrated Asymmetric Power-ARCH (F IAP ARCH) and the Hyperbolic-GARCH (HY GARCH) with different error distribution assumptions. Our results show that models that account for asymmetries in the volatility specifications as well as fractional integrated parametrization of the volatility process, perform better in predicting the one-step as well as five-step ahead V aR and ESF for short and long positions than short memory models. For example, results for the DAX stocks suggest that accurate V aR estimates may be obtained from a long memory in volatility model, coupled with skewed Student-t distributed innovations. This indicates that for proper risk valuation of these stocks, the degree of persistence should be investigated and appropriate models that incorporate the existence of such characteristic be taken into account.

Measuring financial market risk can be described by the V aR, which estimates the probability of a portfolio of assets losing a specific amount over a specified time period due to adverse movements in the underlying market factors, Jorion (2001).

Let S1, . . . , Sn be a time series of stock's prices. For the price series

St (t = 1, . . . , n), daily logarithmic return (log-return) is defined as rt =

log

St St-1

. The loss that rt could incur over a given time horizon h with a

given confidence level 1 - , at time t conditionally on available information,

Ft-1 is defined by the V aR:

P {(rt  V aRt,h()|Ft-1} = .

V aR can also be defined from the distribution of log-returns, Jorion (2001). If q is the th percentile of continuously compounded return rt, then the h-step ahead V aR in time t is defined as
V aRt,h() = (1 - eq)St-h.
This definition shows that a good V aR estimate can be realized with accurate forecasts of the percentiles q, which depends on appropriate volatility modelling. V aR can describe extreme events, but it can not aggregate risk

5

in the sense of subadditivity on portfolios (in this case, risk is diversified). This recognized shortcoming is addressed by the concept of expected shortfall (ESF ), a "coherent risk measure" in the sense of Artzner et al. (1999).
The ESF is a coherent measure for such risk, used to predict the expected value of the loss given that the loss is greater than the V aR, Scaillet (2004).
ESFt = E(|Lt| > |V aRt|),
where Lt is the expected value of loss if a V aRt violation occurs. An equivalent measure is the average multiple of tail event to risk (AM T ERM ), that "measures how much events in tail distribution exceed the V aR, by calculating the average multiple of these outcomes to their corresponding V aR measures", Hendricks (1996).
In our application, we estimate simultaneously V aR and ESF for the long and short positions. We apply long memory in volatility models using Student-t and skewed student-t distribution assumptions to find out which model has the best overall performance. Without including all long memory GARCH-type specification models available in the literature, we estimate only models that are extensions of specifications implemented in similar studies. We employ evaluation by backtesting procedure to investigate and select models that predict the V aR accurately and minimizes, if a V aR violation occurs.
In this regard, using daily returns, we analyze a V aR and ESF for daily trading portfolios made up of long, (V aRL) and short, (V aRS) positions, using various long-memory GARCH-type models. At long position, traders incur losses when drop in stock prices (negative returns) are observed as opposed to short position where losses are incurred when increase in stock prices (positive returns) are observed.
Our analysis is twofold; first, we test and estimate long range dependence in the return indexes by employing the rescaled variance test, Geweke and Porter-Hudak (1983) (GP H) and two estimators, the log-periodogram regression (GP H), Geweke and Porter-Hudak (1983) and the Gaussian semiparametric (GSP ), Robinson (1995a) estimators. We then model long range dependence by fitting GARCH-type models that are known to accommo-
6

date distributional characteristics such as volatility clustering, asymmetry, leptokurtosis as well as long memory. This includes the (HY GARCH), Davidson (2004) model that can well accommodate long memory and the (F IAP ARCH), Tse (1998) that can accommodate both asymmetry and long memory.
Second, we assume that investors in today's financial market can invest by holding not only long but short positions. We compute the V aR and ESF for both positions based on the chosen models. Our results suggest that accurate V aR estimates may be obtained from a long memory in volatility model, coupled with skewed Student-t distributed innovations. Although these models can achieve accurate V aR and ESF for insample one-step ahead prediction, we find that models that account for asymmetries as well as fractional integrated parametrization of the volatility process, perform better than those that reflect only symmetry or long-memory. This confirms, the findings of Angelidis and Degiannakis (2006), in suggesting that models with fractional integration parametrization of the volatility process are necessary for accurate assessment of market risk. Long- memory in volatility models hold the promise of improved long-run volatility forecast and more accurate pricing of long-term contracts. The implication can therefore be extended to the context of risk management.
An outline of the remaining sections of this paper is as follows. In section 2 we characterize the long memory models used and their specifications. Section 3 present and overview on Backtesting V aR valuation methods. In section 4 we present our empirical application and results.

2 Long Memory Models Specifications

We consider the continuously compounded rate of returns of a stock index,

rt = log

St St-1

(St is the stock price at time t) from time t - 1 to t, which

can be decomposed into a predictable component, µt and an unpredictable

7

component, t, that:

rt = µt + t, t = ztt

(1) (2)

Following Bollerslev (1986), the GARCH(p, q) model for conditional variance

is specified as

qp
t2 =  + i2t-i + j2t-j
i=1 j=1

(3)

where  > 0, i  0 for i = 1, . . . , q and j  0 for j = 1, . . . , p. In the case

where

q i=1

A shock to t2 is known to have decaying impact on future volatility, t2+h, for increasing h, but is asymptotically negligible. Many high-frequency times

series applications that have employed GARCH(p, q) process to estimate t2,

show strong dependence in that

In the framework of risk management, the application of the GARCH(1, 1)

model to forecast investors risk have yield mixed results. Billo and Pelizzon

(2000) have shown that for V aR valuation, the number of exceptions gener-

ated by the GARCH(1, 1) model deviates significantly from the theoretical

values. Using lag-operator L, equation (3) can be expressed as an ARM A

process:

[1 - (L) - (L)]2t =  + [1 - (L)](2t - t2)

where (L) = 1(L) + · · · + qLq and (L) = 1(L) + · · · + pLp.

For (L)+(L) = 1, Engel and Bollerslev (1986) proposed the IntegratedGARCH, IGARCH(p, q) model, expressed as

(L)(1 - L)2t =  + [1 - (L)](2t - t2)

(4)

where (L) = [1-(L)-(L)](1-L)-1, is of order max(p, q)-1. Compared

8

to GARCH(p, q), the t2 in IGARCH(p, q) is infinite and a shock to t2 is persistent, indicating its importance for volatility forecasting. A special case of the IGARCH(p, q) is the Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EW M A) model or RiskMetrics, expressed as

t2 = (1 - )2t-1 + t2-1

(5)

where  = 0.94 for daily and  = 0.97 for weekly data respectively. In this case the ARCH and GARCH coefficients are fixed. This model process provides a cumulative impulse response function that is constant over time, which is not very reliable. So and Yu (2006) have shown that for the 99% V aR valuation, the EW M A model is outperformed by stationary and fractionally integrated GARCH models.

Between stationarity and unit root, the concept of fractional integration has been extended to GARCH type models, with many ways to parametrisize the conditional volatility. In our application, we consider two long memory in volatility models, the F IAP ARCH of Tse (1998) and the HY GARCH of Davidson (2004).

FIAPARCH Model Tse (1998) introduced this model by incorporating a fractional filter (1 - L)d into the Asymmetric Power ARCH (AP ARCH) model frame work of Ding et al. (1993). The AP ARCH(p, q) can be expressed as

qp
t =  + i(|t-i| - it-i) + jt-j,
i=1 j=1

(6)

where  > 0 and -1 < i < 1.  represent a Box-Cox transformation of t and i the leverage effect. For the F IAP ARCH(p, d, q) model of Tse (1998), the conditional volatility specification is given as

t =  + 1 - [1 - (L)]-1(L)(1 - L)d (|t| - t).

C k2d-1

If k is large, the coefficients in equation (8) for (0 < d < 1) decay hyperbolically. Therefore the effect of past innovations on current conditional variance dies out at a hyperbolic rate with increasing lag length.
The term (|t| - t) reflects "leverage" effect,  = 0. When 0 <  < 1, a positive innovation increases volatility less than a negative innovation and vice versa for -1 <  < 0. For  = 0, positive and negative innovations of same magnitude have thesame effect on volatility. The F IAP ARCH model allows for volatility clustering, leptokurtosis, long memory and features asymmetry in relationship between the conditional variance and the lagged squared innovations. It nests the GARCH, IGARCH, GRJ - GARCH, AP ARCH, F IP ARCH, F IGARCH and F IAGARCH models as special cases.

HYGARCH Model

To test whether nonstationarity of the fractional integrated GARCH process

F IGARCH(p, d, q) of Baillie et al. (1996) holds, Davidson (2004) proposed

the hyperbolic GARCH (HY GARCH) model. The F IGARCH process is

expressed as

(L)(1 - L)dt2 =  + (L)t

(9)

with t = 2t - t2. The conditional variance for the F IGARCH(p, d, q) can

10

be represented as

t2

=

 1 - (L) +

(L)(1 - L)d 1 - 1 - (L)

t2

= [1 - (L)]-1 + 1 - [1 - (L)]-1(L)(1 - L)d 2t

(10) (11)

where 0  d  1.
The HY GARCH model is obtained by extending the conditional variance of the F IGARCH(p, d, q) by introducing weights to its difference operator. By replacing 1 - [1 - (L)]-1(L)(1 - L)d in equation (11) by 1 - [1 - (L)]-1(L) 1 +  (1 - L)d , the conditional variance of the HY GARCH process can be formulated as

t2 = [1 - (L)]-1 + 1 - [1 - (L)]-1(L) 1 +  (1 - L)d t2 (12)

This model is able to reproduce the characteristics of volatility clustering, leptokurtosis and long memory but disregards asymmetry and the fact that the conditional volatility is best represented by non-integer powers of the absolute value of the observations. It nests the GARCH models (for  = 0), IGARCH (for  = d = 1) and F IGARCH (for  = 1 or log  = 0).

2.1 Long Memory Test and Estimation
Many empirical studies have focused on testing the presence of long memory in volatility of financial markets. Motivations for such studies include the use of volatility as preliminary measure of risk in financial markets and their predictions can lead to improve forecasts of asset price movement. In this paper, long memory in volatility in an equity portfolio (British F T SE) and German DAX stocks (Bayer, Siemens, Volkswagen) is examined using two proxies of volatility returns: absolute and square returns. The rescaled variance (V /S) test of Giraitis et al. (2003) and two semiparametric estimators of long memory parameter, the log-periodogram regression (GP H) of Geweke and Porter-Hudak (1983) and the Gaussian semiparametric (GSP ) of Robinson (1995a) are employed.

11

Rescaled Variance test Giraitis et al. (2003) introduced the Rescaled Variance test (V /S), by centering the Kwiatkowski et al. (1992), (KP SS) test of trend stationarity against a unit root alternative, based on the partial sum of deviations from the mean. For testing long memory in a stationary series the KP SS statistic is given as

1T KP SST = T 2^T2 (q) k=1

where T2 (q) = ^0 + 2

^j, is the heteroscedastic and auto-

correlation consistent (HAC) estimator of the variance, (q < T ). ^0 is the

variance of the process and the sequence {^j}jq=1 denotes the autocovariances

of the process up to the order q.

Centering KP SST based on the partial sum of the deviations from the mean, the Rescaled Variance test statistic is expressed as:

Giraitis, Kokoszka, Leipus (2001) have shown that this statistic can detect long range dependence in the volatility for the class of ARCH() processes.

Log-Periodogram Estimator Geweke and Porter-Hudak (1983) (GP H), proposed a semi-parametric procedure to obtain an estimate of the fractional difference parameter based on the periodogram of a time series zt, (t = 1, . . . , T ) defined by

1 I(j) = 2T

The memory parame-

ter dGPH is the OLS estimator in a linear regression of the log-periodogram,

12

log I(j) of the process on a constant and a variable Xj = log 4 sin2(j/2) :

dGP H = -

mj=1(Xj - X¯ ) log {I(j)} 2 jm=1(Xj - X¯ )

(16)

The theoretical asymptotic variance of the spectral regression error term

Details on the consistency and asymptotic normality

of the GP H estimator can be found in Geweke and Porter-Hudak (1983),

Robinson (19990), Hassler (1993a). For nonstationary fractional integrated

process, Kim and Phillips (2006) have shown that this estimator is consistent

in the range 0.5 < d  1.

Gaussian Semiparametric Estimator The spectrum of a stationary process with long memory parameter d can be approximated in the neighborhood of the zero frequency

f ()  C-2d

(17)

as   0+, C > 0. The GSP estimator is derived from the approximation,

Robinson (1995a) showed that m(d^GSP - d) d N (0, 1/4) and Robinson (1999) showed its validity in the presence of some form of conditional heteroscedasticity. In general, the ranges of consistency and asymptotic normality for GSP are the same as those of the GP H estimator, Phillips and Shimotsu (2004).

3 Value-at-Risk Analysis
Mathematically, V aR at  probability level can be defined as
V aR,t = Ft-1() = tq
where Ft-1 is the inverse function of the conditional cumulative distribution of the underlying at time t, t is the volatility. In this case, the accuracy of the V aR forecast depends heavily on proper estimation of the volatility t and the assumption of the underlying distribution. In our application, we characterize the F IAP ARCH and HY GARCH models under the studentt and skewed student-t distribution of the error term and compare their performance.
Suppose that f (zt) is the pdf of the standardized residuals zt. We characterize different specifications for f (zt), namely student-t, zt  st(0, 1; ) and skewed student-t, zt  skst(0, 1; , ) where  is the degrees of freedom and  the asymmetry parameter.

for the long and short position is expressed as

V aRL = µ^t + st,^t V aRS = µ^t + st1-,^t

(21) (22)

where st, and st1-, are the left and right quantiles respectively at % for the (standardized) student-t distribution and µ^t, estimate of the sample mean. The student-t distribution has thicker tails and can deal with leptokurtosis, Bollerslev (1987). For independent and student-t distributed innovations, the conditional variance and kurtosis may vary freely over time, Brooks et al. (2005).

The skewed student-t distribution has a density for zt  IR:

The skewed student-t distribution is able to reduce excess kurtosis and skew-

15

ness in standardized residuals, providing efficiency gains. It nests the studentt for  = 1 and the normal distribution for  = 1 and  = .
Under skewed student-t distribution the V aR of  quantile for the long and short position is expressed as

V aRL = µ^t + skst,,^t V aRS = µ^t + skst1-,,^t

(24) (25)

where skst,, and skst1-,, are the left and right quantiles respectively at %.

3.1 Backtesting VaR

To compare the accuracy of the different V aR statistical forecasts, tests based on Kupiec (1995) and Christoffersen (1998) backtesting measures are applied.

Unconditional coverage

The basic idea of the Kupiec (1995) test is to examine whether the failure rate

of a model is statistically equal to the expected one (unconditional coverage).

Let N =

T t=1

It

be

the

number

of

exceptions

in

the

sample

of

size

T,

where

 1 if It+1 = 0 if

rt+1 < V aRt+1|t(p) rt+1  V aRt+1|t(p),

follow a binomial distribution, N

 B(T, p).

If

p

=

E[

N T

]

is

the

expected

exception frequency (expected ratio of violations), then the hypothesis for

testing whether the failure rate of the model equals the expected one, is

given as

H0 : p = p0

(26)

where p0 is a pre-specified V aR level. The appropriate likelihood ratio statistic under H0 is expressed as

LR1 = -2 log p0N (1 - p0)T -N + 2 log (N/T )N (1 - N/T )T -N

(27)

16

Asymptotically, LR1  2(1) distributed under H0. A preferred model for

V aR prediction should exhibit the property that the unconditional coverage,

measured

by

p

=

E[

N T

],

equals

the

desired

coverage

level,

p0.

Conditional coverage

The Christoffersen (1998) likelihood ratio statistics, test the assumption of

unconditional coverage and independence of failures. Let ij = P (1t =

j|1t-1 = i) be the transition probability and nij =

T t=1

1(1t

=

j

and

1t-1

=

i), where i, j = 0 or 1. The test hypothesis of independence is given as:

H0 : 00 = 10 = , 01 = 11 = 1 - 

(28)

One can test the hypothesis of unconditional coverage and independence using the likelihood ratio statistic:

LR2 = -2 log {^n0 (1 - ^)n1 } + 2 log {^0n000 ^0n101 ^1n010 ^1n111 }

2(2). This test has an advantage in that it can reject a V aR model that

generates either too many or too few clustered violations, i.e. it takes into ac-

count the conditionality in the forecast and enables one to separate clustering

effects from distributional assumption effects.

4 Empirical Application

The data consist of daily closing prices for the English F T SE stock index (04.01.2000-30.10.2006) and three German DAX stocks; the Bayer, Siemens and Volkswagen, each from (04.01.2000 - 30.10.2006). For each series, the log-returns is expressed (in %) as,

rt = 100  log

St St-1

denotes the continuously compounded daily returns where St is the stock price at time t. Log-returns have the nice property in that the T - day

17

log-returns are the arithmetic sums of one-day log-returns and therefore one can relate between one-day and T -day Value-at-Risk. Summary statistics presented in Table 1 show that all returns share similar properties in kurtosis. The F T SE index and the Volkswagen stock are negatively skewed. The BoxPierce statistic for remaining serial correlation in the squared standardized residuals (using 24 lags) indicates high serial correlation in the variance. From the descriptive graphics presented in Figure 3, several volatility periods can be observed, such as the periods ending 2001, 2002 and the beginning of 2003. Figure 4 shows the boxplots of log-returns for the four data sets. It also provides evidence of changes in volatilty from time to time.

The V /S test results for long range dependence in the absolute and square

returns are presented in Table 2. At 5% level, we fail to reject long memory

since the evaluated statistic is over the critical value, 0.1869. The GP H

Results not included here show that estimates of d for both estimators fall

within (-0.05 < d < 0.75), the range of consistency for fractional integrated

process with long range dependence, Kim and Phillips (2006).

4.1 Model Estimation
Since the returns show serial autocorrelation, we fit an autoregressive structure to the return series:

(L) = (rt - µ) = t

(30)

where (L) = 1L - · · · - pLp as an autoregressive lag polynomial of order p. We assume that the conditional mean

p
µt = µ + i(rt-i - µ)
i=1

follows an AR(2) process in order to capture non-synchronous trading effects. The process specification is expressed as

rt = c + a1rt-1 + a2rt-2 + t t = ztt

(32) (33)

where zt is identically and independently distributed with zero mean and unit variance, t  (0, t2). For the conditional variance of t, we fit the F IAP ARCH and HY GARCH models under the student-t and skewed student-t distributed innovations. A lag order, p = q = 1 is assumed for both models specifications.
Estimation results for the F IAP ARCH and HY GARCH models are presented in Tables 4 and 5 respectively. Under skewed student-t distribution, returns of the F T SE equity and Siemens stock are skewed to the left, while Bayer and Volkswagen exhibit right skewness. This result also reveal evidence of the fat-tail phenomenon, given that the tail dependence parameter () is significantly different from zero. Since estimates of  for F T SE, Bayer and Siemens are not significantly different from 1 but significantly different from 2, it is more relevant to model the conditional standard deviation instead of the conditional variance. For Volkswagen stock, modelling the conditional variance is relevant as the  estimates are significantly different from 1. In addition,  is positive and significant, indicating leverage effect for negative returns in the conditional variance specification.
For the HY GARCH model results, Table 5, the hyperbolic parameter, log(^) < 0 are not significantly different from zero, indicating that the GARCH components are covariance stationary. The AIC and log-likelihood values show that the F IAP ARCH model with skewed student-t distributed innovations perform better for all the returns series. This is in line with Degiannakis (2004), that the F IAP ARCH models with skewed student-t distributed innovations effectively captures the characteristics of the empirical distribution.
Diagnostic results from the standardized and squared standardized residuals (Q-statistics) and the residual based test (RBD, Tse (2002) for con-

22

ditional heteroscedasticity do not reject the null hypothesis of a correct model specification for both models. The F IAP ARCH model is observed to perform better in modeling the returns than the symmetric (HY GARCH) model. It has the advantage in that, it features asymmetry in relationship between the conditional variance and the lagged squared innovations, whatever the chosen error term. Our reference to symmetry and asymmetry is in relation to the distribution of the innovations. In this case, the F IAP ARCH model is more adequate to model the negative leverage effect with skewed student-t distributed innovations.
Several criteria have been used to assess the forecasting performance of the models; the Mincer-Zarnowitz (1969) regression, Mean Square Error (M SE), Mean Absolute Prediction Error (M AP E) and the logarithmic Loss Function (LL). In-sample one-day-ahead forecast performance of the HY GARCH and F IAP ARCH models under the skewed student-t distributed innovations are given in Table 6. Our result shows that the forecast accuracy for the F IAP ARCH is marginally better compared to the HY GARCH model.
Figure 5 presents plots of the time path of conditional standard deviation for each log-return series based on the F IAP ARCH and HY GARCH models. As observed, the F IAP ARCH model is slightly better in estimating the magnitude of volatility than the HY GARCH. Our results suggest that such models hold the promise of improved long-run volatility forecast and more accurate pricing of long-term contracts. The implication can therefore be extended to the context of risk management. In what follows, we employ the F IAP ARCH model (the EW M A model as benchmark) with skewed student-t distributed innovations for Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall.
4.2 Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall Predictions
For an overview, we present in Figure 6 the V aR predictions for the F T SE index and DAX stocks returns (Bayer, Siemens, Volkswagen) based on the classical EM A and EDF estimation methods. As observed, these methods do not give satisfactory results since the plots show many returns exceeding the V aR. Though EM A gives better calibration results than EDF , it

cannot effectively be applied to model long range dependence because of its exponentially decreasing memory.
We apply the F IAP ARCH model under the skewed student-t distributed innovations to calculate the Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall. Backtesting V aR and ESF results for the F IAP ARCH models are presented in Tables 7 to 10. The computed values are the failure rate, Kupiec LR test and P-values, the Expected Shortfall (ESF ) with significance level,  = 0.01, 0.05 and  = 0.95, 0.99 for long and short positions respectively. The failure rate for short position refers to the percentage of positive returns larger than the VaR prediction, while the failure rate for the long position is the percentage of negative returns smaller than the V AR prediction. Results show that the V aR for the F IAP ARCH model performs very well for the one-day as well as for the five-days time horizon. With more consecutive choice of , the model captures the fat tails exhibited in the returns very well.
The one-step ahead V aR prediction plots, Figure 7 for the F IAP ARCH model shows that the model does well in predicting critical loss for long and short positions. The test of V aR is not rejected for all levels. For

example, the proportion of exceptions at 1% is about 0.8% for F T SE, Bayer, Siemens and 1.1% for Volkswagen. Our results indicate that, models that account for asymmetries as well as fractional integrated parametrization of the volatility process, perform better in predicting V aR and ESF for short and long positions than short memory models. This suggest that for proper risk valuation, the degree of persistence of the process should be investigated and appropriate model that incorporate the existence of such characteristics be taken into account.
Predicted five-days-ahead out-of-sample V aR and ESF forecast results for the EW M A and F IAP ARCH models are presented in Tables 11 and 12 respectively. These forecasts are based on a 'sliding window', updating the model parameters every 50 observations. Though not as good as the insample forecasts, the results show that the F IAP ARCH model specification performs well for out-of-sample V aR predictions.

4.3 Summary
In this paper, we applied Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall to valuate financial market risk when there is long range dependence. We examined the British equity portfolio, F T SE100 and three stocks of the German DAX index (Bayer, Siemens and Volkswagen). Long range dependence test and estimation is carried out using the rescaled variance test of Geweke and Porter-Hudak (1983) (GP H) and two estimators, the log-periodogram regression (GP H), Geweke and Porter-Hudak (1983) and the Gaussian semiparametric (GSP ), Robinson (1995a) estimators. With long memory in the volatility process, we fitted the (HY GARCH) model of Davidson (2004) that can accommodate distributional characteristics such as volatility clustering, leptokurtosis, long memory and the (F IAP ARCH) of Tse (1998), that can well accommodate volatility clustering, leptokurtosis, asymmetry and long memory. In particular, we estimated these models with different error distribution assumptions, the student-t and skewed student-t. Our results show that models that account for asymmetries in the volatility specifications as well as fractional integrated parametrization of the volatility process, perform better in predicting the one-step ahead as well as five-step ahead V aR and ESF for short and long positions than short memory models. Such models hold the promise of improved long-run volatility forecast and more accurate pricing of long-term contracts. We extended this implication to the context of financial risk management. Our results suggest that for proper risk val-
33

uation of equity or portfolio of stocks, the degree of persistence should be investigated and appropriate modelling that incorporate the existence of such characteristic be taken into account.
