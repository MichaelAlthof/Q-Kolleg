Abstract

Given n equidistant realisations of a L¥evy process (Lt, t 0), a natural estimator N^n

for the distribution function N of the L¥evy measure is constructed. Under a polynomial

decay restriction on the characteristic function , a is, a functional central limit theorem for the process

Donn(sN^kner--tyNp)e

theorem is proved, that in the space of bounded

functions away from zero. The limit distribution is a generalised Brownian bridge process

with bounded and continuous sample paths whose covariance structure depends on the Fourier-integral operator F -1[1/(-∑)]. The class of L¥evy processes covered includes several

relevant examples such as compound Poisson, Gamma and self-decomposable processes.

Main ideas in the proof include establishing pseudo-locality of the Fourier-integral operator

and recent techniques from smoothed empirical processes.

sure, then n(Fn - F ) converges in law in the Banach space of bounded functions on R, to a

P -Brownian bridge. The result in itself and its many extensions have been at the heart of much

of our understanding of modern statistics, see the monographs Dudley (1999), van der Vaart and

Wellner (1996) for a comprehensive account of the foundations of this theory.

The purpose of this article is to investigate a conceptually closely related problem: at equidis-

tant time steps tk = k, k = 0, 1, . . . , n, one observes a trajectory of a L¥evy process with

corresponding L¥evy (or jump) measure , and wishes to estimate the distribution function N

of . Since we do not assume that the time distance  varies (in particular, no high-frequency

regime), we equivalently observe a sample from an infinitely divisible distribution given by the

i.i.d. increments of the process. Since  is only a finite measure away from zero the natural target

a rate of convergence (by any estimator N^ )

without certain qualitative assumptions on the L¥evy process. Particularly, the process cannot

contain a nonzero Gaussian component. On the other hand, and perhaps surprisingly, we show

in the present article that for a large and relevant class of L¥evy processes a Donsker theorem can

be proved.

Similar to Donsker's classical theorem our results have interesting consequences for statistical

inference, such as the construction of confidence bands and goodness of fit tests. While we do

not address these issues explicitly here and concentrate on spelling out the mathematical ideas,

it is nevertheless instructive to discuss some related literature on statistical inference on the

L¥evy triplet from discrete observations. The basic principle for understanding the nonlinearity

in this setting is already inherent in the problem of decompounding a compound Poisson process,

which has been studied in queuing theory and insurance mathematics. In this case the L¥evy

measure  is a finite measure and by explicit inversion in the convolution algebra Buchmann and Gru®bel (2003) prove a central limit theorem with rate 1/ n for a plug-in estimator of N in an

exponentially weighted supremum norm, assuming that the intensity of the process is known.

For general L¥evy triplets the estimation problem is generally ill-posed in the sense of inverse

problems. In fact, the linearized problem is of deconvolution-type where the part of the error

distribution is taken over by the observation law itself. This phenomenon, which could be coined

auto-deconvolution, was first studied by Belomestny and Reiﬂ (2006). For the general problem

of estimating functionals of the L¥evy measure the results by Neumann and Reiﬂ (2009) show in particular that a functional can be estimated at parametric rate 1/ n provided its smoothness

outweighs the ill-posedness induced by the decay of the characteristic function. Comparing to

Neumann and Reiﬂ (2009) we are thus interested in the low regularity functional f 

t -

f

(not covered by their results), and in exact limiting distributions. Instead of making inference on

the distribution function, one may also be interested in the associated nonparametric estimation problem for a Lebesgue density of the L¥evy measure, where the rate 1/ n can never be attained.

This problem was studied in Gugushvili (2009) for L¥evy processes with finite jump activity and

a Gaussian part, Comte and Genon-Catalot (2010) for a model selection procedure in the finite

variation case, or Trabs (2011) for self-decomposable processes. Generalisations for observations

of more general jump processes like L¥evy-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes or affine processes are

considered by Jongbloed, van der Meulen and van der Vaart (2005) and Belomestny (2011).

The proof of our main result contains certain subtleties that we wish to briefly discuss here: In the classical Donsker case one proves that the empirical process n(Pn - P ) is tight in the space of bounded mappings acting on {1(-,t] : t  R}. The ill-posedness of the L¥evy-problem can be roughly understood, after linearisation, as requiring to show that the empirical process
n(Pn - P ) is tight in the space of bounded mappings acting on the class

G = {F -1[1/(-∑)]  1(-,t] : |t| )},

(1.1)

where  > 0 is arbitrary, F is the Fourier transform and where  = FP is the characteristic
function of the increments of the L¥evy process. In fact, the situation is more complicated than that, but the above simplification highlights the main problem. Convolution with F -1[1/] is just a way of writing deconvolution with P = F -1[], which is mathematically understood

2

as the action of a pseudo-differential operator, and the class G can be shown not to be P Donsker (arguing as in Theorem 7 in Nickl (2006), for instance), unless in very specific situations (effectively in the compound Poisson case discussed above). In other words, the empirical process is not tight when indexed by these functions.
A starting point of our analysis is that for certain L¥evy processes a generalised P -Brownian bridge G with bounded sample paths can be defined on G, uniformly continuous for the intrinsic covariance metric of G, see Theorem 9. Roughly speaking this means that a tight limit process exists, and that a limit theorem at rate 1/ n may hold if one replaces the empirical process by a smoothed one. This hope is nourished by the phenomenon ≠ first observed, in a general empirical process setting unrelated to the present situation, by Radulovi¥c and Wegkamp (2000), and recently developed further in several directions by Gin¥e and Nickl (2008) ≠ that smoothed empirical processes may converge in situations where the unsmoothed process does not. The results in Gin¥e and Nickl (2008) apply to unbounded classes, so in particular to G, and this idea in combination with a thorough analysis of the pseudo-differential operator F -1[1/(-∑)] are at the heart of our proofs.
The paper is organised as follows: Section 2 contains the exact conditions on the model, the construction of the estimator and the main result. In Section 3 the model assumptions, some important examples and potential extensions are discussed. Finally, the complete proof of the Donsker-type result is given in Section 4, divided into the finite-dimensional central limit theorem and the uniform tightness result.

2 The Setting and Main Result

We observe a real-valued L¥evy process (Lt, t 0) at equidistant time points tk = k, k = 0, 1, . . . , n, for  > 0 fixed. It will be seen to be natural (Section 3) to restrict to L¥evy processes
of (locally) finite variation. In this case the characteristic function of the increments Xk := Ltk - Ltk-1 is given by

(u) = E[exp(iuL)] = e(u) where (u) = iu +

(eiux - 1) (dx)

R \{0}

with drift parameter   R and L¥evy (or jump) measure  satisfying

(|x|  1) (dx) <  (due
R

to finite variation). The increments X1, . . . , Xn are i.i.d. and we write P for the law of Xk and p

the empirical measure and empirical characteristic function, respectively. Throughout F denotes

the Fourier (-Plancherel) transform acting on finite measures, on the space L1(R) of integrable or on the space L2(R) of square-integrable functions on R, see e.g. Katznelson (1976) for the

standard Fourier techniques that we shall employ.

If  has a finite first moment, then the weighted L¥evy measure x(dx) can be identified

directly from the law of Xk in the Fourier domain:

1  (u) = -i (u) =  + eiuxx(dx) =  + F [x](u). i (u)

(2.1)

Our goal is to estimate the cumulative distribution function of ,

((-, t]), t < 0, N (t) :=
([t, )), t > 0,

(2.2)

from the sample X1, . . . , Xn. Note that in general N (t) tends to infinity for t  0. If we denote by F -1 the inverse Fourier transform, then the relation (2.1) suggests a natural empirical estimate
of N (t) (we shall see below that  can be neglected),

where K is a band-limited kernel function and Kh(x) := h-1K(x/h). In the sequel the kernel will be required to satisfy

K = 1, supp(F K)  [-1, 1] and |K(x)| + |K (x)| (1 + |x|)- for some  > 2. (2.4)

Throughout, we shall write Ap Bp if Ap CBp holds with a uniform constant C in the parameter p as well as Ap  Bp if Ap Bp and Bp Ap.
The smooth spectral cutoff induced by multiplication with FKh is desirable for various reasons; in particular, it will imply that N^n is well-defined with probability tending to one. By Plancherel's formula, we have the alternative representation

Heuristically, for hn  0 we expect consistency N^n(t)  N (t) in probability, t = 0, because as hn  0 we have Khn  0 (the Dirac measure in zero) and thus F Khn (u)  1 which may be combined with the law of large numbers for both n and n. For this argument to work it is important to note that the drift  induces a point measure in zero for F -1[ /] which is
outside the support of gt, compare Section 4.1.1 below. For our precise results we shall need the following conditions on the data-generating L¥evy process.

1 Assumption. We require for some  > 0: (a) max(|x|, |x|2+) (dx) < ; (b) x has a bounded Lebesgue density and |F[x](u)| (c) (1 + |u|)-1+-1(u)  L2(R).

(1 + |u|)-1;

Assumption 1(a) imposes finite variation, ensuring the identification identity (2.1), as well as finite (2 + )-moments of  and P , since by Thm. 25.3 in Sato (1999)

|x|2+(dx) <   |x|2+P (dx) < .

(2.5)

As N^ is based on n(u), and since a central limit theorem is desired, it is natural to require a finite second moment of Xk. The additional  in the power will allow to apply the Lyapounov
criterion in the CLT for triangular schemes and to obtain uniform in u stochastic bounds for
n(u) -  (u) over increasing intervals. Assumptions 1(b,c) are discussed in more detail after the following theorem, which is the main result of this article.
For  > 0, let ((-, -]  [, )) be the space of bounded real-valued functions on
(-, -]  [, ) equipped with the supremum norm. Convergence in law in this space, denoted by L, is defined as in Dudley (1999), p.94.

and where gt is given in (2.3).

In view of xgt(x) = 1(-,t](x) for t < 0 and symmetrically for t > 0, the representation of the covariance in the theorem above is intuitively appealing when compared to the classical
Donsker theorem. Its rigorous interpretation, however, needs some care, as it is not quite clear how the pseudo-differential operator F -1[-1(-∑)] acts on the indicator function xgt(x). One rigorous representation that follows from our proofs uses

F -1 -1(-∑)  1(-,t] = F -1 (1 + iu)-1-1(-u)  (1(-,t] + t)
together with the fact that F -1[(1+iu)-1-1(-u)] can be shown to be contained in L1(R)L2(R) under Assumption 1 (using lifting properties of Besov spaces), so that the right-hand side of the last display is defined almost everywhere.
Another more explicit representation, which also implies that t,t < , is the following: Note that formally

F -1
R

1 (-∑)



(xgt(x))dP (x)

=

1 2

(F [xgt](-∑))(u)-1(u)(u) du = (xgt)(0) = 0,
R

which explains why the covariance in Theorem 2 is centered for t = 0. Moreover, F[xgt] = i-1(F [gt]) and integration by parts gives rise to the formally equivalent representation

t,s = (i)-2 ht(x)hs(x)P (dx)
R

(2.6)

where

ht(x) = F -1[-1(-u)F gt(u)](x)ix + F -1[(-1) (-u)F gt(u)](x),

and where we note that i-1ht is real-valued. This expression for ht is the one we shall employ in our proofs, as it can be shown to be rigorously defined in L2(P ) under the maintained
assumptions, see (4.10) below for more details.
Moreover the last representation immediately suggests consistent estimators of t,s based on the empirical characteristic function n and the empirical measure Pn, useful when one is interested in the Gaussian limiting distribution for inference purposes on N .

3 Discussion
3.1 The regularity conditions
 We remark first that the results in Neumann and Reiﬂ (2009) imply that we can attain a 1/ nrate for estimation only if the characteristic function decays at most with a low polynomial order.

This restricts the classes of L¥evy processes automatically to the (locally) finite variation case (e.g. proof of Prop. 28.3 in Sato (1999)), and moreover excludes all L¥evy processes with a nonzero Gaussian component.
Let us next discuss Assumption 1(c) which describes the lower bound we need on the illposedness of the estimation problem. It holds for all compound Poisson processes, in which case |-1(u)| is bounded, but also for Gamma processes with   (0, 1/(2)) and for purejump self-decomposable processes with not too high jump activity at zero, see Proposition 3 below. Recall (e.g. Sato (1999), Section 15) that self-decomposable distributions describe the limit laws of suitably rescaled sums of independent random variables as well as the stationary distributions of L¥evy-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, and thus give rise to a rich nonparametric class of L¥evy measures. More generally, if E[eiuL1 ] decays polynomially, then there exists a 0 > 0 such that for all  < 0 the corresponding characteristic function (u) = E[eiuL ] satisfies |-1(u)| (1 + |u|) for  < 1/2, so Assumption 1(c) holds for any polynomially decaying  if the sampling frequency is large (i.e.,  small) enough. Abstractly, Assumption 1(c) means that the pseudo-differential operator F -1[-1] of deconvolution is an element of the L2-Sobolev space H-1+(R) of negative order  - 1. In the simpler problem of statistical deconvolution an analogous restriction for the characteristic function of the error variables is necessary, even if one is only interested in rates of convergence of an estimator, and the situation is similar here: The lower bound techniques from Theorem 4.4 of Neumann and Reiﬂ (2009) or Theorem 1 of Lounici and Nickl (2011) can be adapted to the present situation to imply, for instance, that for Gamma processes with  > 1/(2) the 'parametric' rate 1/ n cannot be achieved by any estimator in the L¥evy estimation problem considered here, so that Assumption 1(c) is in this sense sharp for Theorem 2.
The smoothness condition on x in Assumption 1(b) is not very restrictive: it is satisfied whenever the weighted L¥evy measure x has a density whose weak derivative is a finite measure (noting x  L1(R) by Assumption 1(a)). As simple examples, any compound Poisson process with a jump density of bounded variation and a finite first moment satisfies this condition, as does any Gamma process. More generally, most self-decomposable processes satisfy this condition, see Proposition 3 below.
The key role of Assumption 1(b) is not to enforce smoothness of , but to ensure pseudolocality of the deconvolution operator F -1[-1] in the sense that the location of singularities like the jump in the indicator 1(-,t] remains unchanged under deconvolution. In the spirit of the theory of pseudo-differential operators this is established by differentiating in the spectral domain, see (4.9) below for details,
F -1[-1(-u)] = 1 F -1[(-1(-u)) ] i∑
under the condition that (-1) =  -1  L2(R). Neglecting the drift,  is F [ix] and Assumptions 1(b), 1(c) together ensure (-1)  L2(R), see Lemma 4 below. As discussed later, the example of a superposition of a Gamma and Poisson process provides a simple concrete situation where a violation of this condition renders the asymptotic variance in Theorem 2 infinite.
There is another interesting interaction between Assumptions 1(b) and 1(c). A decay rate |u|-1 for F [x](u) is the maximal possible smoothness requirement under 1(c); otherwise |Re( (u))| |F [x](u)| = o(|u|-1) would imply |(u)| = exp(Re((u))) = exp(o(log(u))) for |u|  , excluding polynomial decay of the characteristic function .
3.2 Examples
We now discuss a few examples in more detail.
6

Compound Poisson Processes. The compound Poisson case where  is a finite measure is covered in Theorem 2. Note that due to the presence of a point mass at zero in P the characteristic function satisfies infu|(u)| exp(-2(R)) > 0. Therefore Assumption 1(c) is trivially satisfied. Assumption 1(b) requires that the law of the jump sizes has a density  such that x(x) is bounded and has the respective decay property in the Fourier domain. Assumption 1(a) just postulates (2 + ) finite moments of the jump law. Compared to Buchmann and Gru®bel (2003) we thus obtain directly a uniform central limit without weighting, exponential moments and, perhaps more importantly, without prior knowledge of the intensity, yet our result holds only away from the origin and under Assumption 1(b).
Stronger results can be obtained by adapting our method to this specific case because the distribution function N of  is defined classically for all t  R and Assumption 1(b) is not required to ensure pseudo-locality of deconvolution. In fact, deconvolution reduces to convolution with a signed measure because of (Øk denotes k-fold convolution)

F -1[-1(-∑)] =

Therefore, F -1[-1(-∑)]  1(-,t] is a bounded function, in fact of bounded variation, and the uniform CLT for the linearized stochastic term follows directly (since BV -balls are

We do not pursue a detailed derivation of this
specific case here.

Gamma Processes. The family of Gamma processes satisfies Xk  (, ), i.e. (dx) = x-1e-x1R+ (x) dx, (u) = (1 - iu/)-. For simplicity we consider  = 1 and, in order to satisfy Assumption 1(c), we restrict to   (0, 1/(2)). We denote the density of (, 1) by  and its distribution function by . Then
F -1[-1] = F -1[(1 - iu)-1(1 - iu)] = 1-  (Id +D)

holds with the differential operator D. This is a well known form of the fractional derivative operator of order . We deduce

F -1[-1(-∑)]  1[t,) = 1-(-∑)  (1[t,) - t).

Hence, for t > 0 the asymptotic variance of Theorem 2 is given by



t,t =

(1 - 1-(t - x) - 1-(t - x))2(x) dx.

0

Note that the integrand has poles of order ()2 at x = t and of order 1 -  at x = 0 such that the variance is finite if and only if  < 1/2 and t = 0. This indicates again why our Assumption 1(c) is indeed necessary.

Moreover, the Gamma process case can serve as a basic example for all the theory that follows. It reveals the problem that standard Lp-theory or non-local Fourier analysis will not be sufficient in this context as different locations of the singular support (the poles) are required to ensure finiteness of t,t.

7

Gamma plus Poisson process. Let us briefly give a simple counterexample that pseudolocality of the deconvolution operator is important. If the L¥evy process is a superposition of a Gamma process as above with   (0, 1/(2)) and of an independent Poisson process with intensity  > 0, the density p of the increments is given by the convolution of the -density with a Poiss()-law and thus has poles of order 1 -  at x  N0. On the other hand, the deconvolution operator is given by

F -1[-1(-∑)] =



e(-1)k k!

k=0

As in the pure Gamma case, this shows that t,t is finite if and only if none of the poles at x = t - k, k  N0, and at x = k, k  N0, of the respective functions coincide, which is the case only for non-integer t / N0. Consequently, we cannot hope even to prove a pointwise CLT with rate 1/ n at integers t. This case that singularities are just translated
by convolution with point measures is excluded by the regularity requirement for x in
Assumption 1(b).

Self-Decomposable Processes. We finally consider the class of self-decomposable processes, cf. Sato (1999), Section 15, which contains all Gamma processes. For any pure-jump selfdecomposable process we have (dx) = k(x)/|x| dx with a unimodal k-function increasing on (-, 0) and decreasing on (0, ). If the limits k(0-) and k(0+) of k at zero are finite, then k is a function of bounded variation and so is sgn(x)k(x), the density of x. The moment condition of Assumption 1(a) in particular implies sgn(x)k(x)  L1(R) which yields Assumption 1(b). It is quite remarkable that the probabilistic property of self-decomposability implies the analytic property of pseudo-locality for the deconvolution operator.
For the characteristic function of self-decomposable processes we have |(u)| (1+|u|)- with  = k(0-) + k(0+), which follows exactly as the proof of Lemma 2.1 in Trabs (2011). The latter is the counterpart to Lemma 53.9 in Sato (1999), where an upper bound of the same order times a logarithmic factor is shown. We conclude that Assumption 1(c) translates to the condition  < 1/(2).

We note that Assumption 1(a) and 1(b) remain true under superposition of independent L¥evy processes and we collect the findings in an explicit statement.

3 Proposition. Assumption 1 is satisfied for

(a) a compound Poisson process whenever the jump law has a density  such that x is of bounded variation and  has a finite (2 + )-moment,
(b) a Gamma process with parameters   (0, 1/(2)) and  > 0,

(c) a pure-jump self-decomposable process whenever its k-function satisfies max(1, |x|1+)k(x) dx <  and k(0-) + k(0+) < 1/(2),

(d) and for any L¥evy process which is a sum of independent compound Poisson and selfdecomposable processes of the preceding types.

3.3 Extensions and perspectives
There are many directions for further investigation. As from the classical Donsker result, concrete statistical inference procedures, like L¥evy-analogues of the classical Kolmogorov-Smirnov-tests and corresponding confidence bands, can be derived from Theorem 2. Also extensions to uniform CLTs for more general functionals than just for the distribution function are highly relevant. A question of particular interest in the area of statistics for stochastic processes is whether one can allow for high-frequency observation regimes n  0. As discussed above, decreasing   0 renders the inverse problem more regular, as Assumption 1(c) is then easier to satisfy. Since we use the central limit theorem for triangular arrays in our proofs, allowing  to depend on n should not pose a principal difficulty, but doing so in a sharp way may not only require an estimator based on the second derivative of log(n), but also extra care in controlling all terms uniformly in n, and is beyond the scope of the present paper.
Another issue of statistical relevance is the question of efficiency, which we briefly address here. Our plug-in estimation method is quite natural and should have asymptotic optimality properties as the empirical distribution function has for the classical i.i.d. case. This is also in line with the result by Klaassen and Veerman (2011) who show that the tangent space of the class of infinitely divisible distributions with positive Gaussian part is nonparametric to the effect that the estimation of linear functionals g dP of P (but not  as in our case) by empirical means is asymptotically efficient. Indeed, a formal derivation indicates that the pointwise asymptotic variance of our estimator N^n(t) coincides with the Cram¥er-Rao information bound. Let us restrict here to the case t < 0 and assume that the observation law P has a Lebesgue density p.
Perturbing the L¥evy measure  in direction of an L1-function h, we obtain by differentiating in the Fourier domain the score function (the derivative of the log-likelihood)

P (dx).

On the other hand, we aim at estimation the functional   N (t) whose derivative in direction

h by linearity is given by H(t) = 1(-,t], h (interpreting ∑, ∑ as a dual pairing). The semi-

parametric Cram¥er-Rao lower bound is then suph

h = F -1[-1]  p ◊ F -1[-1(-u)]  1(-,t] - F -1[-1(-u)]  1(-,t](0) .

Resuming the formal calculus and noting that F -1[-1(-u)] is the formal adjoint of F -1[-1], we find the explicit Cram¥er-Rao bound

1(-,t](x)h(x) dx = F -1[-1(-u)]  1(-,t] (x)p (x) F -1[-1(-u)]  1(-,t] (x) dx,

which is exactly equal to the asymptotic variance t,t from Theorem 2. We have used here that F -1[-1(-u)]  1(-,t](X) is centred, cf. (4.2) below.
The hardest parametric subproblem of our general semi-parametric estimation problem is thus given by perturbing  in direction of h. The lower bound for the variance equals exactly the

9

asymptotic variance of our estimator. Let us nevertheless emphasize that this formal derivation
of the Cram¥er-Rao lower bound does not justify asymptotic efficiency in a completely rigorous manner: for this one would have to establish the regularity of the statistical model and h  L1(R), which appears to require an even finer analysis of the main terms than our Donsker-type
result. The complete proof remains a challenging open problem.

4 Proof of Theorem 2

The remainder of this article is devoted to the proof of Theorem 2, which is split into the separate proofs of convergence of the finite-dimensional distributions and of tightness. We shall repeatedly use the following auxiliary lemma.
4 Lemma. Suppose  = 0. Then Assumption 1 implies:
(a) The measure xP = xP (dx) has a bounded Lebesgue density on R. (b) (-1)  L2(R)  L(R) as well as |-1(u)| (1 + |u|)(1-)/2 for all u  R; (c) m(u) := -1(-u)(1+iu)(-1+)/2 is a Fourier multiplier on every Besov space Bps,q(R) with
s  R, p, q  [1, ]; that is convolution with F -1m is continuous from Bps,q(R) to Bps,q(R). Proof.
(a) From (2.1) with  = 0 we see

F[ixP ](u) =  (u) = iF[x](u)FP (u)  xP = (x)  P

and thus with x (Assumption 1(b)) also xP has a Lebesgue density xp(x) with xp   x .

(b) From Assumption 1(b) and  = 0 we deduce | (u)| (1 + |u|)-1 and thus (1 + |u|)(-1) L2 -1(1 + |u|)-1+ L2 <  by Assumption 1(c). This implies

|-1(u)|

u
1+ |(-1) (v)| dv
0

1+ (1+|v|)(-1) L2 (1+|v|)-1[0,u] L2

(1+|u|)(1-)/2,

and then also |(-1) |(u) |-1(u)|| (u)| 1, so (-1)  L(R).

(c) The Fourier multiplier property of m follows from the Mihlin multiplier theorem for Besov spaces (see e.g. Triebel (2010) and particularly the scalar version of Cor. 4.11(b) in Girardi and Weis (2003)): because of (b) the function m is bounded and satisfies

|um (u)| |um(u)|(1 + |u|)-1 1.

Consequently, the conditions of Mihlin's multiplier theorem are fulfilled and m is a Fourier multiplier on all Besov spaces Bps,q(R).

4.1 Convergence of the Finite-Dimensional Distributions
Denote by Hs(R), s  R, the standard L2-Sobolev spaces with norm h Hs := F f (u)(1 + |u|)s L2 .
5 Definition. We say that a function g  L(R)  L2(R) is admissible if

(a) g is Lipschitz continuous in a neighbourhood of zero,

(b) we can split g = gc + gs into functions gc  H1(R), gs  L1(R), satisfying max(|F [gs](u)|, |F [xgs](u)|) (1 + |u|)-1 for all u  R.

6 Lemma. The functions gt from (2.3) as well as all finite linear combinations i igti with i  R, ti = 0, are admissible. Moreover, we can choose gtc, gts in such a way that
gtc H1 (1 + |t|)-1/2, |F gts(u)| (1 + |u|)-1(1 + |t|)-1 and |F [xgts](u)| (1 + |u|)-1,

the inequalities holding with constants independent of u  R, t  R \(-, ) for  > 0 fixed.

Proof. First note that all properties of admissible functions remain invariant under finite linear combinations and reflection g  g(-∑). It thus suffices to check that gt, t < 0, is admissible. Let   C((-, 0]) be a smooth bounded function with (0) = 1 and ,  both integrable on (-, 0], for instance (x) = ex1(-,0]. Decompose gt = gtc + gts with
gtc(x) = gt(x)(1 - (x - t)), gts(x) = gt(x)(x - t); for x t,
and both equal to zero for x > t. Then gtc  L2(R) and its (weak) derivative is
(gtc) (x) = -x-2(1 - (x - t))1(-,t](x) + x-1(1 - (x - t)) 1(-,t](x)  L2(R),
so gtc  H1(R). The functions gts, xgts are both integrable since  is. The (weak) derivatives of xgts and gts are  (x-t)1(-,t) -t and -x-2(x-t)1(-,t] +x-1 (x-t)1(-,t) -t-1t, respectively, with point measures t. So, both functions are of bounded variation and their Fourier transforms are bounded by (1 + |u|)-1 up to multiplicative constants. Finally, observe that gt is constant and thus Lipschitz near zero, so that gt is admissible.
For the second claim we again only consider t < 0 and first observe,  being bounded, that

gtc

as t  -. Likewise, using the explicit form of (gtc) , we see

gtc H1

gtc L2 + (gtc) L2 (1 + |t|)-1/2.

For gts = x-11(-,t](t-x) we see gts L1 t-1  L1 , and the total variation of the derivative of gts is bounded by t-2  L1 + t-1  L1 + t-1. We conclude that |F gts(u)| (1 + |u|)-1(1 + |t|)-1 holds. The same argument gives a bound independent of t for |F [xgts](u)|, thus completing the proof.

Proof. This follows directly by the Cram¥er-Wold device applied to any finite subfamily of (gt, t  R \{0}), using the preceding lemma and theorem.

The remaining part of this subsection is devoted to the proof of Theorem 7.

4.1.1 Discarding the drift 

We shall show that we may assume  = 0 in the sequel. To see this, observe that shifting Xk  X~k = Xk +  leads to the shift in the empirical quotient

n(u)/n(u)  ~n(u)/~n(u) = (eiun) (u)/(eiun(u)) = i + n(u)/n(u)
and the true quotient also satisfies ~ (u)/~(u) = i +  (u)/(u). In N^n(g) - N (g) this shift thus induces the error

These manipulations are justified by standard Fourier analysis of finite measures, using the compact support of F Kh and of Pn as well as that (1 + |u|)-1-1(u), F g, (-1) are all in L2(R) (by virtue of Assumption 1(c), admissibility of g, Lemma 4(b)).
Thus, the central limit theorem for triangular arrays under Lyapounov's condition (e.g. The-
orem 28.3 combined with (28.8) in Bauer (1996)) applies to the standardised sums if

inequality, Assumption 1(c) and admissibility of g

|F [gc](u)||-1(-u)|du
R

gc H1 F -1[-1] H-1 < .

(4.4)

Since also suph>0,u|F Kh(u)| K L1 <  we have F [gc]-1(-∑)F Kh  L1(R) and thus

sup F -1[-1(-u)F gc(u)F Kh(-u)]  L(R).
h(0,1)

The integral over the first term in (4.3) with gc replacing g is thus finite in view of |x|2+P (dx) <  by Assumption 1(a).
For the singular part we remark |(F Kh) (u)| xKh L1 h as well as (by Assumption 1(b)) |(-1) (u)| = | (u)-1(u)| (1 + |u|)-1|-1(u)|. We conclude uniformly in h, using admissibility of g,

|(-1(-∑)F gsF Kh(-∑)) (u)| |-1(u)|(1 + |u|)-1.

By Assumption 1(c) and the Sobolev embedding this implies

sup F -1[-1(-u)F gs(u)F Kh(-u)](x)(1 + ix)  H(R)  L2+(R).
h

(4.5)

Using Lemma 4(a) and |x|2+ |x||1 + ix|2+, also the integral over the first term in (4.3) with

gs replacing g is finite.

For the integral over the second term in (4.3) we recall suph>0,u|F Kh(u)| K L1 <  and that F g, (-1) are both in L2(R) to deduce |F g(u)F Kh(-u)(-1) (-u)|  L1(R) by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. By Fourier inversion F -1[F g(u)F Kh(-u)(-1) (-u)]  L holds,
and since P is a probability measure, also the integral over the second term is finite.

Altogether we have shownthat under our conditions the main stochastic error term totically normal with rate 1/ n and mean zero. For n   the variances converge to

is asympg2, which

follows from F Khn  1 pointwise and uniform integrability by bounded (2 + )-moments.

4.1.4 Remainder term

In what follows Pr stands for the usual product probability measure P N describing the joint law

of X1, X2, . . . , and Zn = OP (rn) means that rn-1Zn is bounded in Pr-probability. We show that

From Theorem 4.1 of Neumann and Reiﬂ (2009) we have for any  > 0, using the finite

(2 + )-moment property of P from (2.5),

sup |n(u) - (u)| + |n(u) -  (u)| = OP (n-1/2(log U )1/2+).
|u| U

This implies in particular, using

> (-1 - 1) u  [-h-n 1, h-n 1]

Pr sup |n(u) - (u)| n-1/4(log n)-/2  0
|u| h-n 1

as n  , in other words, on events of probability approaching one, -n 1 decays no faster than -1 uniformly on increasing sets [-h-n 1, h-n 1].
Now to control the remainder term (4.1) we use supp(F Kh)  [-h-1, h-1] and distinguish each term of the decomposition g = gs + gc. First, using |F gs(u)| (1 + |u|)-1, Lemma 4(b)
and Assumption 1(c) we see

h-1
F gs(-u)F Kh(u)Rn(u) du
-h-1

h-1
(1 + |u|)-1n-1(log h-1)1+2|-1(u)| |(u)-1| + |(-1) (u)| du
-h-1

= OP n-1(log h-1)1+2h2-1 (1 + |u|)-2+2|(u)|-2du

= OP n-1(log h-1)1+2h2-1 .

For the nonsingular part we have likewise, using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, gc  H1(R), (4.6), Assumption 1(c),

h-1
F gc(-u)F Kh(u)Rn(u) du = OP n-1(log h-1)1+2

1/2

(1 + |u|)-2|(u)|-4 du

-h-1

= OP n-1(log h-1)1+2h-1/2 -1(1 + |u|)-1 L2 .

Consequently, the remainder term is of order oP (n-1/2) and thus negligible because hn-1+2(log hn-1)1+2 = o(n1/2). Note that this gives in fact uniform oP (n-1/2)-control of the
remainder term for all g that satisfy the admissibility bounds uniformly.

4.2 Tightness of the Linear Term

We study the linear part (4.2) and introduce the empirical process

n(t)

:=

1 n i

R

F -1 -1(-u)F gt(u)F Khn (-u) (x)ix +

(4.7)

F -1 (-1) (-u)F gt(u)F Khn (-u) (x) (Pn - P )(dx), |t|  > 0.

Recall that this process is centered even without subtracting P . Moreover, since sup|t|  gt L2 < , the arguments after (4.2) imply that n is a (possibly non-measurable) random element of the space ((-, )c) of bounded functions on (-, -]  [, ) (the complement of (-, ) in R) equipped with the uniform norm ∑ (-,)c .

15

4.2.1 Pregaussian limit process
Theorem 2 will follow if we show that n converges to G in law in ((-, )c). For this statement to make sense we have to show first that G defines a proper Borel random variable in ((-, )c), which is implied by the following more general result. Recall that any Gaussian process {G(t)}tT induces its intrinsic covariance metric d2(s, t) = E(G(s) - G(t))2 on the index set T .

9 Theorem. Grant Assumption 1. The Gaussian process {G(t)}t:|t|  with covariance given by (2.6) admits a version, still denoted by G, which has uniformly continuous sample paths almost surely for the intrinsic covariance metric of G, and which satisfies supt:|t|  |G(t)| <  almost
surely.

The proof moreover implies that (-, )c is totally bounded in the metric d. Therefore (a version of) G concentrates on the separable subspace of ((-, )c) consisting of bounded d-uniformly continuous functions on (-, )c, from which we may in particular conclude that G
defines a Borel-random variable in that space, and hence is also a Borel random variable in the ambient space ((-, )c).
Next to Dudley's entropy integral, the main tool in the proof of Theorem 9 is the following bound for the pseudo-differential operator F -1[-1(-u)]. For f  L2(R) we set F -1[-1(-∑)]  f := F -1[-1(-u)F f (u)] which is well defined at least in H-(1-)/2(R) in view of Lemma 4. Alternatively, F -1[-1(-∑)]  f L2 (1 + |u|)(1-)/2F f (u) L2 whenever f  H(1-)/2(R), but such an inequality is not sufficient for our purposes. We need a stronger estimate for functions f
supported away from the origin, and with the ∑ L2 -norm replaced by the ∑ 2,P -norm. Intuitively speaking, and considering the example f = 1(s,t], s < t < 0, relevant below, this strengthening is possible since the locations of singularities of 1(s,t] and of P (at the origin) are separated away from each other, and since this remains so after application of the pseudo-local operator F -1[-1(-∑)]  (∑) to f .

10 Proposition. Grant Assumption 1 and define h 2,P := ( h2dP )1/2. For f  L2(R) with supp(f )  (-, ) =  for some  > 0 we have

F -1[-1(-u)]  f 2,P

(1 + |u|)1-F f (u) +L2+4/(R)

f (y)2

1/2

1 + y2 dy

(4.8)

provided the right-hand side is finite. The constant in this bound depends only on .

Proof. We shall need the pseudo-differential operator identity

(F -1[-1(-u)]  f )(x) =

1 F -1[(-1(-u)) ]  f (x), i∑

f  L2(R), x / supp(f ),

(4.9)

where the right hand side is defined classically. This identity is fundamental for establishing the property of pseudo-locality in a C-framework, see e.g. Theorems 8.8 and 8.9 in Folland (1995). Let us verify this identity here, where -1 / C. Consider f  L2(R) and g any smooth
compactly supported test function such that supp(f )  supp(g) = . Then (f  g(-∑))(0) = 0 and f  g is smooth from which we may conclude that also x-1(f  g(-∑))(x) (equal to (f  g) (0) at zero) is in L2(R) and smooth, and that

F (f  g(-∑))(x) (u) = F [f  g(-∑)](u) = F f (u)F g(u). ix

16

Plancherel's formula, integration by parts and Fubini's theorem (using (-1)  L2(R) from Lemma 4 and the support properties) yield

(F -1[-1(-u)]  f )(x)g(x) dx = 1 -1(-u)F f (u)F g(u) du 2

-1 =

(-1(-u)) F (f  g(-∑))(x) (u) du

2 ix

F -1[(-1(-u)) ](x) = (f  g(-∑))(-x) dx
ix

= F -1[(-1(-u)) ]  f (x)g(x) dx. i∑

In this calculation the boundary terms vanish due to the fast decay of F[(f  g(-∑))(x)/x] (g
smooth). Consequently, (4.9) follows by testing with all g supported near x.
We use H®older's inequality, the Hausdorff-Young inequality from Fourier analysis, the bound p(x) |x|-1 from Lemma 4, the pseudo-differential operator identity, again Ho®lder's inequality, Assumption 1(c) and (-1)  L2 in view of Lemma 4 in this order to obtain for  = /2:

Proof of Theorem 9. We consider the generalised Brownian bridge process arising as the pointwise weak limit of (4.7), so with F Kh  1, and further split gt = gtc + gts as in the proof of Lemma 6. More precisely, we study the Gaussian process indexed by (i)-1 times

ht(x) = F -1[(-1) (-u)F gt(u)](x) + F -1[-1(-u)F gt(u)](x) ix

(4.10)

= F -1[(-1) (-u)F gt(u)](x) + F -1[-1(-u)F gtc(u)](x) + F -1[-1(-u)F gts(u)](x) ix,

where |t| . The theorem is thus proved if we show that the class of functions G = {(i)-1ht : t  R \(-, )} is bounded in L2(P ) and P -pregaussian (cf. Dudley (1999), Chapter 2, p.92-93). In Section 4.1.3 above we have shown the L2+(P )-boundedness of the same function class, but
also involving the kernel Kh. The same proof, replacing F Kh just by one, shows that G is even L2+(P )-bounded. To establish that G is pregaussian it suffices, by Dudley's integral-criterion,
to find a suitable -covering of G in the intrinsic covariance metric d(s, t) := ht - hs 2,P , for every ht, hs  G.

17

Consider first increments for s < t, |s - t| 1, min(|s|, |t|) ,

ht(x) - hs(x) = F -1[(-1) (-u)F [gt - gs](u)](x) + F -1[-1(-u)F [gt - gs](u)](x)ix = iF -1[-1(-u)F [x(gt - gs)](u)](x) = iF -1[-1(-u)]  1(s,t](x),

for which Proposition 10 yields, with f = 1(s,t], the Ho®lder-type bound

This will give us a polynomially growing covering of G for all t in a fixed compact interval. To deal with large |t| we shall establish the polynomial decay bound ht 2,P |t|-1/2 as
|t|  , and we shall do this for each of the three terms in the second line of (4.10) separately.
For the first term, say ht(1), this follows from

as t  -, and likewise for t  , using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and Lemma 4(b).
For the second term ht(2) we use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, the finite second moment of P , Assumption 1(c) and Lemma 6 to the effect that

For the third term, since xP has a bounded density by Lemma 4(a), it suffices to bound F -1[-1(-u)F gts](x)|x|1/2 L2 ,
which by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality can be estimated by

F -1[-1(-u)F gts]x

1/2 L2

F -1[-1(-u)F gts]

Now by Lemma 6 we know |F gts(u)| (1 + |u|)-1(1 + |t|)-1, |F [xgts](u)| (1 + |u|)-1 and since |(-1) |(u) (1 + |u|)-1|-1(u)| from the proof of Lemma 4 we can estimate the product in the last display to obtain the overall bound

h(t3) 2,P (1 + |t|)-1/2 -1(-u)(1 + |u|)-1 L2 (1 + |t|)-1/2

in view of Assumption 1(c). In conclusion, we can construct an -covering of G by the functions (i)-1hti with ti = i/M
and i = -M 2, . . . , +M 2 where M = M () grows polynomially in -1. This shows that the
covering numbers corresponding to this -net satisfy

log(N (G, L2(P ), )) log(-1).

The square-root of this entropy bound is integrable at zero as a function of , which completes the proof by Dudley's continuity criterion (Theorem 2.6.1 in Dudley (1999)).

4.2.2 Uniform CLT for the linear term

11 Theorem. Grant Assumption 1 and

(n(t1), . . . n(tk)) L (G(t1), . . . , G(tk))
as n   for every finite set (t1, . . . , tk)  (-, )c. If hn n-1/(4) for some  > (1 - )/2, so in particular if hn  n-1/2(log n)- for some  > 1, then
n L G in ((-, )c)

as n  .

Proof. We set  = 1 and suppose that the kernel is symmetric, i.e. F Kh(-u) = F Kh(u), to ease notation. Given convergence of the finite-dimensional distributions it suffices to prove uniform tightness of {n}nN in ((-, )c), cf. van der Vaart and Wellner (1996), Chapter 1.5. We shall in what follows decompose n into a sum of several processes indexed by t, and prove tightness of each of these processes separately, which implies tightness of the sum of the processes by the asymptotic equicontinuity characterisation of tightness in ((-, )c) (e.g., Theorem 1.5.7 in
van der Vaart and Wellner (1996)) and by the triangle inequality. We shall also frequently use the simple fact that tightness is preserved under isometric injections of ((-, )c): if  is a process indexed by s and  a process indexed by functions fs  F , and if (s) =  (fs) for every s  (-, )c, then tightness of  in (F ) (normed by H F := supfF |H(f )|) implies tightness of  in ((-, )c).
We decompose gt = gtc + gts as in the proof of Lemma 6 with the particular choice (x) = ex1(0,](x). The integrand of n(t) in (4.7) equals
F -1[-1(-u)F [ixgts]F Kh](x) + F -1[-1(-u)F gtsF [ixKh]](x)
+ F -1[-1(-u)F gtcF Kh](x)ix + F -1[(-1) (-u)F gtcF Kh](x)
=: (T1 + T2 + T3 + T4)(x)

The process indexed by the component T1 is critical and its tightness is proved in Section 4.2.3
below. Concerning T2, we have |-1(-u)F gtsF [ixKh]| |-1(-u)|(1 + |u|)-2 by xKh L1 +
(xKh) L1 1, uniformly in h, and by the admissibility of gt. By Assumption 1(c) we deduce that T2 lies in a fixed norm ball of H1(R). For T4 we note |(-1) | 1, suph>0,u |F Kh(u)| K 1 < , sup|t|  gtc H1 <  by Lemmas 4 and 6, so {F -1[(-1) (-u)F gtcF Kh](∑), |t| } is bounded in H1(R). For T3 we use |-1(u)| (1 + |u|)(1-)/2 and

-1(-u)F gtcF Kh H(1+)/2

(1 + |u|)F gtc L2 = gtc H1 < ,

uniformly in |t| , again by Lemmas 4 and 6. We conclude that the norms T2 + T4 H1 and T3/x H(1+)/2 are bounded uniformly in t  (-, )c, h > 0. Each summand in T2 + T3 + T4 is therefore contained in a fixed P -Donsker-class: For T2 + T4 this follows from Proposition 1 in
Nickl and Po®tscher (2007) with s = 1, p = q = 2, and for T3 we apply Corollary 5 for weighted Besov-Sobolev spaces in Nickl and Po®tscher (2007) with parameter choice s = (1 + )/2,  = -1,
p = q = 2,  = /2 noting that the moment condition there is satisfied by (2.5). The empirical process n is thus indexed by functions T2 + T3 + T4 that change with n but that are contained in a fixed P -Donsker class, and so is tight by the asymptotic equicontinuity criterion. Together with the tightness of the critical term, derived below, this proves tightness of n.

Combining now the convergence of the finite-dimensional distributions from Corollary 8 with Theorem 11 and the uniform bounds on the remainder and bias term we have succeeded in proving Theorem 2.

4.2.3 The critical term

Note that in the ill-posed case lim|u| (u) = 0, for instance when (u) = (1 - iu)-, the class
involving T1 with F Kh = 1 is not P -Donsker even for P with bounded density. The reason is, roughly speaking, that F -1[-1(-∑)]  (ex-t1(-,t]) is then unbounded at t, and classes that
contain functions unbounded at any point cannot be Donsker for such P , cf. the proof of Theorem

7 in Nickl (2006). This implies that one cannot use h = 0, i.e., Kh = 0, in the proofs, as could have been done in the 'noncritical' terms T2, T3, T4 above. Rather, one needs to exploit the fact that the kernel Kh smooths out the singularities for h fixed, and if hn does not approach zero

too fast, there is still hope to obtain a uniform central limit theorem, as shown in a different but

conceptually related situation of Theorems 9 and 10 in Gin¥e and Nickl (2008).

As compactly supported kernels facilitate the arguments considerably, we introduce the trun-

cated kernel

Kh(0) := Kh1[-/2,/2].

By the decay of K and K from (2.4) we can again treat the term involving Kh -Kh(0) by classical methods. Using Kh - Kh(0) BV h-2 where ∑ BV is the usual bounded variation norm, we
obtain |-1(-u)F [ixgts]F [Kh - Kh(0)](u)| |-1(-u)|(1 + |u|)-2h-2,

whence F -1[-1(-u)F [ixgts]F [Kh - Kh(0)]]  H1(R) follows, even with in h shrinking and in t uniform norms. As for the terms T2, T4 above, we thus deduce the uniform tightness of this term since norm balls in H1(R) are universally Donsker.
Recalling gts(x) = x-1ex-t1(-,t](x), the term involving the truncated kernel can be written
as F -1[-1(-u)F [ixgts]F Kh(0)] = iq(∑ - t)  Kh(0)

with

q(x) := F -1[-1(-u)(1 + iu)-1](x).

(4.12)

The regularity of q in the scale of Besov spaces Bps,r(R) is s = (1 + )/2 for p = 1 and r = : Since m(u) = -1(-u)(1 + iu)-1/2+/2 is a Fourier multiplier on B1(1,+)/2(R) by Lemma 4(c), this assertion follows from the fact that

F -1[(1 + iu)-1/2-/2](x) = (1/2 + /2)-1|x|/2-1/2ex1(-,0](x)

(a Gamma-type density) is an element of that space. The latter follows either by checking directly that its L1-modulus of smoothness satisfies (h)1 h1/2+ or by noting that multiplication by (1 + iu)(1-)/2 in the Fourier domain is an isomorphism between B1(1,+)/2(R) and B11,(R) and F -1[(1 + iu)-1](x) = ex1(-,0](x) is of bounded variation and thus contained in B11,(R). Moreover, by embedding theorems for Besov spaces, q is then also an element of B1s,1(R)  L1(R)  L2(R) for any s < (1 + )/2. We refer to Triebel (2010) for these standard properties of
Besov spaces.
We are thus left with proving tightness of

 (x)(Pn - P )(dx) = n

q(y - t) Kh(0)  (Pn - P ) (y) dy, |t|

which is a smoothed empirical process indexed by

The following general purpose result follows from the proof of Theorem 3 in Gin¥e and Nickl (2008), which builds on fundamental ideas in the classical paper Gin¥e and Zinn (1984), and can be applied to the unbounded processes relevant here. For a given class of measurable functions F we write
F = {f - g : f, g  F , f - g 2,P }.
We shall rather loosely use the standard empirical process terminology from Gin¥e and Nickl (2008).

12 Theorem. Let F be any P -pregaussian class of real-valued functions on Rd and let {µn}n=1 be a sequence of finite signed measures defined on Rd satisfying supn µn < . Let µØn(A) = µn(-A). Assume that F  L1(|µn|) holds for every n and, in addition,
(a) for each n, the class F~n := {f  µØn : f  F} consists of functions whose absolute values are bounded by a constant Mn;
(b) supfF E(f  µØn(X))2 42 for every  > 0 and n n0  n0() large enough;
(c) for i.i.d. Rademacher variables (i)i, independent of the Xi's, we have

1 n

n

if (Xi)

i=1

(F~n )1/n1/4

(4.15)

as n   in outer probability;

(d) n 1F~n is in the L2(P )-closure of µ -times the symmetric convex hull of some fixed P pregaussian class of functions FØ.

(e) For all 0 <  < 1, the L2(P )-metric entropy of F~n satisfies H(F~n, L2(P ), ) n()/2 for functions n() such that n()  0 and n()/2   as   0, uniformly in n, and
the bounds Mn of part (a) satisfy

-1
Mn 5 n(1/n1/4)

(4.16)

for all n large enough.

 Then n(Pn - P )  µn is uniformly tight in the Banach space

(F ) (equipped with the uniform

norm ∑ F ).

Proof. The only differences to Theorem 3 in Gin¥e and Nickl (2008) are in (b), which can be weakened as we only establish tightness in this theorem and not convergence of the finite-dimensional distributions, and in the new condition (d), which replaces translation invariance of F by a more generic condition. Note that Theorem 0.3 in Dudley (1973) implies that L2(P )-closures of symmetric convex hulls of pregaussian classes are again pregaussian, which is all that is needed for the proof of Theorem 3 in Gin¥e and Nickl (2008) to apply.

We now verify these conditions for the classes above, with dµn(y) = Kh(0)(y)dy. Let us first show that the class F from (4.14) is indeed P -pregaussian. By Proposition 10 applied to

f (x) = ex(e-t1(x t) - e-s1(x s)), t, s - (and symmetrically for t, s )

21

and by the same estimates as in the proof of Theorem 9

q(∑ - t) - q(∑ - s) 2,P |t - s|(3+2)/(2+2).

(4.17)

Moreover, the tail bound for the third term in that proof applies exactly here such that the same
arguments show that F has polynomially growing covering numbers and is thus pregaussian. In particular, F is bounded in L2(P ). The functions q(∑ - t) are in B1(1,+)/2(R)  L1(R)  L2(R) and thus in L1(|µn|) since K is bounded.

(a) the envelopes of q(∑ - t)  Kh are of order Mn h- for   ((1 - )/2, ) when h = hn n-1/(4) since the sup-norm is bounded by the BV-norm, which in turn is
bounded in point (c) below.

(b) Let g  F, then Kh(0)  g 2,P

Kh(0)  g - g 2,P +  and the result follows from the

triangle inequality if we show Kh(0)  f - f 2,P  0 uniformly over f  F . From (4.8)

above, noting supp(Kh(0)  (i∑gts))  (-/2, /2) = , we conclude

Kh(0)  f - f 2,P

(1 + |u|)-(F Kh(0) - 1) +L2+4/ Kh(0)  f - f L2 .

Since F Kh(0)(u) is uniformly bounded and tends to 1 pointwise and since (1 + |u|)-(2+4) is integrable, by dominated convergence the first norm tends to zero for h  0. Similarly,
as F f  L2 holds, (F Kh(0) - 1)F f L2  0 follows and by Plancherel's theorem also the second norm converges to zero. This convergence is uniform because of |Ff (u)| = |Fq(u)|
for all f  F and due to q  L2(R).

(c) The class {Kh(0)  q(∑ - t) : |t| } consist of translates of the fixed function Kh(0)  q, which is a function of bounded variation with BV-norm of size h- for some   ((1 - )/2, )

using Nickl

q  B111- (R) from (2008) (whose proof

the argument after (4.12) and the estimate (61) in applies also to the truncated kernels). The envelope

Gin¥e and Mn of F~n

is then of the same size since the BV-norm bounds the supremum norm. Moreover the

class {Kh(0)  q(∑ - t) : |t| } has polynomial L2(Q)-covering numbers, uniformly in all probability measures Q. To see this we argue as in Lemma 1 in Gin¥e and Nickl (2009): note

that a function of bounded variation is the composition of a 1-Lipschitz function with a

monotone function. The set of all translates of a monotone function has VC-index 2, and

hence has polynomial covering numbers by Theorem 5.1.15 in de la Pen~a and Gin¥e (1999),

with constants A, v there independent of n. Composition with a 1-Lipschitz map preserves
the entropy, and the estimate (22) in Gin¥e and Nickl (2008) with envelopes Mn  hn- and Hn()  H()  log() now shows that

(d) Using that Kh(0) is supported in [-/2, /2], one shows by standard arguments that the class of functions

h>0

R

22

is in the L2(P )-closure of K L1 -times the symmetric convex hull of the P -pregaussian class FØ = {q(∑ - t) : |t| /2} . To see this one can either make a minor modification of the argument in Lemma 1 in Gin¥e and Nickl (2008), or notice that, {q(∑ - t) : |t| /2} being bounded in the separable Banach space L2(P ) (cf. after (4.17)), the integrals q(∑ - t - y)Kh(0)(y)dy are L2(P )-valued Bochner-integrals, and can thus be obtained as L2(P )-limits of simple functions lying in the symmetric convex hull of {z  K L1 q(z - t) : |t| /2} (e.g., Appendix E and Theorem E.3 in Dudley (1999)).
(e) Write f, g for distinct translates of q (elements of F), and deduce from Minkowski's inequality for integrals that

E (f  Kh(0)(X) - g  Kh(0)(X))2 1/2

|Kh(u)| f (-u - ∑) - g(-u - ∑) 2,P du
-/2
K L1 sup f (u - ∑) - g(u - ∑) 2,P .
|u| /2

Since entropy bounds are preserved under Lipschitz transformations, and since

{q(u - ∑ - t) : |t| , |u| /2}  {q(u - ∑ - t) : |t| /2}

has polynomial L2(P )-covering numbers by the same arguments as after (4.17), we deduce

the bound H(F~n, L2(P ), ) log(-1) for every  > 0 small enough, independent of n. Conclude that we can take n() = log(-1)2, so that the envelope condition (4.16)

becomes

hn- (log n)-1/2n1/4,

(4.18)

which is satisfied due to  <  and hn- n1/4, completing the proof.
