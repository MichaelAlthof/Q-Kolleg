Abstract
The paper studies a problem of constructing simultaneous likelihood-based confidence sets. We consider a simultaneous multiplier bootstrap procedure for estimating the quantiles of the joint distribution of the likelihood ratio statistics, and for adjusting the confidence level for multiplicity. Theoretical results state the bootstrap validity in the following setting: the sample size n is fixed, the maximal parameter dimension pmax and the number of considered parametric models K are s.t. (log K)12p3max/n is small. We also consider the situation when the parametric models are misspecified. If the models' misspecification is significant, then the bootstrap critical values exceed the true ones and the simultaneous bootstrap confidence set becomes conservative. Numerical experiments for local constant and local quadratic regressions illustrate the theoretical results.

The problem of simultaneous confidence estimation appears in numerous practical applications when a confidence statement has to be made simultaneously for a collection of objects, e.g. in safety analysis in clinical trials, gene expression analysis, population biology, functional magnetic resonance imaging and many others. See e.g. Miller (1981); Westfall (1993); Manly (2006); Benjamini (2010); Dickhaus (2014), and references therein. This problem is also closely related to construction of simultaneous confidence bands in curve estimation, which goes back to Working and Hotelling (1929). For an extensive literature review about constructing the simultaneous confidence bands we refer to Hall and Horowitz (2013), Liu (2010), and Wasserman (2006).
A simultaneous confidence set requires a probability bound to be constructed jointly for several possibly dependent statistics. Therefore, the critical values of the corresponding statistics should be chosen in such a way that the joint probability distribution achieves a required family-wise confidence level. This choice can be made by multiplicity correction of the marginal confidence levels. The Bonferroni correction method (Bonferroni (1936)) uses a probability union bound, the corrected marginal significance levels are taken equal to the total level divided by the number of models. This procedure can be very conservative if the considered statistics are positively correlated and if their number is large. The Sida¥k correction method (Sida¥k (1967)) is more powerful than Bonferroni correction, however, it also becomes conservative in the case of large number of dependent statistics.
Most of the existing results about simultaneous bootstrap confidence sets and resamplingbased multiple testing are asymptotic (with sample size tending to infinity), see e.g. Beran (1988, 1990); Hall and Pittelkow (1990); H®ardle and Marron (1991); Shao and Tu (1995); Hall and Horowitz (2013), and Westfall (1993); Dickhaus (2014). The results based on asymptotic distribution of maximum of an approximating Gaussian process (see Bickel and Rosenblatt (1973); Johnston (1982); H®ardle (1989)) require a huge sample size n , since they yield a coverage probability error of order (log(n))-1 (see Hall (1991)). Some papers considered an alternative approach in context of confidence band estimation based on the approximation of the underlying empirical processes by its bootstrap counterpart. In particular, Hall (1993) showed that such an approach leads to a significant improvement of the error rate (see also Neumann and Polzehl (1998); Claeskens and Van Keilegom (2003)). Chernozhukov et al. (2014a) constructed honest confidence bands for nonparametric density estimators without requiring the existence of limit distribution of the supremum of the studentized empirical process: instead, they used an approximation between sup-norms of an empirical and Gaussian processes, and anti-concentration

property of suprema of Gaussian processes. In many modern applications the sample size cannot be large, and/or can be smaller
than a parameter dimension, for example, in genomics, brain imaging, spatial epidemiology and microarray data analysis, see Leek and Storey (2008); Kim and van de Wiel (2008); Arlot et al. (2010); Cao and Kosorok (2011), and references therein.
For the recent results on resampling-based simultaneous confidence sets in highdimensional finite sample set-up we refer to the papers by Arlot et al. (2010) and Chernozhukov et al. (2013a, 2014a,b). Arlot et al. (2010) considered i.i.d. observations of a Gaussian vector with a dimension possibly much larger than the sample size, and with unknown covariance matrix. They examined multiple testing problems for the mean values of its coordinates and provided non-asymptotic control for the family-wise error rate using resampling-type procedures. Chernozhukov et al. (2013a) presented a number of non-asymptotic results on Gaussian approximation and multiplier bootstrap for maxima of sums of high-dimensional vectors (with a dimension possibly much larger than a sample size) in a very general set-up. As an application the authors considered the problem of multiple hypothesis testing in the framework of approximate means. They derived non-asymptotic results for the general stepdown procedure by Romano and Wolf (2005) with improved error rates and in high-dimensional setting. Chernozhukov et al. (2014a) showed how this technique applies to the problem of constructing an honest confidence set in nonparametric density estimation. Chernozhukov et al. (2014b) extended the results from maxima to the class of sparsely convex sets.
The present paper studies simultaneous likelihood-based bootstrap confidence sets in the following setting:
1. the sample size n is fixed;
2. the parametric models can be misspecified;
3. the number K of the parametric models can be exponentially large w.r.t. n ;
4. the maximal dimension pmax of the considered parametric models can be dependent on the sample size n .
This set-up, in contrast with the paper by Chernozhukov et al. (2014b), does not require the sparsity condition , in particular the dimension p1, . . . , pK of each parametric family may grow with the sample size. Moreover, the simultaneous likelihood-based confidence sets are not necessarily convex, and the parametric assumption can be violated.
The considered simultaneous multiplier bootstrap procedure involves two main steps: estimation of the quantile functions of the likelihood ratio statistics, and multiplicity correction of the marginal confidence level. Theoretical results of the paper state the

zhilova, m.

bootstrap validity in the setting 1-4 taking in account the multiplicity correction. The resulting approximation bound requires the quantity (log K)12p3max/n to be small. The log-factor here is suboptimal and can probably be improved. The paper particularly focuses on the impact of the model misspecification. We distinguish between slight and strong misspecifications. Under the so called small modeling bias condition (SmB) given in Section 5.2 the bootstrap approximation is accurate. This condition roughly means that all the parametric models are close to the true distribution. If the (SmB) condition is not fulfilled, then the simultaneous bootstrap confidence set is still applicable, however, it becomes conservative. This property is nicely confirmed by the numerical experiments in Section 4.
Let the random data

Y d=ef (Y1, . . . , Yn)

(1.1)

consist of independent observations Yi , and belong to the probability space (, F, IP ) . The sample size n is fixed. IP is an unknown probability distribution of the sample Y . Consider K regular parametric families of probability distributions:

{IPk()} d=ef {IPk() µ0,   k  IRpk } , k = 1, . . . , K.

Each parametric family induces the quasi log-likelihood function for   k  IRpk

Lk(Y , ) d=ef log

dIPk() (Y ) dµ0

.

(1.2)

It is important that we do not require that IP belongs to any of the known parametric families {IPk()} , that is why the term quasi log-likelihood is used here. Below in this section we consider two popular examples of simultaneous confidence sets in terms of the quasi log-likelihood functions (1.2). Namely, the simultaneous confidence band for local constant regression, and multiple quantiles regression.
The target of estimation for the misspecified log-likelihood Lk() is such a parameter k , that minimises the Kullback-Leibler distance between the unknown true measure IP and the parametric family {IPk()} :

k d=ef argmax IELk().
k
The maximum likelihood estimator is defined as:

(1.3)

k d=ef argmax Lk().
k

6 Simultaneous bootstrap confidence sets

The parametric sets k have dimensions pk , therefore, k, k  IRpk . For 1  k, j  K and k = j the numbers pk and pj can be unequal.
The likelihood-based confidence set for the target parameter k is

Ek(z) d=ef   k : Lk(k) - Lk()  z2/2  IRpk .

(1.4)

Let zk() denote the (1 - ) -quantile of the corresponding square-root likelihood ratio statistic:

zk() d=ef inf z  0 : IP Lk(k) - Lk(k) > z2/2   .

(1.5)

Together with (1.4) this implies for each k = 1, . . . , K :

IP k  Ek (zk())  1 - .

(1.6)

Thus Ek(z) and the quantile function zk() fully determine the marginal (1 - ) confidence set. The simultaneous confidence set requires a correction for multiplicity . Let c() denote a maximal number c  (0, ] s.t.

IP This is equivalent to

K k=1

2Lk(k) - 2Lk(k) > zk(c)

 .

(1.7)

c() d=ef sup c  (0, ] : IP max
1kK

2Lk(k) - 2Lk(k) - zk(c) > 0   . (1.8)

Therefore, taking the marginal confidence sets with the same confidence levels 1 - c() yields the simultaneous confidence bound of the total level 1- . The value c()  (0, ] is the correction for multiplicity. In order to construct the simultaneous confidence set using this correction, one has to estimate the values zk(c()) for all k = 1, . . . , K . By its definition this problem splits into two subproblems:

1. Marginal step. Estimation of the marginal quantile functions z1() , . . . , zK() given in (1.5).

2. Correction for multiplicity. Estimation of the correction for multiplicity c() given in (1.8).

If the 1 -st problem is solved for any   (0, 1) , the 2 -nd problem can be treated by
calibrating the value  s.t. (1.8) holds. It is important to take into account the correlation between the likelihood ratio statistics Lk(k) - Lk(k) , k = 1, . . . , K , otherwise the estimate of the correction c() can be too conservative. For instance, the Bonferroni

correction would lead to the marginal confidence level 1 - /K , which may be very conservative if K is large and the statistics Lk(k) - Lk(k) are highly correlated.
In Section 2 we suggest a multiplier bootstrap procedure, which performs the steps 1 and 2 described above. Theoretical justification of the procedure is given in Section 3. The proofs are based on several approximation bounds: non-asymptotic square-root Wilks theorem, simultaneous Gaussian approximation for 2 -norms, Gaussian comparison, and simultaneous Gaussian anti-concentration inequality.
Spokoiny and Zhilova (2014) considered the 1 -st subproblem for the case of a single parametric model ( K = 1 ): a multiplier bootstrap procedure was applied for construction of a likelihood-based confidence set, and justified theoretically for a fixed sample size and for possibly misspecified parametric model. In the present paper we extend that approach for the case of simultaneously many parametric models.
Below we illustrate the definitions (1.2)-(1.8) of the simultaneous likelihood-based confidence sets with two popular examples.
Example 1 (Simultaneous confidence band for local constant regression): Let Y1, . . . , Yn be independent random scalar observations and X1, . . . , Xn some deterministic design points. Consider the following quadratic likelihood function reweighted with the kernel functions K(∑) :

L(, x, h) d=ef - 1 2

wi(x, h) d=ef K({x - Xi}/h),

K(x)  [0, 1], K(x)dx = 1, K(x) = K(-x).
IR

Here h > 0 denotes bandwidth, the local smoothing parameter. The target point and

the local MLE read as:

(x, h) d=ef

n i=1

wi(x,

(x, h) d=ef

.

(x, h) is also known as Nadaraya-Watson estimate. Fix a bandwidth h and consider
the range of points x1, . . . , xK . They yield K local constant models with the target parameters k d=ef (xk, h) and the likelihood functions Lk() d=ef L(, xk, h) for k = 1, . . . , K . The confidence intervals for each model are defined as

Ek(z, h) d=ef    : L((xk, h), xk, h) - L(, xk, h)  z2/2 ,

for the quintile functions zk() and for the multiplicity correction c() from (1.5) and (1.8) they form the following simultaneous confidence band:

8 Simultaneous bootstrap confidence sets

In Section 4 we provide results of numerical experiments for this model. Example 2 (Multiple quantiles regression): Quantile regression is an important
method of statistical analysis, widely used in various applications. It aims at estimating conditional quantile functions of a response variable, see Koenker (2005). Multiple quantiles regression model considers simultaneously several quantile regression functions based on a range of quantile indices, see e.g. Liu and Wu (2011); Qu (2008); He (1997). Let Y1, . . . , Yn be independent random scalar observations and X1, . . . , Xn  IRd some deterministic design points, as in Example 1. Consider the following quantile regression models for k = 1, . . . , K :

Yi = gk(Xi) + k,i, i = 1, . . . , n,
where gk(x) : IRd  IR are unknown functions, the random values k,1, . . . , k,n are independent for each fixed k , and

IP (k,i < 0) = k for all i = 1, . . . , n.

The range of quantile indices 1, . . . , K  (0, 1) is known and fixed. We are interested in simultaneous parametric confidence sets for the functions g1(∑), . . . , gK(∑) . Let fk(x, ) : IRd ◊ IRpk  IR be known regression functions. Using the quantile regression approach by Koenker and Bassett Jr (1978), this problem can be treated with the quasi maximum likelihood method and the following log-likelihood functions:
n
Lk() = - i=1 k (Yi - fk(Xi, )) , k (x) d=ef x (k - 1I {x < 0}) .

for k = 1, . . . , K . This quasi log-likelihood function corresponds to the Asymmetric

Laplace distribution with the density k(1 - k)e-k (x-a) . If  = 1/2 , then 1/2(x) =

|x|/2 and L() = -

The paper is organised as follows: Section 2 describes the multiplier bootstrap proce-

dure, Section 3 explains the ideas of the theoretical approach and provides main results

in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 correspondingly. All the necessary conditions are given in Section

5. In Section 5.3 and in statements of the main theoretical results we provide information

about dependence of the involved terms on the sample size and parametric dimensions

in the case of i.i.d. observations. Proofs of the main results are given in Section C.

Statements from Sections A and B are used for the proofs in Section C. Numerical ex-

periments are described in Section 4: we construct simultaneous confidence corridors

for local constant and local quadratic regressions using both bootstrap and Monte Carlo

procedures. The quality of the bootstrap procedure is checked by computing the effective

simultaneous coverage probabilities of the bootstrap confidence sets. We also compare

the widths of the confidence bands and the values of multiplicity correction obtained

with bootstrap and with Monte Carlo procedures. The experiments confirm that the

multiplier bootstrap and the bootstrap multiplicity correction become conservative if the

local parametric model is considerably misspecified. The results given here are valid on a random set of probability 1 - Ce-x for some

explicit constant C > 0 . The number x > 0 determines this dominating probability

level. For the case of the i.i.d. observations (see Secion 5.3) we take x = C log n .

2 The multiplier bootstrap procedure

Let i,k() denote the log-density from the k -th parametric distribution family evaluated at the i -th observation:

(2.1)

then due to independence of Y1, . . . , Yn

Lk() =

n
i=1 i,k()  k = 1, . . . , K.

Consider i.i.d. scalar random variables ui independent of the data Y , s.t. IEui = 1 , Var ui = 1 , IE exp(ui) <  (e.g. ui  N (1, 1) or ui  exp(1) or ui  2Bernoulli(0.5) ). Multiply the summands of the likelihood function Lk() with the new random variables:

ab Lk ()

d=ef

n
i=1 i,k()ui,

(2.2)

then it holds IE ba Lkba () = Lk() , where IE ba stands for the conditional expectation given Y.

Therefore, the quasi MLE for the Y -world is a target parameter for the bootstrap

world for each k = 1, . . . , K :

ab ab argmaxk IE Lk () = argmaxk Lk() = k.

The corresponding bootstrap MLE is:

ba Lk ().

and the arguments k

to Lkab(kab) - Lkab(k) , , k are known and

available for computation. This means, that given the data Y , one can estimate the distribution or quantiles of the statistic Lkab(kab)-Lkab(k) by generating many independent

samples of the bootstrap weights u1, . . . , un and computing with them the bootstrap

likelihood ratio.

Let us introduce similarly to (1.5) the (1 - ) -quantile for the bootstrap square-root

likelihood ratio statistic:

(2.3)

here IP ab denotes probability measure conditional on the data Y , therefore, zkab() is a random value dependent on Y .

Spokoiny and Zhilova (2014) considered the case of a single parametric model ( K = 1 ), and showed that the bootstrap quantile zkba () is close to the true one zk() under
a so called "Small Modeling Bias" (SmB) condition, which is fulfilled when the true

distribution is close to the parametric family or when the observations are i.i.d. When the

SmB condition does not hold, the bootstrap quantile is still valid, however, it becomes conservative. Therefore, for each fixed k = 1, . . . , K the bootstrap quantiles zkba () are rather good estimates for the true unknown ones zk() , however, they are still
"pointwise" in k , i.e. the confidence bounds (1.6) hold for each k separately. Our

goal here is to estimate z1(), . . . , zK() and c() according to (1.7) and (1.8). Let us introduce the bootstrap correction for multiplicity:

By its definition c ba () depends on the random sample Y .

  . (2.4)

The multiplier bootstrap procedure below explains how to estimate the bootstrap quantile functions zkab (c ab()) corrected for multiplicity.

The simultaneous bootstrap procedure:

Input: The data Y (as in (1.1)) and a fixed confidence level (1 - )  (0, 1).

Step 1: Generate B independent samples of i.i.d. bootstrap weights {u(1b), . . . , un(b)} , b = 1, . . . , B . For the bootstrap likelihood processes

to preserve the correlation structure between the ratios and, therefore, to make a sharper

simultaneous adjustment in Step 3.

This procedure is justified theoretically in the next section.

3 Theoretical justification of the bootstrap procedure
Before stating the main results in Section 3.2 we introduce in Section 3.1 the basic ingredients of the proofs. The general scheme of the theoretical approach here is taken from Spokoiny and Zhilova (2014). In the present work we extend that approach for the case of simultaneously many parametric models.
3.1 Overview of the theoretical approach
For justification of the described multiplier bootstrap procedure for simultaneous inference it has to be checked that the joint distributions of the sets of likelihood ratio statistics Lk(k) - Lk(k) : k = 1, . . . , K and Lkba (kab) - Lkab(k) : k = 1, . . . , K are close to each other. These joint distributions are approximated using several non-asymptotic

The first two approximating steps: square root Wilks and Gaussian approximations

are performed in parallel for both Y and bootstrap worlds, which is shown in the cor-

responding lines of the scheme (3.1). The two worlds are connected in the last step:

Gaussian comparison for 2 -norms of Gaussian vectors. All the approximations are performed simultaneously for K parametric models.

Let us consider each step in more details. Non-asymptotic square-root Wilks approx-

pk , n

here the index k is fixed, i.e. this statement is for one parametric model. The precise

statement of this result is given in Section B.1, and its simultaneous version ≠ in Sec-

tion B.3. The approximating value k is 2 -norm of the score vector k given in (3.2). The next approximating step is between the joint distributions of 1 , . . . , K and 1 , . . . , K . This is done in Section A.1 for general centered random vectors under bounded exponential moments assumptions. The main tools for the simultaneous

Gaussian approximation are: Lindeberg's telescopic sum, smooth maximum function and

three times differentiable approximation of the indicator function 1I{x  IR : x > 0} .

The simultaneous anti-concentration inequality for the 2 -norms of Gaussian vectors is obtained in Section A.3. The result is based on approximation of the 2 -norm with a maximum over a finite grid on a hypersphere, and on the anti-concentration inequality

for maxima of a Gaussian random vector by Chernozhukov et al. (2014c). The same

approximating steps are performed for the bootstrap world, the square-root bootstrap

Wilks approximation is given in Sections B.2, B.3. The last step in the scheme (3.1)

is comparison of the joint distributions of the sets of ab ba

2 -norms of Gaussian vectors:

1 , . . . , K and 1 , . . . , K by Slepian interpolation (see Section A.2 for the

result in a general setting). The error of approximation is proportional to

The value Hk-1Bk2Hk-1 is responsible for the modelling bias of the k -th model. If the parametric family {IPk()} contains the true distribution IP or if the observations
Yi are i.i.d., then Bk2 equals to zero. Condition (SmB) assumes that all the values Hk-1Bk2Hk-1 are rather small.

The following theorem shows the closeness of the joint cumulative distribution functions

(c.d.f-s.) of

2Lk(k) - 2Lk(k), k = 1, . . . , K and

2Lkab(kab) - 2Lkab(k), k =

1, . . . , K . The approximating error term total equals to a sum of the errors from

all the steps in the scheme (3.1).

Remark 3.1. The obtained approximation bound is mainly of theoretical interest, although it shows the impact of pmax , K and n on the quality of the bootstrap procedure. For more details on the error term see Remark A.1.

The next theorem justifies the bootstrap procedure under the (SmB) condition. The theorem says that the bootstrap quantile functions zkab(∑) with the bootstrap-corrected for multiplicity confidence levels 1 - c ab() can be used for construction of the simultaneous
confidence set in the Y -world.

The following theorem does not assume the (SmB) condition to be fulfilled. It turns
out that in this case the bootstrap procedure becomes conservative, and the bootstrap critical values corrected for the multiplicity zkab (c ba ()) are increased with the modelling bias tr{Dk-1Hk2Dk-1} - tr{Dk-1(Hk2 - Bk2)Dk-1} , therefore, the confidence set based
on the bootstrap estimates can be conservative.

The (SmB) condition is automatically fulfilled if all the parametric models are correct or in the case of i.i.d. observations. This condition is checked for generalised linear model and linear quantile regression in Spokoiny and Zhilova (2014) (the version of 2015).

16 Simultaneous bootstrap confidence sets

4 Numerical experiments
Here we check the performance of the bootstrap procedure by constructing simultaneous confidence sets based on the local constant and local quadratic estimates, the former one is also known as Nadaraya-Watson estimate Nadaraya (1964); Watson (1964). Let Y1, . . . , Yn be independent random scalar observations and X1, . . . , Xn some deterministic design points. In Sections 4.1-4.3 below we introduce the models and the data, Sections 4.4-4.6 present the results of the experiments.

4.1 Local constant regression

Consider the following quadratic likelihood function reweighted with the kernel functions K(∑) :

L(, x, h) d=ef - 1 2

n
i=1(Yi

-

)2wi(x,

h),

wi(x, h) d=ef K({x - Xi}/h),

K(x)  [0, 1], K(x)dx = 1, K(x) = K(-x).
IR

Here h > 0 denotes bandwidth, the local smoothing parameter. The target point and

the local MLE read as:

(x, h) d=ef

n i=1

wi(x,

h)IE

n i=1

wi(x,

h)

Yi

,

(x, h) d=ef

n i=1

wi(x,

n i=1

.

Let us fix a bandwidth h and consider the range of points x1, . . . , xK . They yield K local constant models with the target parameters k d=ef (xk, h) and the likelihood functions Lk() d=ef L(, xk, h) for k = 1, . . . , K .
The bootstrap local likelihood function is defined similarly to the global one (2.2), by
reweighting L(, x, h) with the bootstrap multipliers u1, . . . , un :

4.3 Simulated data

In the numerical experiments we constructed two 90% simultaneous confidence bands: using Monte Carlo (MC) samples and bootstrap procedure with Gaussian weights ( ui  N (1, 1) ), in each case we used 104 {Yi} and 104 {ui} independent samples. The sample size n = 400 . K(x) is Epanechnikov's kernel function. The independent random observations Yi are generated as follows:

Yi = f (Xi) + N (0, 1), Xi are equidistant on [0, 1],


5,   
f (x) = 5 + 3.8{1 - 100(x - 0.35)2},
  5 - 3.8{1 - 100(x - 0.55)2},

x  [0, 0.25]  [0.65, 1]; x  [0.25, 0.45]; x  [0.45, 0.65].

(4.1) (4.2)

The number of local models K = 71 , the points x1, . . . , x71 are equidistant on [0, 1] . For the bandwidth we considered two cases: h = 0.12 and h = 0.3 .

4.4 Effect of the modeling bias on a width of a bootstrap confidence band
The function f (x) defined in (4.2) should yield a considerable modeling bias for both mean constant and mean quadratic estimators. Figures 4.1, 4.2 demonstrate that the bootstrap confidence bands become conservative (i.e. wider than the MC confidence

18 Simultaneous bootstrap confidence sets

band) when the local model is misspecified. The top graphs on Figures 4.1, 4.2 show the 90% confidence bands, the middle graphs show their width, and the bottom graphs show the value of the modelling bias for K = 71 local models (see formulas (4.3) and (4.4) below). For the local constant estimate (Figure 4.1) the width of the bootstrap confidence sets is considerably increased by the modeling bias when x  [0.25, 0.65] . In this case case the expression for the modeling bias term for the k -th model (see also (SmB) condition) reads as:

Hk-1Bk2Hk-1 =

n i=1

(4.3)

And for the local quadratic estimate it holds:

Hk-1Bk2Hk-1 = Ip - Hk-1

n
i=1 ii

wi2(xk, h)

Hk-1

(4.4)

where Ip is the identity matrix of dimension p ◊ p (here p = 3 ), and

wi2(xk, h)IE {Yi - (xk)}2

n
i=1 ii

wi2(xk, h) {f (Xi) - (xk)}2 +

n
i=1 ii

wi2(xk, h).

(4.5)

Therefore, if max1kK {f (Xi) - (xk)}2 = 0 , then Hk-1Bk2Hk-1 = 0 . On the Figure 4.1 both the modelling bias and the difference between the widths of the bootstrap and

MC confidence bands are close to zero in the regions where the true function f (x) is

constant. On Figure 4.2 the modelling bias for h = 0.12 is overall smaller than the

corresponding value on Figure 4.1. For the bigger bandwidth h = 0.3 the modelling

biases on Figures 4.1 and 4.2 are comparable with each other.

Thus the numerical experiment is consistent with the theoretical results from Sec-

tion 3.2, and confirm that in the case when a (local) parametric model is close to the

true distribution the simultaneous bootstrap confidence set is valid. Otherwise the boot-

strap procedure is conservative: the modelling bias widens the simultaneous bootstrap

confidence set.

4.5 Effective coverage probability (local constant estimate)
In this part of the experiment we check the bootstrap validity by computing the effective coverage probability values. This requires to perform many independent experiments: for each of independent 5000 {Yi}  (4.1) samples we took 104 independent bootstrap samples {ui}  N (1, 1) , and constructed simultaneous bootstrap confidence sets for a range of confidence levels. The second row of Table 4.1 contains this range (1 - ) =

among 5000 data samples, for the bandwidths h = 0.12, 0.3 , and for the range of (1-) .

The results show that the bootstrap procedure is rather conservative for both h = 0.12

and h = 0.3 , however, the larger bandwidth yields bigger coverage probabilities.

4.6 Correction for multiplicity
Here we compare the Y and the bootstrap corrections for multiplicity, i.e. the values c() and c ba () defined in (1.8) and (2.4). The numerical results in Tables 2, 3 are based on 104 {Yi}  (4.1) independent samples and 104 independent bootstrap samples {ui}  N (1, 1) . The second line in Tables 2, 3 contains the range of the nominal confidence levels (1 - ) = 0.95, 0.9, . . . , 0.5 (similarly to the Table 1). The first column contains the values of the bandwidth h = 0.12, 0.3 , and the second column ≠ the resampling scheme: Monte Carlo (MC) or bootstrap (B). The Monte Carlo experiment yields the corrected confidence levels 1 - c() , and the bootstrap yields 1 - c ba () . The lines 3≠6 contain the average values of 1 - c() and 1 - c ab() over all the experiments. The results show that for the smaller bandwidth both the MC and bootstrap corrections are bigger than the ones for the larger bandwidth. In the case of a smaller bandwidth the local models have less intersections with each other, and hence, the corrections for multiplicity are closer to the Bonferroni's bound.
Remark 4.1. The theoretical results of this paper can be extended to the case when a set of considered local models has cardinality of the continuum, and the confidence bands are uniform w.r.t. the local parameter. This extension would require some uniform statements such as locally uniform square-root Wilks approximation (see e.g. Spokoiny and Zhilova (2013)).
Remark 4.2. The use of the bootstrap procedure in the problem of choosing an optimal bandwidth is considered in Spokoiny and Willrich (2015).

5 Conditions
Here we show necessary conditions for the main results. The conditions in Section 5.1 come from the general finite sample theory by Spokoiny (2012a), they are required for the results of Sections B.1 and B.2. The conditions in Section 5.2 are necessary to prove the statements on multiplier bootstrap validity.

5.3 Dependence of the involved terms on the sample size and cardinality of the parameters' set

Here we consider the case of the i.i.d. observations Y1, . . . , Yn and x = C log n in order to specify the dependence of the non-asymptotic bounds on n and p . In the paper by

Spokoiny and Zhilova (2014) (the version of 2015) this is done in detail for the i.i.d. case,

generalized linear model and quantile regression. 
Example 5.1 in Spokoiny (2012a) demonstrates that in this situation gk = C n and 
k = C/ n . then Zk(x) = C pk + x for some constant C  1.85 , for the function Zk(x)

given in (B.3) in Section B.1.

large, then the value bk(r) from condition (Lr) can be taken as C{1 - r/ n}  C . Indeed, for  : Dk( - k) = r

A Approximation of the joint distributions of 2 -norms

Let us previously introduce some notations: 1K d=ef (1, . . . , 1)  IRK ;
∑ is the Euclidean norm for a vector and spectral norm for a matrix;
∑ max is the maximum of absolute values of elements of a vector or of a matrix; ∑ 1 is the sum of absolute values of elements of a vector or of a matrix.
Consider K random centered vectors k  IRpk for k = 1, . . . , K . Each vector equals to a sum of n centered independent vectors:

k = k,1 + ∑ ∑ ∑ + k,n, IEk = IEk,i = 0  1  i  n. Introduce similarly the vectors k  IRpk for k = 1, . . . , K :
k = k,1 + ∑ ∑ ∑ + k,n, IEk = IEk,i = 0  1  i  n,

with the same independence properties as k,i , and also independent of all k,i . The goal of this section is to compare the joint distributions of the 2 -norms of the
sets of vectors k and k , k = 1, . . . , K (i.e. the probability laws L ( 1 , . . . , K ) and L ( 1 , . . . , K ) ), assuming that their correlation structures are close to each other.

Remark A.1. The approximating error term  2 consists of three errors, which correspond to: the Gaussian approximation result (Lemma A.2), Gaussian comparison

(Lemma A.7), and anti-concentration inequality (Lemma A.8). The bound on  2 above implies that the number K of the random vectors 1, . . . , K should satisfy log K (n/p3max)1/12 in order to keep the approximating error term  2 small. This condition can be relaxed by using a sharper Gaussian approximation result. For instance,

using in Lemma A.2 the Slepian-Stein technique plus induction argument from the recent

paper by Chernozhukov et al. (2014b) instead of the Lindeberg's approach, would lead

to the improved bound: C

A.2 Gaussian comparison
The following Lemma shows how to compare the expected values of a twice differentiable function evaluated at the independent centered Gaussian vectors. This statement is used

36 Simultaneous bootstrap confidence sets

for the Gaussian comparison step in the scheme (3.1). The proof of the result is based on the Gaussian interpolation method introduced by Stein (1981) and Slepian (1962) (see also R®ollin (2013) and Chernozhukov et al. (2013b) and references therein). The proof is given here in order to keep the text self-contained.

Lemma A.7 (Gaussian comparison using Slepian interpolation). Let the IRpsum -dimensional random centered vectors  and  be independent and normally distributed, f (Z) : IRpsum  IR is any twice differentiable function s.t. the expected values in the expression below are bounded. Then it holds

Zt

d=ef

  t+ 1-t



IRpsum ,

(t) d=ef IEf (Z(t)),

then IEf () = (1) , IEf ( ) = (0) and

IEf () - IEf ( ) = |(1) - (0)|   (t) dt.

Let us consider  (t) :

d  (t) = dt IEf (Zt) = IE

{f (Zt)}

d dt Zt

= 1 IE 2t

 f (Zt)

-  1 IE 2 1-t



f (Zt)

.

(A.18)

Further we use the Gaussian integration by parts formula (see e.g Section A.6 in Talagrand (2003)): if (x1, . . . , xpsum) is a centered Gaussian vector and f (x1, . . . , xpsum) is s.t. the integrals below exist, then it holds for all j = 1, . . . , psum :

psum
IE {xjf (x1, . . . , xpsum)} = IE(xjxk)IE

B Square-root Wilks approximations
This section's goal is to derive square root Wilks approximations simultaneously for K parametric models, for the Y and bootstrap worlds. This is done in Section B.3 below. Both of the results are used in the approximating scheme (3.1) for the bootstrap justification. In order to make the text self-contained we recall in Section B.1 some results from the general finite sample theory by Spokoiny (2012a,b, 2013). In Section B.2 we recall similar finite sample results for the bootstrap world for a single parametric model, obtained in Spokoiny and Zhilova (2014).

B.1 Finite sample theory

Let us use the notations given in the introduction: Lk() , k = 1, . . . , K are the loglikelihood processes, which depend on the data Y and correspond to the regular parametric families of probability distributions {IPk(),   k  IRpk } . The general finite sample approach by Spokoiny (2012a) does not require that the true distribution IP of
the data Y belongs to any of the parametric families {IPk()} . The target parameters k are defined as in (1.3) by projection of the true measure IP on {IPk()} . Let Dk2 denote the full Fisher information pk ◊ pk matrices, which are deterministic, symmetric and positive-definite:

Dk2 d=ef -2IELk(k).

Centered pk -dimensional random vectors k denote the normalised scores: k d=ef Dk-1Lk(k).
Introduce the following elliptic vicinities around the true points k : 0,k(r) d=ef {  k : Dk( - k)  r} .

Let 1  k  K be fixed. The non-asymptotic Wilks approximating bound by Spokoiny
(2012a, 2013) requires that the maximum likelihood estimate k gets into the local vicinity 0,k(r0,k) of some radius r0,k > 0 with probability  1 - 3e-x , x > 0 . This is guaranteed by the following concentration result:

Theorem B.1 (Concentration of the MLE, Spokoiny (2013)). Let the conditions (ED0) , (ED2) , (L0) , (I) and (Lr) be fulfilled. If for each k = 1, . . . , K for the constants r0,k > 0 and for the functions bk(r) from (Lr) holds:

bk(r)r  2 Zqf(x, IBk) + 6kk Zk(x + log(2r/r0,k)) , r > r0,k

(B.1)

zhilova, m.

43

where the functions Zk(x) and Zqf(x, IBk) are defined in (B.3) and (B.4) respectively, then it holds for all k = 1, . . . , K

IP k / 0,k(r0,k)  3e-x.

The constants k, k and ak come from the imposed conditions (ED0) ≠ (I) (from 
Section 5). In the case 5.3 r0,k  C pk + x .

Theorem B.2 (Wilks approximation, Spokoiny (2013)). Under the conditions of The-
orem B.1 for some r0,k > 0 s.t. (B.1) is fulfilled, it holds for each k = 1, . . . , K with probability  1 - 5e-x

The constants gk and k(r) come from the imposed conditions (ED0) , (L0) (from Section 5). The function Zqf(x, IBk) , defined in (B.4), corresponds to the quantile function of deviations of the approximating random value k (see Theorem B.3 below).

The following theorem characterizes the tail behaviour of the approximating terms k 2 . It means that with bounded exponential moments of the vectors k (conditions (ED0) , (I) ) its squared Euclidean norms k 2 have three regimes of deviations: sub-Gaussian, Poissonian and large-deviations' zone.

Theorem B.3 (Deviation bound for a random quadratic form, Spokoiny (2012b)). Let condition (ED0) be fulfilled, then for gk  2 tr(IBk2) it holds for each k = 1, . . . , K :
IP k 2  Zq2f(x, IBk)  2e-x + 8.4e-xc,k ,

C Proofs of the main results
Before proving the statements from Section 3.2 we formulate below the Bernstein matrix inequality, which is necessary for the further proofs.
