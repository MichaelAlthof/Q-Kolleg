Abstract: We consider a special class of multiple testing problems, consisting of M simultaneous point hypothesis tests in local statistical experiments. Under certain structural assumptions the global hypothesis contains exactly one element  (say), and  is least favourable parameter configuration with respect to the family-wise error rate (FWER) of multiple single-step tests, meaning that the FWER of such tests becomes largest under .
Furthermore, it turns out that concepts of positive dependence are applicable to the involved test statistics in many practically relevant cases, in particular, for multivariate normal and chi-squared distributions. Altogether, this allows for a relaxation of the adjustment for multiplicity by making use of the intrinsic correlation structure in the data. We represent product-type bounds for the FWER in terms of a relaxed Sida´k-type correction of the overall significance level and compute "effective numbers of tests".
Our methodology can be applied to a variety of simultaneous location parameter problems, as in analysis of variance models or in the context of simultaneous categorical data analysis. For example, simultaneous chisquare tests for association of categorical features are ubiquitous in genomewide association studies. In this type of model, Moskvina and Schmidt (2008) gave a formula for an effective number of tests utilizing Pearson's haplotypic correlation coefficient as a linkage disequilibrium measure. Their result follows as a corollary from our general theory and will be generalized.

1. Introduction

Simultaneous statistical inference and, in particular, multiple statistical hypoth-

esis testing has become a major branch of mathematical and applied statistics

during the past 20 years, cf. [1] for some bibliometric details. This growing in-

terest is not least due to the novel challenges posed by the need to analyze

ultra high-dimensional data from genetic applications. Consider, for instance,

genome-wide association studies. In these, it is common to evaluate hundreds of

thousands of genetic markers simultaneously with respect to their association

with a given phenotype. For the theory of multiple tests, one major resulting

problem is that many classical multiple test procedures or, equivalently, the

corresponding adjustments for multiplicity of the overall significance level lead

to extremely small local significance levels if (strong) control of the family-wise

error rate (FWER) is targeted. This implies extremely low power for detecting

true effects. In [2], it was proposed to relax the type I error criterion, to allow for

a few false rejections and to control the expected proportion of false significances.

The mathematical formalization of this idea, the false discovery rate (FDR) has

proven attractive for practitioners and the so-called "Benjamini-Hochberg cor-

rection" can meanwhile be found in many statistical software packages. However,

in cases with strong dependencies among test statistics or p-values, respectively,

it has been shown that, even for large systems of hypotheses, the false discovery

proportion (FDP) is typically not well concentrated around its expectation, the

FDR (see, for example, [11] for the case of positively dependent, exchangeable

test statistics). Consequently, FDR control in such a setting does not imply any

type I error control guarantee for the actual experiment at hand, although pos-

itive dependency in the sense of multivariate total positivity of order 2 (MTP2)

or positive regression dependency on subsets (PRDS) ensures FDR-control of

the linear step-up test proposed in [2], as proved independently in [3] and [21].

Such a counter-intuitive behavior cannot occur for FWER-controlling single-

step tests, the main objects of the present work. As shown in [20], the MTP2

property is also useful for control of the FWER. More specifically, the critical val-

ues introduced by Simes ([23]) can be used as the basis for an FWER-controlling

closed test procedure, provided that the joint distribution of test statistics or

p-values, respectively, is MTP2. This result allows to improve a closed Bonfer-

roni test uniformly. However, the result is generic in the sense that, apart from

MTP2, no further (concrete) properties of the multivariate joint distribution of

test statistics are exploited.

We will demonstrate how finer-grained knowledge about the second- (or

higher-) order positive dependency structure of the underlying joint distribu-

tion of test statistics can be utilized to establish a non-trivial lower bound for

the amount of possible multiplicity adjustment relaxation in comparison with

the independent case. This will mathematically be formalized by the "effective

"effective number of tests" is already used for a longer time in the context of genetic epidemiology and genome-wide association studies (cf. our bibliographic references in Section 4), but a formal mathematical foundation of it is yet lacking.
In this work, we will restrict attention to two-sided marginal tests, because corresponding test statistics often exhibit positive correlations, even if their counterparts for the one-sided case are negatively correlated. Especially, we will be considered with distributions that are monotonically sub-Markovian with respect to lower orthants in the sense of [4].
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we set up the necessary notational framework and introduce important structural properties regarding multiple point hypothesis test problems (MPHTPs), multiple tests and multivariate distributions. Section 3 shows how these properties can be combined to calculate the effective number of tests of degree i. Applications of this general theory are provided in Section 4. We conclude with a discussion in Section 5. Our own contributions will be denoted as theorems, while we label reported results from the literature as propositions.

2. Notation and Preliminaries

Throughout the work, we let (X , F , (P)) denote a statistical experiment and (S, S) a measurable space with S a subset of R. We identify hypotheses

with non-empty subsets of the parameter space . The tuple (X , F , (P), H) denotes a multiple test problem, where H = (Hi, 1  i  M ) defines a finite family of null hypotheses. We fix the cardinality M of H for the remainder of

the work and suppress it notationally wherever possible to increase readability.

The resulting alternative hypotheses are denoted by Ki =  \ Hi, 1  i  M .

The intersection hypothesis H0 =

M i=1

Hi

will

occasionally

be

referred

to

as

global hypothesis. For a given   , we will denote the index set of true null

hypotheses in H by I0  I0() = {1  i  M :   Hi}. A (non-randomized) multiple test is a measurable mapping  = (i)1iM : X  {0, 1}M the components of which have the usual interpretation of a statistical test for Hi

versus Ki. The family-wise error rate, FWER for short, of a multiple test  is (for a given   ) defined as the probability under  of at least one type I

error, i. e., FWER() = P iI0(){i = 1} and  is said to control the
FWER at a pre-specified level   (0, 1) if sup FWER()  . Under this general framework, our main objects of interest are defined as
follows.

Definition 2.1 (MPHTP, VOLTS and SCRAT). Assume that (X , F , (P)) can be decomposed into local statistical experiments in the sense that there exist statistical experiments (Xj, Fj, (Pj )jj )1jM such that

where j : (X , F )  (Xj, Fj) denotes the projection on the j-th coordinate. Then we call

a) (X , F , (P), H) a multiple point hypothesis testing problem (MPHTP), if for all 1  j  M we have Hj = {   | j = j} for pre-defined values j , and H0 contains exactly one element  = (1, . . . , M )  .
b) T = (T1, . . . , TM ) a vector of local test statistics (VOLTS), if j  {1, . . . , M }, Tj : (Xj, Fj)  (S, S) is a measurable mapping.
c)   (T ) = (1, . . . , M ) a single-step componentwise rectangular rejection area test (SCRAT) defined by T , if T is a VOLTS and j 
{1, . . . , M } there exist rectangles j := {s  S | s > cj} for fixed constants c1, . . . , cM  S such that j = 1j (Tj) = 1(cj,)(Tj). We denote by Oj := {j = 0} = {Tj  cj} the event that Hj is not rejected.

MPHTPs appear naturally in various statistical applications. For instance, by means of appropriate (re-) parametrization, multiple comparisons with a control group (Dunnett contrasts) and all pairwise comparisons (Tukey contrasts) under the one-factorial analysis of variance model can be formalized as MPHTPs. A leading example for our further considerations is a multiple (two-sided) homogeneity test problem for many contingency tables, which is ubiquitous in genetic association studies with case-control setup (association between many genetic markers and a categorical or binary phenotype). In such a case, often a SCRAT (based on a multivariate chi-square distributed VOLTS) is performed. We will provide more details on the latter situation in Section 4.
In order to maintain a self-contained presentation, we now briefly recall some concepts of positive dependency for multivariate probability distributions.

Definition 2.2 (Concepts of positive dependence). Let (X , F, P) be a probability space and let T = (T1, . . . , TM ) : X  SM be a random vector. In all definitions below, t = (t1, . . . , tM ) denotes an arbitrary element of SM .

k,k  k,i  k,i-1  ...  k,1 for k  i and k,k  k,k-1  ...  k,1 for i > k  1, entailing PM  i  i-1  ...  1.

In other words, PLOD is equivalent to PM  1.
(iii) T is called multivariate totally positive of order 2 (MTP2), if its distribution PT on (SM , SM ) has a probability density function (pdf ) f : SM  [0, ) with respect to a measure M , such that for all u, v  SM :

f (u) · f (v)  f (min(u, v)) · f (max(u, v)),

where the minimum or maximum, respectively, is being taken componentwise. (iv) T is called positive regression dependent on a subset I0 of the set of indices {1, . . . , M } (PRDS on I0), if for every increasing set D  SM and for every index i  I0
P(T  D | Ti = u) is non-decreasing in u.
Therein, the set D is called increasing if u1  D and u2  u1 (jointly) imply u2  D.
As outlined in the introduction, the MTP2 and PRDS properties have been investigated deeply in connection with test statistics for multiple test problems in previous literature. For instance, it is well-known that MTP2 implies PRDS on any subset and that PRDS in turn implies FWER control or FDR control, respectively, of classical multiple test procedures. In Section 3, we will make use of the MSMi property and demonstrate its relevance for computing the effective number of tests.
Checking PRDS and MSMi in practice can be very cumbersome, because the conditional probabilities occurring in these definitions are often hard to handle. The MTP2 property is often more convenient to deal with. The following proposition shows that there exists a hierarchy in the concepts of positive dependence introduced in parts (i) - (iii) of Definition 2.2.
Proposition 2.1. Under the assumptions of Definition 2.2, it holds
(i) MTP2 implies MSMM-1. (ii) MSMi implies MSMh for all 1  h  i. In particular, MSMi for i  2
implies PLOD.
Proof. The assertions under (ii) are obvious and the assertion under (i) has been proven in [13].
Finally, we recall the following additional condition regarding the (joint) distribution of the vector of test statistics which has been introduced and extensively been made use of in [25] for resampling.
Definition 2.3 (Subset pivotality condition). Under our general framework, assume that the global hypothesis H0 is non-empty. Let T = (T1, . . . , TM ) : (X , F ) - (SM , SM ) be a vector of test statistics (not necessarily a VOLTS). Then, T is said to satisfy the subset pivotality condition (SPC), if

where the subvector TI0() corresponds to the indices of true hypotheses in H under   .

in the sense mentioned in the introduction can be computed if the structural as-

sumptions SCRAT, SPC and MSMi can be established. Section 4 will exemplify

practically relevant situations where this is the case.

3. General Theory
As in ordinary, one-dimensional test problems with composite null hypotheses, for strong control of the FWER it is helpful to determine the "worst case situation", i. e., the parameter value(s) for which the FWER becomes largest. Any such parameter value is called a least favorable parameter configuration (LFC). Our first result is concerned with finding the LFC in our setup. Lemma 3.1 states that for an MPHTP with the structural properties given in (1) weak control (under H0) of the FWER is equivalent to strong control (under any arbitrary   ) of the FWER. In other words, the LFC is located in H0.
Lemma 3.1. Let (X , F , (P), H) be an MPHTP with intersection hypothesis H0 = {}. Let T : (X , F ) - (SM , SM ) be a VOLTS which satisfies the SPC.
Then  is the unique LFC for any SCRAT  = (1, . . . , M ) defined by T with respect to the FWER, i. e.,
   : FWER()  FWER ().
Proof. Let    be an arbitrary parameter value with resulting index set of true hypotheses I0  I0(). Since  is a SCRAT, the event that none of the true hypotheses is falsely rejected only depends on TI0  TI0(). Let OI0 =
iI0() Oi, with Oi as in Definition 2.1.(c). Utilizing the SPC, we obtain

P(OI0 ) = PTI0 and, consequently,

= P (OI0 ),



FWER() = 1 - P(OI0 ) = 1 - P (OI0 ) = P 

{i = 1} .

From the fact that I0()  {1, . . . , M }, we conclude

Our main theorem connects all assumptions and provides a formula for computing effective numbers of tests.

Theorem 3.1 (Effective numbers of tests). Under the assumptions of Lemma 3.1, let T fulfill the MSMi property for some i  1 under . Define cut-offs c = (c1, . . . , cM )  SM such that j  {1, . . . , M } : Pj ( = 1) = Pj (Tj > cj) = loc. for a fixed local significance level loc.  (0, 1) in each marginal.
(i) In case of i  2, set (i) = 0. Otherwise, let

Moreover, for every i  j  M , define

j(i)



(ji)(loc.; T1, . . . , Tj )

log(j,i(c)) log(1 -  )loc.

where the probability measure P is used in all j,j(c). Next, notice that P (Oj) = 1 - loc. for all 1  j  M . Application of MSMi

completing the proof of part (i). Part (ii) is then obvious.

Remark 3.1.

(i) The numbers ((ji))jM=2 quantify the "degree of positive dependency" between the components of T . In particular, if T consists of jointly indepen-

dent local test statistics, all (ji) are equal to one (all M marginal tests

"fully

count")

and

we

have

M (i) eff.

=

M.

The

same

holds

true

if

i

=

1.

This special case has already been considered in [22]. On the other hand,

if all Tj, 1  j  M , are perfectly correlated in the sense that for all

2  j  M : j,i(c) = 1 leading to (ji) = 0, "effectively" only one single

test

is

performed

and

we

have

M (i) eff.

=

1.

Obviously,

in

the

general

case

we

have

(ii) For FWER control at a pre-specified (overall) significance level  in practi-

cal applications (assuming, for the moment, fixed given values of the (ji)), Theorem 3.1 suggests the following algorithm: (i) Start with a reasonable

upper

bound

for

 ,loc.

(ii)

Iteratively,

compute

M (i) eff.

and

decrease

the

value

for  ,loc. until the bound in (3) equals .

(iii) Since P2 = 2 in the case of M = 2, inequality (3) is an equality for

M = i = 2, even without any assumptions on the dependency structure

between the components of T . We will use this fact in Example 3.1 below.

Example 3.1. In order to illustrate the importance of the two-sidedness of the

marginal test problems for our theory, let us consider the very simple example of

two simultaneous Z-tests. More specifically, consider M = 2 and two normally

distributed random variables Z1 and Z2, where Z = (Z1, Z2)  N2(µ, ),

with unknown mean vector µ, but known covariance matrix  =

,

|| < 1. Moreover, let µ = (µ1, µ2)  R2. In the two-sided case, we let H = (H1, H2) with point hypotheses H1 = {(µ1, µ2)  R2| µ1 = µ1}, H2 = {(µ1, µ2)  R2| µ2 = µ2}. In this case, a suitable SCRAT at local significance

level loc. is given by  = (1, 2), where j = 1(c,)(|Zj - µj|), j = 1, 2, with c = -1(1 - loc./2) and  denoting the cumulative distribution function (cdf )
of the standard normal distribution. Letting Tj = |Zj - µj|, it is easy to show that

Simple calculus yields that  is decreasing in ||, with maximum (0) = 1 and infimum lim||1 () = 0. Consequently, for the multiple test  we get

loc.  FWERµ () = 1 - (1 - loc.)1+()  1 - (1 - loc.)2,

with equalities if and only if Z1 =D Z2, or Z1 and Z2 are stochastically independent, respectively. Plainly phrased, this means that any non-zero correlation  allows an improvement of the Sida´k-corrected local significance level in this
two-sided case. This calculation may be regarded as a proof for the fact that the
absolute values of any bivariate normal distribution are positive quadrant depen-
dent (i. e., PLOD) for the special case that both quadrant bounds are identical. Contrarily, consider the two one-sided hypotheses Hj : {µj  µj } and, conse-
quently, Kj : {µj > µj}, j = 1, 2. Now, one would choose as a suitable SCRAT at local significance level loc. the test  = (1, 2), where j = 1(c,)(Zj - µj), j = 1, 2, with c = -1(1 - loc.). Clearly, our theory does not apply here, and
negative values of  even require a stronger multiplicity correction for control of the FWER than in the Sida´k case, where we have loc. = 1 - (1 - )1/2. To see this, consider the case µ = µ in the global hypothesis (which is not simple in the one-sided case). We obtain, with Tj = Zj - µj, j = 1, 2, that

FWERµ () = Pµ ({T1 > c}  {T2 > c}) = 1 - FN2(0,)(c, c) = h() (say).

Here, we get lim1 h() =  ,loc. while we have lim-1 h() = 2loc., hence, in the worst case, even a Bonferroni correction (setting loc. = /2) is necessary.

Of course, Example 3.1 is not convincing for applying our theory, because the

full joint distribution of the test statistics under H0 is available in explicit form

and, consequently, the exact calculation of the value of loc. required for FWER control would in practice not take the detours via our Sida´k-type bound making

4. Applications

4.1. Genetic association studies

In genetic association studies, a (often large) number M of positions on the human genome is simultaneously tested with respect to their association with a binary outcome (typically, a disease indicator). One study design is the casecontrol design, which retrospectively samples a fixed number n1. of cases (diseased individuals) and n2. healthy controls. We denote the total sample size by n = n1. + n2.. Technically, the genetic positions 1  j  M are marked by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A SNP can be described by a pair of two alleles A1, A2  {A, C, G, T } (the single bases on the two strands of deoxyribonucleic acid at this position). Here, we restrict attention to bi-allelic SNPs, meaning that exactly two of the four letters A, C, G, T are possible at every position under investigation.
We start with a rather simple disease model, assuming that presence of one allele (the risk allele) alone may already confer an increased disease risk. This leads to high-dimensional categorical data analysis in (2×2) contingency tables. In Definition 4.1, we make the convention that the table rows correspond to the binary disease status (diseased / healthy) and the columns to the allele types (risk allele / wild type allele). In order to keep notation feasible, we abuse it a little bit in Definition 4.1 and denote the number of observational units (alleles) in the study, in the subsample of cases and in the subsample of controls, respectively, by n, n1. and n2..

Definition 4.1 (Multiple allelic association test problem). Consider an MPHTP

with local statistical experiments (Xj, Fj, (Pj )jj )1jM , such that Xj =

N2×2 and Fj = 2Xj . An observation xj =

x1(j1) x2(j1)

x(1j2) x(2j2)

 Xj necessarily

fulfills x(1j1) + x1(j2) = n1. and x(2j1) + x2(j2) = n2. by experimental design. Denoting

the multinomial distribution with c categories, sample size n and vector of prob-

abilities p by Mc(n, p), we have that, for every j, the pair of random variables
(X1(j1), X1(j2)) is distributed as M2(n1., pj), with pj = (p1j, p2j) taking the role of j in our general setup. The point hypothesis Hj that we are concerned with is

then given by pj = Pj, where Pj = (P1j, P2j) denotes the vector of (expected)

allele frequencies at position j in the entire population (which is unknown in

practice). We refer to this MPHTP as a multiple allelic association test prob-

lem. Letting n(.1j) = x(1j1) + x2(j1), n.(2j) = x1(j2) + x(2j2), p^1j = n.(1j)/n, p^2j = n.(2j)/n, a VOLTS for this MPHTP is given by T = (T1, . . . , TM ) with

Such multiple allelic association test problems have already been considered

in [18] with respect to the effective number of tests. As a preparation for our

investigations regarding the genotypic test problem below, we briefly summarize

how to compute effective numbers of tests for a multiple allelic association test

problem. To this end, it is convenient to formalize the problem from a slightly

different perspective: In principle, 2M haplotypes (combinations of all M SNP-

wise alleles) are possible. We assume that the (expected) haplotype frequencies

in the population can be described by a probability measure  on {1, . . . , 2M },

with   ({}) denoting the probability that a randomly chosen individual

exhibits haplotype . Without loss of generality, assume that  > 0 for 1   

h with

h =1

for

some

2M .

Let

A(j)

denote

the

set

of

haplotypes

which imply the risk allele (corresponding to the first column in the (2×2)-table)

at position j. Then, P1j = 1 - P2j = A(j) . By Sn,, 1    h, we denote the random number of individuals in the sample
with haplotype  and set Sn = (Sn,1, . . . , Sn,h) with values in Nh. Analogously, we use the notation Sn1. = (Sn1.,1, . . . , Sn1.,h) if only the sub-sample of cases is considered.

populations).

Proof. Part (i) is obvious. Part (ii) is due to Section 30.1 in [8]. Part (iii) is a condensed version of Appendix A in [18] and part (iv) immediately follows from part (iii) and the construction of the vectors vj in [18].

Proposition 4.1. Let X = (X1, . . . , XM ) denote a centered multivariate Gaussian random vector, X  NM (0, ) with  positive definite and let |X| = (|X1|, . . . , |XM |).

(i) Independently of , |X| is PLOD.
(ii) |X| is MTP2 if and only if there exists a diagonal matrix D with diagonal elements ±1 such that the off-diagonal elements of -D-1D are all non-

for Tj = Xj2, 1  j  M , if all tj > 0, 1  j  M , are identical and equal to u (say). Furthermore, the optimized version M¯ e(ff2.) of the effective
number of tests of degree 2 is applicable in this case.

have that every pair (|Xk|, |X|) is PLOD. This entails 2  1, even without the extra assumption on t. Moreover, in Appendix A in [18] it is stated that for

In the remainder of this section, we will demonstrate that our methodology also applies for genotypic association tests, in which the allele pairs forming the SNPs are analyzed instead of the risk alleles alone. This leads to analyzing

Dickhaus, Stange/MPHTPs and effective numbers of tests

13

many (2 × 3) contingency tables simultaneously. Thereby, the two rows again correspond to the phenotypic (disease) status and the three columns now conventionally refer to A1A1 (column 1), A1A2 (column 2) and A2A2, where A1 denotes the minor allele (less prevalent in the population) and A2 the major allele at the respective genetic position. As we will see, this requires a non-obvious extension of the considerations for multiple allelic association test problems. Moreover, in contrast to the allelic tests considered before, in Definition 4.2 every observational unit is one individual.

Definition 4.2 (Multiple genotypic association test problem). Consider an

MPHTP with local statistical experiments (Xj, Fj, (Pj )jj )1jM , such that

Xj = N2×3 and Fj = 2Xj . An observation xj =

x(1j1) x2(j1)

x(1j2) x(2j2)

x1(j3) x(2j3)

 Xj

fulfills x1(j1) + x(1j2) + x(1j3) = n1. and x(2j1) + x(2j2) + x2(j3) = n2. by experimental design. For every j, the triple of random variables (X1(j1), X1(j2), X1(j3)) is distributed as M3(n1., pj), with unknown parameter vector pj = (p1j, p2j, p3j). The point hy-

pothesis Hj that we are concerned with is then given by pj = Pj = (P1j, P2j, P3j),

where Pj denotes the vector of expected genotype frequencies at position j in the

entire population. We refer to this MPHTP as a multiple genotypic association

test problem. As in Definition 4.1, we let n(.1j) = x(1j1) + x(2j1), n.(2j) = x1(j2) + x2(j2), n.(3j) = x(1j3) + x2(j3), and p^ij = n.(ij)/n, i = 1, 2, 3. A VOLTS for this MPHTP is given by T = (T1, . . . , TM ) where for all 1  j  M :

Tj

=

(X1(j1) - n1.p^1j )2 n1.p^1j

.

Under Hj, Tj is asymptotically (n  ) 22-distributed, and we have a SCRAT at asymptotic local significance level  ,loc. given by  = (j : 1  j  M ) with j = 1(c,)(Tj ), where c = F-221(1 - loc.).

In analogy to the allelic case, 3M haplotypes (combinations of all M SNPs)

with respect to allele pairs are possible (in principle). Again, we assume a prob-

ability measure  on {1, . . . , 3M } with  > 0 for 1    g and

g =1



=

for some g  3M to formalize genotypic haplotype probabilities. From this, we

can deduce the genotype probabilities for SNP j as

Pij =

In (8), B1(j), B2(j) and B3(j), respectively, denote the sets of haplotypes implying the genotype A1A1, A1A2 and A2A2, respectively, at position j. Furthermore, we make use of the notations Sn,, 1    g, Sn, and Sn1. = (Sn1.,1, . . . , Sn1.,g) in corresponding manner as in the allelic situation.

and put v1(j) = Cw1(j) {||Cw1(j)||}-1, v2(j) = Cw2(j) {||Cw2(j)||}-1. Then, we have

= Z2,j (say).

Moreover, for n  , we obtain that, under Hj, (Z1,j, Z2,j) D (Z1, Z2)
with (Z1, Z2)  N2(0, E2) and Tj D Z12 + Z22. (iii) Under the global hypothesis H0, it holds for all 1  j, k  M : For any tuple

Proof. Part (i) and representation (9) are in analogy to parts (i) and (ii) in Lemma 4.1. The validity of the representations (10) and (11) can easily be verified by making use of (8), (9) and noticing that n1., Cwi(j) = n1., wi(j) , i = 1, 2, ||Cw1(j)||2 = ||w1(j)||2 - , w1(j) = P1j - P12j and ||Cw2(j)||2 = ||w2(j)||2 - , w2(j) = P2j(1 - P1j)(1 - P1j - P2j). The remainder of part (ii) is an application of the central limit theorem. Finally, part (iii) follows by the asymptotic result in part (i), together with linearity of Gaussian distributions.

Remark 4.1. The correlations rj,k(, m) in (12) only depend on the expected genotype frequencies Pij, Pik, i = 1, 2, 3 and the second-order joint probabilities of genotype pairs, given in Table 1. This entails validity of the SPC for a multiple

genotypic association test problem.
Proposition 4.2. Let T = (T1, . . . , TM ) follow a multivariate central chisquared distribution with  degrees of freedom in every marginal and with covariance matrix  in the sense of Definition 3.5.7 in [24], where all diagonal elements of  are equal to 1.
(i) Independently of the off-diagonal elements of , T is PLOD. (ii) Under exchangeability (entailing equi-correlation), T is MTP2.
Proof. To prove part (i), we notice that the distribution of T is equal to the joint distribution of the diagonal elements S1,1, . . . , SM,M of a Wishart-distributed random matrix S  WM (, ). Corollary 4.1 in [9] yields the assertion. Part (ii) is a consequence of Example 3.5. in [15].
Finally, let us calculate the optimized values ¯(j2) of degree 2, defined in (5), in the context of the MPHTP given in Definition 4.2. To this end, let p denote the unique parameter value in H0 and notice that for all 2  j  M and for all k < j:

Pp (Tj  c, Tk 1 - loc.

where 22(2, ) denotes the bivariate chi-squared distribution with two degrees of freedom in both marginals and with correlation coefficient  between the two
marginal chi-squared variates. The cdf of 22(2, ) is available in closed form, see, for instance, formula (4.2) in [14]. From this, it is easy to check that F22(2,)(c, c)

Dickhaus, Stange/MPHTPs and effective numbers of tests

16

is isotone in . Therefore, the maximum in (5) for any 2  j  M is attained for index k = arg maxk<j (Tj, Tk) and we obtain

log 2  j  M : ¯j(2) =

F22(2,(Tj ,Tk ))(c, c) log(1 - loc.)

- 1.

Remark 4.2. Various attempts to determine the "effective dimensionality" of a multivariate chi-squared distribution have been discussed in the literature before. Already in 1954, G. E. P. Box (see [6]) determined the "effective degrees of freedom" h = h(T ) of a sum of correlated chi-squared variates T = (T1, . . . , Tr), see Theorem 3.1 in that paper. A linearized version of h has been proposed in [7] and [19] as an effective number of tests in the context of genetic epidemiology. However, the argumentation in the two latter papers is based on a heuristic without formal mathematical arguments. Moreover, the resulting values of the effective number of tests according to the method of [7] and [19] are in practice typically much larger than M¯ e(ff2.) from Theorem 3.1, as demonstrated in [18]. Therefore, the method from [7] and [19] can not be recommended.

4.2. Further possible applications
Of course, multivariate normal and chi-squared distributions do not only appear in statistical genetics, but are ubiquitous in various applications. The reasoning in Example 3.1 can be applied to all kinds of multiple (two-sided) test problems for high-dimensional location parameters under asymptotic normality. In such a case, even if the correlation structure is known, it may not be feasible to derive exact thresholds for FWER control, because the necessary high-dimensional integrals are numerically intractable. For example, the R-package mvtnorm computes multivariate t- and normal probabilities up to dimension 1000, but not for higher dimensions. Therefore, it will often be more convenient to work with the second- (or higher) order approximation given by the computation of the effective number of tests of appropriate degree. We may mention here that our methodology also applies for certain cases with unknown (marginal) variances, because MTP2 characterizations for multivariate t-distributions are also available in the literature.
In [10], an application of the multivariate chi-squared distribution in the context of multiple likelihood ratio tests for linear hypotheses is demonstrated. If the asymptotic correlation structure of such likelihood ratio statistics can be deduced as, for example, in [16], our method can readily be applied in that context, too. Multiple tests for Gaussian variances constitute another application field in which our methods can be applied in total analogy to the considerations in Section 4.1.
The MTP2 property is well studied for a long time now and necessary and sufficient conditions for its validity have been derived for a variety of distributional classes. Proposition 2.1 yields that for all such MTP2 distributions the product-type probability bounds of any degree apply and the precision of approximation is in such cases mainly limited by computational restrictions.

5. Discussion and Outlook

Of course, it is mathematically unsatisfactory that PM  2  1 can only be

established under specific assumptions regarding the covariance structure within

the framework of a multiple genotypic association test problem as presented in

Definition 4.2. In high dimensions (M  5 × 105 or even M  106 is typical

in genome-wide association studies), these assumptions are impossible to check

in practice. However, Proposition 4.2.(i) at least guarantees that PM  1.

Moreover, the positive quadrant properties implied by Propositions 4.2.(i) yield

2  1 in this case, too. Since 2 is explicitly available in this case via the

bivariate chi-squared cdf, one may work with 2 although there is no theoretical

guarantee that the FWER is kept, because the "true" effective number of tests

may

lie

between

M (2) eff.

and

M.

The

findings

of

a

genome-wide

association

study

have to be replicated independently by means of a subsequent study anyway in

most cases, such that the genetics community is willing to resort on notions of

effective numbers of tests that are not proved to control the FWER strictly in

all cases.

Moreover, it seems that general characterizations of the validity of the MSMi property for i  2 in the case of absolute multivariate normal distributions are

still an open problem. This has been mentioned in the discussion of [5] and a

related remark can be found in [12]. In view of Proposition 2.1, it may be con-

jectured that subsequently sharper assumptions on the covariance structure are

necessary to establish the MSMi property for increasing i  2. It is interesting

that these problems are closely related to the Gaussian correlation conjecture,

see Section 2.4 in [17] and references therein.

Future research should address the obvious question of how to modify our

proposed effective numbers of tests in cases where the correlation structure itself

has to be estimated from data. In such a case, the two inferential problems

(estimation of the dependency structure / multiple testing) have to be solved

in parallel. This is a general topic in modern multiple testing research.
