1 Introduction
On a filtered probability space, the filtration of which is generated by a d-dimensional Brownian motion, we want to give conditions ensuring that the set A(, g), consisting of all supersolutions (Y, Z) of a backward stochastic differential equation with terminal condition  and generator g, has a minimal element. Recall that such a supersolution is a pair (Y, Z) such that, for 0  s  t  T ,

is satisfied. We call Y the value process and Z the control process of the supersolution (Y, Z). We start by considering the process Eg() defined as
Etg() = ess inf Yt  L0(Ft) : (Y, Z)  A(, g) , t  [0, T ] ,
and show that, under suitable conditions on the generator and the terminal condition, Eg() is already the value process of the unique minimal supersolution, that is, there is a unique control process Z^ such

that (Eg(), Z^)  A(, g). It was recently shown in Drapeau et al. [6] that, if the generator g is jointly lower semicontinuous in y and z, convex in z, monotone in y, and bounded below by an affine function of z, a unique minimal supersolution exists. Their proof was based on convex combinations of a monotone decreasing sequence of càdlàg supermartingales converging pointwise to Eg() on the rationals and made use of compactness results for sequences of martingales given in Delbaen and Schachermayer [3]. We follow a different approach to show the existence of a unique minimal supersolution. Starting with the assumption that g is also jointly lower semicontinuous in y and z and positive and in addition satisfies a certain normalization condition, we find a sequence of supersolutions converging uniformly to the càdlàg supermartingale Eg,+(), the right limit of Eg(). We then use results on convergence of semimartingales given in Barlow and Protter [1] to identify a unique process Z^ such that (Eg,+(), Z^)  A(, g). By showing that Eg,+() always stays below Eg(), we deduce Eg,+() = Eg() and thus (Eg(), Z^) is the unique minimal supersolution. Later on, we relax the positivity assumption to that of boundedness below by an affine function of z. Also the normalization condition will be relaxed. Hence both, Drapeau et al. [6] and our work, show the existence of a unique minimal supersolution of BSDEs, but under mutually singular conditions on the generator.
Let us briefly discuss the existing literature on related problems, a broader discussion of which can be found in Drapeau et al. [6]. Nonlinear BSDEs were first introduced in Pardoux and Peng [11]. They gave existence and uniqueness results for the case of Lipschitz generators and square integrable terminal conditions. Kobylanski [10] studies BSDEs with quadratic generators, whereas Delbaen et al. [4] consider superquadratic BSDEs with positive generators that are convex in z and independent of y. Among the first introducing supersolutions of BSDEs were El Karoui et al. [7, Section 2.3]. Further references can also be found in Peng [13], who studies the existence and uniqueness of minimal supersolutions under the assumption of a Lipschitz generator and square integrable terminal conditions. Most recently, Cheridito and Stadje [2] have analyzed existence and stability of supersolutions of BSDEs. They consider terminal conditions which are functionals of the underlying Brownian motion and generators that are convex in z and Lipschitz in y and they work with discrete time approximations of BSDEs. Furthermore, the concept of supersolutions is closely related to Peng's g and G-expectations, see for instance [12, 14, 15], since the mapping   E0g() can be seen as a nonlinear expectation. Another related field are stochastic target problems as introduced in Soner and Touzi [20], the solutions of which are obtained by dynamic programming methods and can be characterized as viscosity solutions of second order PDEs.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Setting and notations are specified in Section 2. A precise definition of minimal supersolutions and important structural properties of Eg(), along with the main existence theorem, can then be found in Sections 3.1 and 3.2. Finally, possible relaxations on the assumptions imposed on the generator, as well as a generalization to the case of arbitrary continuous local martingales, are discussed in Section 3.3.
2 Setting and Notations
We consider a filtered probability space (, F , (Ft)t0, P ), where the filtration (Ft) is generated by a d-dimensional Brownian motion W and is assumed to satisfy the usual conditions. For some fixed time horizon T > 0 and for all t  [0, T ], the sets of Ft-measurable random variables are denoted by L0(Ft), where random variables are identified in the P -almost sure sense. Let furthermore denote Lp(Ft) the set of random variables in L0(Ft) with finite p-norm, for p  [1, +]. Inequalities and strict inequalities
2

between any two random variables or processes X1, X2 are understood in the P -almost sure or in the

P  dt-almost sure sense, respectively. In particular, two càdlàg processes X1, X2 satisfying X1 = X2

are indistinguishable, compare [8, Chapter III]. We denote by T the set of stopping times with values in

[0, T ] and hereby call an increasing sequence of stopping times ( n), such that P [ n { n = T }] = 1, a

localizing sequence of stopping times. By S := S(R) we denote the set of càdlàg progressively measur-

able processes Y with values in R. For p  [1, +[, we further denote by Hp the set of càdlàg local mar-

tingales M with finite Hp-norm on [0, T ], that is M Hp := E[ M, M Tp/2]1/p < . By Lp := Lp (W ) we denote the set of R1×d-valued, progressively measurable processes Z, such that ZdW  Hp, that is,

Z

Lp

:= E[(

T 0

Zs2ds)p/2]1/p

is

finite.

For Z

 Lp, the stochastic integral (

t 0

ZsdWs)t[0,T ]

is

well

defined, see [16], and is by means of the Burkholder-Davis-Gundy inequality [16, Theorem 48] a contin-

uous martingale. We further denote by L := L (W ) the set of R1×d-valued, progressively measurable
processes Z, such that there exists a localizing sequence of stopping times ( n) with Z1[0,n]  L1, for
all n  N. For Z  L, the stochastic integral ZdW is well defined and is a continuous local martingale. Furthermore, for a process X, let X denote the following expression X := supt[0,T ] |Xt|, by which we define the norm X R := X L .

We call a càdlàg semimartingale X a special semimartingale, if it can be decomposed into X = X0 + M + A, where M is a local martingale and A a predictable process of finite variation such that M0 = A0 = 0. Such a decomposition is then unique, compare for instance [16, Chapter III, Theorem 30], and is called the canonical decomposition of X.

We will use normal integrands, a concept introduced in [18], as generators of BSDEs. Throughout this paper, a normal integrand is a function g :  × [0, T ] × R × R1×d  ]-, +], such that
· (y, z)  g (, t, y, z) is jointly lower semicontinuous, for all (, t)   × [0, T ] ;
· (, t)  g (, t, y, z) is progressively measurable, for all (y, z)  R × R1×d .
For a normal integrand g and progressively measurable processes Y, Z, the process g(Y, Z) is itself progressively measurable and the integral g(Y, Z)ds is well defined, P -almost surely, under the assumption that + -  = +, see [19, Chapter 14.F]. Finally, as long as g  0, the lower semicontinuity yields an extended Fatou's lemma, that is,

3 Minimal Supersolutions of BSDEs
3.1 First Definitions and Structural Properties
A pair (Y, Z)  S × L is called a supersolution of a BSDE, if, for 0  s  t  T , it satisfies

Ys - gu(Yu, Zu)du + ZudWu  Yt and YT   ,

for a normal integrand g as generator and a terminal condition   L0(FT ). For a supersolution (Y, Z), we call Y the value process and Z its corresponding control process. A control process Z is said to be admissible, if the continuous local martingale ZdW is a supermartingale. Throughout this paper we say that a generator g is
(POS) positive, if g(y, z)  0, for all (y, z)  R × R1×d.

(NOR) normalized, if gt(y, 0) = 0, for all (t, y)  [0, T ] × R.

We are now interested in the set

A(, g) := {(Y, Z)  S × L : Z is admissible and (3.1) holds}

(3.2)

and the process

Etg() = ess inf Yt  L0(Ft) : (Y, Z)  A(, g) , t  [0, T ] .

(3.3)

For the proof of our main existence theorem we will need some auxiliary results concerning structural properties of Eg() and supersolutions (Y, Z) in A(, g).

Lemma 3.1. Let g be a generator satisfying (POS). Assume further that A(, g) =  and -  L1(FT ). Then   L1(FT ) and, for any (Y, Z)  A(, g), the control Z is unique and the value process Y is a
supermartingale such that Yt  E [ | Ft]. Moreover, the unique canonical decomposition of Y is given

by

Y = Y0 + M - A ,

(3.4)

where M = ZdW and A is an increasing, predictable, càdlàg process with A0 = 0.

The proof of Lemma 3.1 can be found in [6, Lemma 3.4].

Proposition 3.2. Suppose that A(, g) =  and let   L0(FT ) be a terminal condition such that -  L1(FT ). If g satisfies (POS), then the process Eg() is a supermartingale and

Etg ( )



Etg,+()

for all t  [0, T ) ,

(3.5)

and ETg,+() := . In particular, Eg,+() is a càdlàg supermartingale. Furthermore, the following two pasting properties hold true.

1. Let (Zn)  L be admissible,   T , and (Bn)  F a partition of . Then the pasted process Z¯ = Z11[0,] + n1 Zn1Bn 1],T ] is admissible.
2. Let ((Y n, Zn))  A(, g),   T and (Bn)  F as before. If Y1-1Bn  Yn1Bn holds true for all n  N, then (Y¯ , Z¯)  A(, g), where

Y¯ = Y 11[0,[ +

Y n1Bn 1[,T ] and Z¯ = Z11[0,] +

Zn1Bn 1],T ] .

Proof. The proof of the part concerning the process Eg,+() can be found in [6, Proposition 3.5]. As to the first pasting property, let M n and M¯ denote the stochastic integrals of the Zn and Z¯, respectively.

First, it follows from (Zn)  L and from (Bn) being a partition that Z¯  L and that

n1

for 0  s  t  T . Thus, Z¯ is admissible. Finally, we can approximate  from below by some foretelling sequence of stopping times (m)1, and then show, analogously to [6, Lemma 3.1], that the pair (Y¯ , Z¯)
satisfies inequality (3.1) and is thus an element of A(, g).

Proposition 3.3. Let 0 = 0  1  2  · · · be a sequence of stopping times converging to the finite

stopping time   = limn n. Further, let (Y n) be a sequence of càdlàg supermartingales such that

Ynn-

satisfies

martingale. Then, for any sequence of stopping times n  [n-1, n[ , the limit Y  := limn Ynn

exists and the process

Y¯ :=

[n-1 ,n [

is a càdlàg supermartingale. Moreover, the limit Y  is independent of the approximating sequence (Ynn ) and, if all Y n are continuous and Ynn = Ynn+1, for all n  N, then Y¯ is continuous.

Proof. Note that (Ynn ) is a (Fn )-supermartingale. Indeed, if (~m)  n is a foretelling sequence of stopping times, then, with m := ~m  n-1, the family ((Ynm )-)mN is uniformly integrable and we obtain

E[Ynn++11 | Fn ] = E[E[Ynn++11 | Fn ] | Fn ]  E[Ynn+1 | Fn ]  E[Ynn- | Fn ]

Moreover, ((Ynn )-) is uniformly integrable. Hence, the sequence (Ynn ) converges by the supermartingale convergence theorem, see [5, Theorems V.28,29], to some random variable Y , P -almost surely, and thus Y¯ is well-defined. Furthermore, the limit Y  is independent of the approximating sequence
(Ynn ). Indeed, for any other sequence (~n) with ~n  [n-1, n[, the limit limn Y~nn exists by the same argumentation. Now limn Ynn = limn Y~nn = Y  holds, since the sequence (^n) defined by

^n :=

 n  ~ n , for n even 22
 n+1  ~ n+1 , for n odd 22

satisfies ^n  [n-1, n[ and limn Y^nn exists. Thus, all limits must coincide. Next, we show that Y¯ n is a supermartingale, for all n  N. To this end first observe that, for all 0  s  t,

n-2

E Y¯tn - Y¯sn | Fs =

E E Y¯(kn+1s)t - Y¯(kns)t | F(ks)t | Fs

k=0

+ E E Y¯(nns)t - Y¯(nn-1s)t | F(n-1s)t | Fs

+ E E Y¯tn - Y¯(nns)t | F(ns)t | Fs .

1Such a sequence satisfying ~m < , for all m  N, always exists, since in a Brownian filtration every stopping time is predictable, compare [17, Corollary V.3.3].

5

Note further that, for each n  N, the process Y¯ n is càdlàg and can only jump downwards, that is, Y¯t-n  Y¯tn , for all t  R. Observe to this end that, on the one hand, Y¯kn- = Ykk-  Ykk+1 = Y¯kn , for all 0  k  n - 1, by assumption, where we assumed k-1 < k, without loss of generality. On the other hand, Y k can only jump downwards. Indeed, as càdlàg supermartingales, all Y k can be decomposed into
Y k = Y0k + M k - Ak, by the Doob-Meyer decomposition theorem [16, Chapter III, Theorem 13], where M k is a local martingale and Ak a predictable, increasing process with Ak0 = 0. Since in a Brownian
filtration every local martingale is continuous, the claim follows.
Thus, for all 0  k  n - 2, and (~m)  k+1 a foretelling sequence of stopping times, it holds with
m := ~m  k,

Combining this we obtain that E Y¯tn | Fs  Y¯sn . Furthermore, limn Y¯tn = Y¯t, for all t  R. Indeed, let us write limn Y¯tn = limn Y¯tn 1{t<} + limn Y¯tn 1{t}. Then, limn Y¯tn 1{t} = limn Ynn 1{t} = Y 1{t} = Y¯t1{t} and limn Y¯nt1{t<} = Y¯t1{t<}. Hence, the claim follows. As a consequence of Fatou's lemma it now holds that

since the family ((Y¯tn )-) is uniformly integrable. Hence, Y¯ is a supermartingale, which by construction has right-continuous paths and [9, Theorem 1.3.8] then yields that Y¯ is even càdlàg. Finally, whenever all Y n are continuous and Ynn = Ynn+1 holds, for all n  N, the process Y¯ is continuous per construction.

3.2 Existence and Uniqueness of Minimal Supersolutions
We are now ready to state our main existence result. Possible relaxations of the assumptions (POS) and (NOR) imposed on the generator are discussed in Section 3.3. Note that it is not our focus to investigate conditions assuring the crucial assumption that A(, g) = . See Drapeau et al. [6] and the references therein for further details.
Theorem 3.4. Let g be a generator satisfying (POS) and (NOR) and   L0(FT ) be a terminal condition such that -  L1(FT ). If A(, g) = , then there exists a unique Z^  L such that (Eg(), Z^)  A(, g).
Proof. Step 1: Uniform Limit and Verification. Since A(, g) = , there exist (Y b, Zb)  A(, g). From now on we restrict our focus to supersolutions (Y¯ , Z¯) in A(, g) satisfying Y¯0  Y0b. Indeed, since we are only interested in minimal supersolutions, we can paste any value process of (Y, Z)  A(, g) at  := inf{t > 0 : Ytb > Yt}  T , such that Y¯ := Y b1[0,[ + Y 1[,T ] satisfies Y¯0  Y0b, where the corresponding control Z¯ is obtained as in Proposition 3.2.

6

Assume for the beginning that we can find a sequence ((Y n, Zn)) within A(, g) such that

lim
n

Y n - E g,+()

R = 0 .

(3.6)

Since all Y n are càdlàg supermartingales, they are, by the Doob-Meyer decomposition theorem, see [16,

Chapter III, Theorem 13], special semimartingales with canonical decomposition Y n = Y0n+M n-An as

in (3.4). The supermartingale property of all ZndW and   L1(FT ), compare Lemma 3.1, imply that

E [AnT ]  Y0b - E []  L1(FT ).

Hence, since each An is increasing, supn E[

T 0

|dAns |] < .

As (3.6)

implies in particular that limn E [(Y n - Eg,+())] = 0, it follows from [1, Theorem 1 and Corollary

2] that Eg,+() is a special semimartingale with canonical decomposition Eg,+() = E0g,+() + M - A

and that

The local martingale M is continuous and allows for a representation of the form M = M0 + Z^dW , where Z^  L, compare [16, Chapter IV, Theorem 43]. Since

to

inequality.

In

particular,

limn Zn() = Z^(), dt-almost surely, for almost all   .

In order to verify that (Eg,+(), Z^)  A(, g), we will use the convergence obtained above. More pre-

cisely, for all 0  s  t  T , Fatou's lemma together with (3.6) and the lower semicontinuity of the

generator yields

Esg,+() - gu(Eug,+(), Z^u)du + Z^udWu

ss

t

 lim sup Ysn - gu(Yun, Zun)du + ZundWu  lim sup Ytn = Etg,+() .

The above, the positivity of g and Eg,+()  E [ | F·] imply that Z^dW  E [ | F·] - E0g,+(). Hence, being bounded from below by a martingale, the continuous local martingale Z^dW is a supermartingale. Thus, Z^ is admissible and (Eg,+(), Z^)  A(, g) and therefore, by Lemma 3.1, Z^ is unique. Since we
know by Proposition 3.2 that Eg()  Eg,+(), we deduce that Eg() = Eg,+() by the definition of Eg(), identifying (Eg(), Z^) as the unique minimal supersolution.

Step 2: A preorder on A(, g). As to the existence of ((Y n, Zn)) satisfying (3.6), it is sufficient to show that, for arbitrary  > 0, we can find a supersolution (Y , Z) satisfying

Y  - E g,+() R   . We define the following preorder2 on A(, g)

(3.7)

(Y 1, Z1) (Y 2, Z2)  1  2 and (Y 1, Z1)1[0,1[ = (Y 2, Z2)1[0,1[ ,

(3.8)

2Note that, in order to apply Zorn's lemma, we need a partial order instead of just a preorder. To this end we consider equivalence

7

where, for i = 1, 2,

i = inf t  0 : Yti > Etg,+() +   T .

(3.9)

For any totally ordered chain ((Y i, Zi))iI within A(, g) with corresponding stopping times i, we want to construct an upper bound. If we consider

  = ess sup i ,
iI
we know by the monotonicity of the stopping times that we can find a monotone subsequence (m) of (i)iI such that   = limm m. In particular,   is a stopping time. Furthermore, the structure of the preorder (3.8) yields that the value processes of the supersolutions ((Y m, Zm)) corresponding to the stopping times (m) satisfy

Ymm+1  Ymm+-1 = Ymm- , for all m  N ,

(3.10)

where the inequality follows from the fact that all Y m are càdlàg supermartingales, see the proof of Proposition 3.3.

Step 3: A candidate upper bound (Y¯ , Z¯) for the chain ((Y i, Zi))iI . We construct a candidate upper bound (Y¯ , Z¯) for ((Y i, Zi))iI satisfying P [ (Y¯ ) >   |   < T ] = 1, with  (Y¯ ) as in (3.9).
To this end, let (¯n) be a decreasing sequence of stopping times taking values in the rationals and converging towards   from the right3. Then the stopping times ^n := ¯n  T satisfy ^n >   and ^n  Q, on {  < T }, for all n big enough. Let us furthermore define the following stopping time

¯ := inf

t > 

: 1{ <T }

Eg,+() - Etg,+()

 >
2

T .

(3.11)

Due to the right-continuity of Eg,+() in  , it follows that ¯ >   on {  < T }. We now set

n := ^n  ¯ , for all n  N.

(3.12)

The above stopping times still satisfy limn n =   and n >   on {  < T }, for all n  N. We further define the following sets

An :=

Eg,+() - Egm ()



Eg,+() - Egm,+()

 <,
8

for all m  n .

(3.13)

They satisfy An  An+1 and n An =  by definition of the sequence (m)4. Note further that

An  Fn holds true by construction. By Proposition 3.2 we deduce5 that, for each n  N, there exist

(Y~ n, Z~n)  A(, g) such that

(3.14)

classes of processes. Two supersolutions (Y 1, Z1), (Y 2, Z2)  A(, g) are said to be equivalent, that is, (Y 1, Z1)  (Y 2, Z2), if (Y 1, Z1) (Y 2, Z2) and (Y 2, Z2) (Y 1, Z1). This means that they are equal up to their corresponding
stopping time 1 = 2 as in (3.9). This induces a partial order on the set of equivalence classes and hence the use of Zorn's
lemma is justified. 3 Compare [9, Problem 2.24]. 4Since on {  < T }, ¯ >   and limn ^n =   with ^n  Q, it is ensured that there exists some n0  N, depending on ,
such that n takes values in the rationals for all n  n0. By definition of Eg,+() as the right-hand side limit of Eg() on the rationals and due to the right-continuity of Eg,+() in  , both inequalities in the definition of An are satisfied for all n  n0. 5For a detailed proof, see [6, Proposition 3.2.].

Next we partition  into Bn := An\An-1, where we set A0 :=  and 0 := 0, and define the candidate upper bound as

Step 4a: The value process Y¯ is an element of S. By construction, the only thing to show is that Y¯-, the left limit at  , exists. This follows from Proposition 3.3, since, by means of ((Y m, Zm))  A(, g)
and   L1(FT ), all Y m are càdlàg supermartingales, see Lemma 3.1, which are bounded from below by a uniformly integrable martingale, more precisely Y m  E [ | F·], for all m  N, and satisfy (3.10).

N n1[n-1,n[  1[n-1,n[(-E - | F· - Y0b) .

the

is a well-defined continuous supermartingale due to Proposition 3.3. Hence we may define a localizing
sequence by setting n := inf{t  0 : |Nt| > n}  T and deduce that N is a continuous local martingale, because N n is a uniformly integrable martingale, for all n  N. Indeed, for each n  N and m  N, the process (N m)n , being a bounded stochastic integral, is a martingale. Moreover, the family (Nmnt)mN is uniformly integrable and Nnt = limm Nmnt, for all t  [0, T ]. Consequently, E[Ntn | Fs] = limm E[Nmnt | Fs] = limm Nmns = Nsn , for all 0  s  t  T , and the claim follows. Since the quadratic variation of a continuous local martingale is continuous and unique, see [9,

where the inequality follows from (3.1) and (POS). Being bounded from below by a martingale, we de-
duce by Fatou's lemma that Z¯1[0,] is admissible. Since Z¯1],] = 0 and all Z~n are admissible, it follows from Proposition 3.2 that Z¯ is indeed admissible.

Step 4c: The pair (Y¯ , Z¯) is a supersolution. Finally, showing that (Y¯ , Z¯) satisfy (3.1) identifies (Y¯ , Z¯)

as an element of A(, g). Observe first that, for all 0  s  t  T and all m  N, the expression

(3.22)

where the second inequality in (3.22) follows from ((Y~ n, Z~n))  A(, g) and Proposition 3.2.

Step 5: The maximal element (Y M , ZM ). By Zorn's lemma, there exists a maximal element (Y M , ZM ) in A(, g) with respect to the preorder (3.8), satisfying, without loss of generality, YTM = . By showing that the corresponding stopping time satisfies  M = T , we have obtained a supersolution (Y M , ZM ) satisfying Y M - Eg,+() R  , due to the definition of  M in analogy to (3.9). Thus, choosing Y M = Y  in (3.7) would finish our proof. But on { M < T } we could consider the chain consisting only of (Y M , ZM ) and, analogously to (3.15) and (3.16), construct an upper bound (Y¯ , Z¯), with corresponding stopping time  (Y¯ ) as in (3.9), satisfying P [ (Y¯ ) >  M |  M < T ] = 1. This yields P [ M < T ]  P [ (Y¯ ) >  M ] = 0, due to the maximality of  M . Hence we deduce that  M = T .
The techniques used in the proof of Theorem 3.4 show that A(, g) exhibits a certain closedness under
monotone limits of decreasing supersolutions.

11

Theorem 3.5. Let g be a generator satisfying (POS) and (NOR) and   L0(FT ) a terminal condition
such that -  L1(FT ). Let furthermore ((Y n, Zn)) be a decreasing sequence within A(, g) with pointwise limit Y¯t := limn Ytn, for t  [0, T ]. Then Y¯ is a supermartingale and it holds

Y¯t  Y^t := lim Y¯s for all t  [0, T ) .
st
sQ

(3.23)

Moreover, with Y^T := , there is a sequence ((Y~ n, Z~n))  A(, g) such that limn Y~ n - Y^ R = 0, and a unique control Z^  L such that (Y^ , Z^)  A(, g).

Proof. First, Y¯ is a supermartingale by monotone convergence. Inequality (3.23) is then proved analo-
gously to (3.5) as in [6, Proposition 3.5]. The rest follows by adapting all steps in the proof of Theorem 3.4 and replacing Eg,+() by Y^ .

In a next step, we turn our focus to the question whether it is possible to find a minimal supersolution within A(, g), the associated control process Z of which belongs to L1 and therefore ZdW constitutes

a true martingale instead of only a supermartingale. To this end we consider the following subset of

A(, g)

A1(, g) := (Y, Z)  A(, g) : Z  L1 .

(3.24)

By imposing stronger assumptions on the terminal condition , the next theorem yields the existence of a unique minimal supersolution in A1(, g).

Theorem 3.6. Assume that the generator g satisfies (POS) and (NOR) and let   L0(FT ) be a terminal condition such that (E[- | F·])  L1(FT ). If A1(, g) = , then there exists a unique Z^ such that (Eg(), Z^)  A1(, g).
Proof. A1(, g) =  yields that A(, g) = , because A1(, g)  A(, g). Also, from (E [- | F·])T  L1(FT ) we deduce that -  L1(FT ). Hence, Theorem 3.4 yields the existence of an unique control Z^, such that (Eg(), Z^)  A(, g). Verifying that Z^  L1 is done as in [6, Theorem 4.5].

3.3 Relaxations of the Conditions (NOR) and (POS)

In this section we discuss possible relaxations of the conditions (NOR) and (POS) imposed on the generator throughout Sections 3.1 and 3.2. First, we want to replace (NOR) by the weaker assumption (NOR'). We say that a generator g satisfies

(NOR') if, for all   T , there exists some stopping time  >  such that the stochastic differential

equation

dys = gs(ys, 0)ds ,

y

=

Eg,+()

+

 2

(3.25)

admits a solution on [, ].

By this we obtain the following corollary to Theorem 3.4.

Corollary 3.7. Let g be a generator satisfying (POS) and (NOR') and   L0(FT ) a terminal condition such that -  L1(FT ). If A(, g) = , then there exists a unique Z^  L such that (Eg(), Z^)  A(, g).

Proof. We will proceed along the lines of the proof of Theorem 3.4 with the focus on the required alterations.

12

The first difficulty lies in the pasting at the stopping time   within the definition of (Y¯ , Z¯) in (3.15)

and (3.16). Instead of extending by a constant function, we concatenate the value process at   with the

solution

of

the

SDE

(3.25),

started

at

y 

=

Eg,+()

+

 2

and

denoted

by

y.

We

emphasize

that

the

zero

control is maintained.

Furthermore, we have to introduce an additional stopping time and adjust ¯ defined in (3.11), in order to

ensure that our constructed value process does not leave the -neighborhood of Eg,+(). We define

t

 := inf{t >   : 1{<T }

gs(ys, 0)ds

>

} 6







and

¯ := inf{t >  

:

1{<T }|Eg,+() - Etg,+()| >

}  T 6

(3.26) (3.27)

and use ¯ :=   ¯ within the definition of the sequence (n) in analogy to (3.12), that is, n = ^n  ¯,

for all n  N. As before, we set  := n1 1Bn n.

The pasting in (3.15) and (3.16) is done analogously to the proof of Theorem 3.4, but now with the

distinction that Y¯ 1[,[ = y + 1[,[

· 

gs(ys,

0)ds.

by means of (3.26) and (3.27), together with the definition of n. Furthermore, on the set Bn,

(3.28)

The first inequality in (3.28) follows from (POS), whereas the second is proved analogously to the proof of

Theorem 3.4, using (3.27) and the definition of n. Hence, pasting at the stopping time  is in accordance
with Proposition 3.2. Finally, the downward jumps at   and at , together with the zero control in between, ensure that (Y¯ , Z¯)

satisfies (3.1), as was shown in Step 4c of the proof of Theorem 3.4. The rest of the proof does not need

any further alterations.

Also the positivity assumption (POS) on the generator can be relaxed to a linear bound below, which however has to be consistent with the assumption (NOR'). In the following we say that a generator g is

(LB-NOR') linearly bounded from below under (NOR'), if there exist adapted measurable processes

a and b with values in R1×d and R, respectively, such that g(y, z)  azT - b, for all

(y, z)  R × R1×d, and

dP a = E dP

adW
T

(3.29)

defines an equivalent probability measure P a. Furthermore,

t 0

bsds



L1(P a)

holds

for

all t  [0, T ], and a and b are such that the positive generator defined by

·



g¯(y, z) := g y + bsds, z - azT - b , for all (y, z)  R × R1×d ,

(3.30)

13

satisfies (NOR').
An (LB-NOR') setting can always be reduced to a setting with generator satisfying (POS) and (NOR'), by using the change of measure (3.29) and g¯ defined in (3.30). Hence, Lemma 3.1 and Proposition 3.2, which strongly rely on the property (POS), can be applied. Note that for the case b = 0, the generator g¯ even satisfies (POS) and (NOR). However, we need a slightly different definition of admissibility than before. A control process Z is said to be a-admissible, if ZdW a is a P a-supermartingale, where W a = W 1 - a1ds, · · · , W d - adds T is a P a-Brownian motion by Girsanov's theorem.

The set Aa(, g) := {(Y, Z)  S × L : Z is a-admissible and (3.1) holds}, as well as the process
Etg,a() = ess inf{Yt  L0(Ft) : (Y, Z)  Aa(, g)} , for t  [0, T ] ,
are defined analogously to (3.2) and (3.3), respectively. We are now ready to state our most general result, which follows from Corollary 3.7 and [6, Theorem 4.16].
Theorem 3.8. Let g be a generator satisfying (LB-NOR') and   L0(FT ) a terminal condition such that -  L1(P a). If in addition Aa(, g) = , then there exists a unique a-admissible control Z^ such that (Eg,a(), Z^)  Aa(, g).

3.4 Continuous Local Martingales and Controls in L1

Under stronger integrability conditions, the techniques used in the proof of Theorem 3.4 can be general-

ized to the case where the Brownian motion W appearing in the stochastic integral in (3.1) is replaced by

a d-dimensional continuous local martingale M . Let us assume that M is adapted to a filtration (Ft)t0,

which satisfies the usual conditions and in which all martingales are continuous and all stopping times are

predictable. We consider controls within the set L1 := L1(M ), consisting of all R1×d-valued, progres-

sively measurable processes Z, such that ZdM  H1. As before, for Z  L1 the stochastic integral

(

is

well

defined

and

is

uous martingale. A pair (Y, Z)  S × L1 is now called a supersolution of a BSDE, if it satisfies, for

0  s  t  T,

tt
Ys - gu(Yu, Zu)d M u + ZudMu  Yt and YT   ,
ss

(3.31)

for a normal integrand g as generator and a terminal condition   L0(FT ). We will focus on the set

AM,1(, g) := (Y, Z)  S × L1 : (Y, Z) satisfy (3.31) .

If we assume AM,1(, g) to be non-empty, Theorem 3.4 combined with compactness results for sequences of H1-bounded martingales given in Delbaen and Schachermayer [3] yields that

Etg() := ess inf Yt  L0(Ft) : (Y, Z)  AM,1(, g) , t  [0, T ] ,

(3.32)

is the value process of the unique minimal supersolution within AM,1(, g). Note that Lemma 3.1 and Proposition 3.2 extend to the case where W is substituted by M .

Theorem 3.9. Assume that the generator g satisfies (POS) and (NOR) and let   L0(FT ) be a terminal condition such that (E[- | F·])  L1(FT ). If AM,1(, g) = , then there exists a unique Z^ such that (Eg(), Z^)  AM,1(, g).

14

Proof. By assumption, there is some (Y b, Zb)  AM,1(, g) and we consider, without loss of generality, only those pairs (Y, Z)  AM,1(, g) satisfying Y  Y b, obtained by suitable pasting as in Proposition 3.2. Using the techniques of the proof of Theorem 3.4, we can find a sequence ((Y n, Zn))  AM,1(, g) satisfying limn Y n - Eg,+() R = 0, in analogy to (3.6). Since ( ZndM ) is uniformly bounded in H1, compare [6, Theorem 4.5], it follows from [1, Theorem 1] that Eg,+() is a special semimartingale with canonical decomposition Eg,+() = E0g,+() + N - A and that

lim
n

ZndM - N = 0 .
H1

(3.33)

Moreover, N  H1. Now [3, Theorem 1.6] yields the existence of some Z^  L1 such that N =

that (Eg,+(), Z^) satisfy (3.31) is now done analogously to Step 1 in the proof of Theorem 3.4, and hence

we are done.
