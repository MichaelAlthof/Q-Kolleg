1 Introduction
The size of the multiplier has received a renewed interest since the American Investment and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) stimulus has been enacted in 2009. Influential papers in the recent New Keynesian literature have shown that the government spending multiplier is larger at the zero lower bound (ZLB for short) on the nominal interest rate than in normal times (Eggertsson (2011), Christiano et al. (2011) and Fernández-Villaverde et al. (2012)). The reason is that when the nominal interest rate is pinned at zero, the monetary policy does not absorb the propagation of the government spending shock which better translates into output. However, these studies have paid little attention to the way government spending is modeled while the composition of the fiscal package may crucially impact the size of the multiplier. The ability of government spending to serve as input to private production or to be substitutable for private consumption (Barro (1990)) may have important consequences. In a simple New Keynesian model, we investigate alternative specifications for the composition of government spending. We show that the multiplier at the ZLB is 1) lower when the government spending is productive; 2) lower when consumption and government purchases are substitutable and 3) negative if the composition of the fiscal package rules out the non substitutability of government spending for private consumption. With our preferred ARRA specification the multiplier is barely higher than outside the ZLB and lower than 1.

2 The model
We build a standard New Keynesian DSGE model with Rotemberg sticky prices, monopolistic competition and a Taylor rule on the nominal interest rate. Government spending can be either productive (Gtp) or utility-enhancing. The second case can be divided into perfectly substitutable (Gts) and non-substitutable (Gtn) for private consumption.

where ct is aggregate consumption and nt is the level of employment supplied by households.  and  denote the risk aversion coefficient and the inverse of

the Frisch elasticity respectively. t represents a discount factor shock that we
interpret as a preference shock. The representative household takes as given {pt, wt, it}t=0 and the initial wealth (d0) in order to maximize equation (1) subject to the budget constraint:

ptct + dt = dt-1(1 + it-1) + wtnt + t - Tt

(2)

where t is firms' profits, dt bonds, pt the aggregate price and Tt is a lump-
sum tax. Optimality conditions are given by the following equations (with t = pt/pt-1 and wtR = wt/pt):

t = (ct + Gts)- t = (1 + it)Ett+1 t+1
t+1 wtR = nt(ct + Gts)

2.2 Firms

The final good producer operates in a perfectly competitive market. He pro-
duces a good yt using intermediate goods yjt. The demand for the intermediate good j writes:

yjt =

pjt pt

yt

where is the elasticity of substitution between goods. The nominal price

index is defined by pt =

1 0

p1jt-

dj

1- .

There is a continuum of monopolistically competitive producers indexed

by j using two inputs to produce and sell output yjt to final good producers.

The first one is labor njt (such that nt =

1 0

njtdj).

As

in

Linnemann

&

Schabert

(2006), Bouakez & Guillard (2013) and Roulleau-Pasdeloup (2013), the second

one is productive government spending Gtp:

yjt = (Gtp)1-njt

(7)

with 1 -  being the elasticity of output to productive government spending.
We thus make the standard assumption of constant returns to scale. Firm j maximizes its intertemporal profit (8) taking {pt, wt}t=0 as given, subject to (6) and (7):

(9) (10)

where mct is the Lagrange multiplier associated with (7). Equation (10) is the forward-looking New Keynesian Phillips Curve.

2.3 Monetary and fiscal authorities
We assume that the central bank adjusts the nominal interest rate following a Taylor rule1 (bounded by the ZLB) in response to deviations of inflation and output from their steady-state values:

1 + it =

 t  
1

yt y y

if it > 0 otherwise

(11)

Total government expenditures Gt are shared as follows: Gts = Gt, Gtp = Gt and Gtn = (1 -  - )Gt, with 0   +   1. Finally, Gt = g¯ exp(gt) where gt follows an AR(1) process and g¯ is the amount of government spending at the steady state.

2.4 Market clearing
The aggregation of individual profits t is given by: t = ptyt - ntwt - ptytt . Together with the budget constraint (2) and the government budget constraint, this gives the aggregate resource constraint :

Structural estimates of New

Keynesian models find values around 0.5 for this coefficient (see Krause & Lubik (2007)

(and thus the one of private consumption) usually obtained in the literature.

4 Results
We study five specifications: (i) Gt = Gtn; (ii) Gt = Gtp; (iii) Gt = Gts and (iv) two specifications that attempt to represent the legislated part of the ARRA fiscal package. Cogan et al. (2010) have studied the impact of the ARRA but they do not provide a detailed decomposition of different types of government

This latter solves non-linear stochastic dynamic problems using polynomials (we rely on Chebyshev ones here) to approximate conditional expectations. The probability of entering and leaving the ZLB are endogenously determined and are considered in agents' expectations. Contrary to backward-induction methods (perfect foresight and the extended path method), agents internalize future shock uncertainty since they are evaluated in the expectations.

When computing total government spending over 2009-2010 we do not consider income support and tax cuts since those two components are neutral in a representative agent framework with lump-sum taxes. Identifying productive government spending with infrastructure spending, we get  = 0.35. The categorization of the remaining expenses is more debatable. In our preferred ARRA specification, we take the Health/Education component as perfectly substitutable government spending. This is only an approximation since, for example, public and private education differ in terms of quality. With this in mind, we find  = 0.18 for the share of substitutable government spending in the stimulus plan. The remaining share is non-substitutable government spending, 1 -  -  = 0.47. However, to get a range for the multiplier under the ARRA specification, it is useful to consider two polar cases in which non-productive government spending is either non-substitutable (ARRA1) or substitutable with private consumption (ARRA2).
Finally, we choose the standard deviation and autoregressive parameters to match the size of the fiscal package as a share of GDP for 2009-2010, which is equal to 1.58%. This gives b = 0.1825. We choose g = 0.7 so that stimulus spending essentially vanishes after 8 quarters3. To investigate the ZLB we use a discount factor shock t that sends the economy in a liquidity trap 8 quarters. The multiplier at the ZLB is calculated as the response of output following a shock on t and gt in deviation from the response of output to a shock on t

Figure 1: Government spending multiplier.

In the benchmark model, the multiplier reaches 0.56 outside the ZLB and 1.5 at the ZLB. These values are broadly consistent with the related literature in which the multiplier at the ZLB is higher than one and about three times higher than in normal times. In normal times, the nominal interest rate adjusts upward against the output and inflationary pressures caused by the increase in government purchases. Consequently, the increase in the real interest rate dampens the output effects of government expenses. When the nominal interest rate is pinned at zero, higher government spending results in a lower real rate and thus a multiplier that exceeds unity.
One can see that the composition of the fiscal package greatly influences its efficacy. One earlier reference to the composition of the fiscal package is Eggertsson (2011). He notes that for government spending to be effective at increasing demand at the ZLB, it has to be directed at goods that are imperfect substitutes with private consumption (such as infrastructure or military spending). In fact, as the dotted line shows, the impact of perfectly substitutable government spending is nil. The reason is that private consumption exactly offsets any effect stemming from this kind of government spending. However, Eggertsson (2011) treats infrastructure spending as imperfectly substitutable. Being productive, infrastructure spending should appear in the aggregate production function, implying a negative effect on the real marginal cost and thus on prices. This deflation generates higher real interest rates which reduce private consumption now. Indeed, Figure 1 shows that intro-

ducing productive government spending in the fiscal package can reduce the

size of the output multiplier in a liquidity trap (see Bouakez & Guillard (2013),

Roulleau-Pasdeloup (2013)). Let us begin with the second polar case, ARRA2.

In this case, productive government spending generates a deflation that trig-

gers a negative multiplier at the ZLB. To paraphrase Eggertsson (2011), a pol-

icy that increases the natural rate of output can decrease actual output in the

short-run. But those effects on natural output grow as  increases. To see this,

consider the case of only productive government spending (circled line). In

the short run, government spending has aggregate demand (through the prod-

uct market equilibrium) as well as aggregate supply (through the production

function) effects. But increasing productive government spending raises the

natural level of private consumption tomorrow, which prompts households

to consume more today, generating inflation today. As  grows larger then,

increasing productive government spending is effectively an aggregate de-

mand policy. This is why the all-productive and first polar/ARRA1 cases yield

very similar results (which we do not report for the ARRA1 to save space on

the graph): beyond  = 0.35, productive and non-substitutable government

spending have similar effects. For our preferred ARRA specification (squared

line), the aggregate demand effects of non-substitutable government spend-

ing are dampened by the aggregate supply effects of productive government

spending and the nil effect coming from substitutable government spending.

This results in a multiplier that hovers around 0.7, only slightly higher from its

value in normal times.

Since the Taylor rule is active outside the ZLB, aggregate supply effects

tend to dampen the increase in real rates and thus limit the crowding out of

private consumption. Coupled with a higher level of natural consumption

tomorrow, productive government spending induces higher multipliers than

in the standard case.

As this discussion has made clear, results depend crucially on how (dis)-

inflationary the fiscal stimulus is. In fact, most of the literature on the ZLB has

emphasized the role of real interest rates. While our benchmark calibration is

in line with some of the empirical evidence, higher values for  = 40 cannot

be ruled out (see e.g. the discussion in Erceg & Lindé (2010) and the references

therein). Since  indexes price rigidity, a higher value for this parameter will

and the standard multiplier for both  = 40 and  = 90. The case  = 90 corresponds to an average duration of prices of 4 quarters 5or a Calvo probability

of 0.75, as in Taylor (1999).

5The result are similar when considering a Calvo parameter of 0.9, which implies an average duration of prices of 10 quarters and a price rigidity parameter  = 650.

Figure 2: Government spending multiplier.

In line with the intuition, the composition of government spending induces a lower gap between the multipliers. This shows in the case where the economy is outside the ZLB. At the ZLB however, some differences remain. In the standard case, higher price rigidity induces lower inflation on impact and thus a lower multiplier. In the ARRA specification, higher price rigidity induces less deflation so that the multiplier actually increases.
In summary, for the stimulative effects of government spending to be maximal at the ZLB, government spending should be both non-substitutable with private consumption and wasteful. This was surely not the case with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which included productive and substitutable government spending as well. Our simulations indicate that its effects were not likely to be much larger than in normal times, with output increasing less than government spending.

5 Conclusion
We show that the multiplier at the ZLB may substantially vary, depending on whether the government spending is productive, substitutable or not with consumption. It lies between -0.25 and +1.5 according to the different specifications. It highlights that the modeling of government spending has important implications for the policy analysis. The assumptions made about the structure of government spending should be carefully considered. The estimation of a more micro-founded DSGE model should be conducted for future research to determine the right structure of government spending.
