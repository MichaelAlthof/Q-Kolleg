Abstract The distribution of treatment effects extends the prevailing focus on average treatment effects to the tails of the outcome variable and quantile treatment effects denote the predominant technique to compute those effects in the presence of a confounding mechanism. The underlying quantile regression is based on a L1≠loss function and we propose the technique of expectile treatment effects, which relies on expectile regression with its L2≠loss function. It is shown, that apart from the extreme tail ends expectile treatment effects provide more efficient estimates and these theoretical results are broadened by a simulation and subsequent analysis of the classic LaLonde data. Whereas quantile and expectile treatment effects perform comparably on extreme tail locations, the variance of the expectile variant amounts in our simulation on all other locations to less than 80% of its quantile equivalent and under favourable conditions to less than 2/3. In the LaLonde data expectile treatment effects reduce the variance by more than a quarter, while at the same time smoothing the treatment effects considerably.

1 Introduction

The analysis of a particular intervention and especially the effect it exhibits on a specific outcome variable has been a central issue in statistical data analysis and several classic techniques were invented to answer this question (Fisher, 1935). Whereas at first the design and analysis of experiments were of much interest, more recently the focus in social sciences has shifted to the evaluation of treatment effects from observational data, as in many circumstances the execution of experiments is infeasible or too costly. In this context treatment effects quantify causal outcomes arising from a clearly identifiable intervention and are for example applied to assess new policies or programmes (e.g. LaLonde, 1986; Dehejia and Wahba, 1999).

These applications most often concentrate on an average effect on the population or some subgroup thereof. However, the predominant Rubin Causal Model (Rubin, 1974) allows for heterogeneity in response to a treatment and the focus on average affects inhibits the disclosure of possibly deviant effects in the tails of the outcome distribution. Contrary quantile treatment effects (Doksum, 1974; Lehmann, 1974) allow to analyse the effect distribution and, given covariates, apply quantile regression techniques (Koenker and Bassett, 1978) to infer the causal effect. Quantile treatment effect have been applied to such diverse topics as teacher shortage in African countries (Bourdon et al., 2010), returns to education in China (Messinis, 2013) or export promotion programmes in developing countries (Volpe Martincus and Carballo, 2010). Recent methodology advances have addressed the usage of instrument variables (Abadie et al., 2002; Chernozhukov and Hansen, 2005) or regression discontinuity designs (Frandsen et al., 2012). Furthermore Machado and Mata (2005) and Firpo et al. (2009) extend quantile treatment effects to the unconditional distribution of the outcome variable.

The application of quantile regression to compute the distribution of treatment
effects seems to denote an obvious choice, as its usage of the inverse c.d.f. allows for an intuitive understanding of the location parameter   (0, 1) on the distri-
bution of the outcome variable. Accordingly any quantile q may be denoted as q = F-1( ). Furthermore quantiles may also be defined as a minimum contrast parameter estimator, as

q 

q = arg min (1 -  ) |v - q | f(v)dv +  |v - q | f(v)dv .

q -

q

Quantile regression subtitutes the quantile q for a regression model based on covariates.

However, given the somewhat arbitrary loss (contrast) function above it may be noted that quantile regression describes only one particular candidate to infer the (conditional) distribution of an outcome variable and expectiles, respectively expectile regression (Newey and Powell, 1987), denote a suitable alternative. Given some location parameter   (0, 1), expectiles e are based on a slight variation of the minimization problem detailed above, as they solve the optimization

e 

e = arg min (1 - ) (v - e)2 f(v)dv +  (v - e)2 f(v)dv

e -

e

and consequently exchange the L1≠loss function of quantiles for a L2 variant. As before expectile regression generates a regression model for e given a set of covariates.

3

Although some authors have assigned expectiles to the "spittoon" (Koenker, 2013), they have recently gained considerably attention and a lively debate can be found in Kneib (2013a) and the accompanying discussion. Recent applications of expectiles were presented in financial statistics (Taylor, 2008), business statistics (Kokic et al., 2000) and demographics (Schnabel and Eilers, 2009b) and much methodology research on expectiles has concentrated on confidence measures (Duran et al., 2011; Guo and H®ardle, 2012; Sobotka et al., 2013).
Whereas expectiles miss the intuitive indication of the location the parameter  defines, Newey and Powell (1987) note that expectiles are more efficient than quantiles. Hence, as both techniques present unbiased estimates, any comparison in terms of mean squared error is restricted to analysing the estimators' variances and in this respect expectiles predominately outperform quantiles. Furthermore the smaller variance in expectile regression affects the computation of treatment effects twice, as the potential outcome framework (Neyman, 1923; Rubin, 1974) demands a regression for the programme group separately from the regression in the control group.
Given this efficiency gain of expectiles, we adopt them to compute the distribution of treatment effects along an outcome variable and consequently introduce the technique of expectile treatment effects. In order to demonstrate the advantages of this novel approach we present a proof that apart from extreme tail ends expectile regression is more efficient than quantile regression, and this advantage of expectiles causes expectile treatment effects to be more efficient than quantile treatment effects.
In a subsequent simulation we drop some of the assumptions, which are necessary for the theoretical proof, and quantify the efficiency gain on broader terms. We find, that apart from extreme tail locations expectile treatment effects possess an at least 20% smaller variance and under favourable conditions the variance of the expectile procedure amounts to only 2/3 of the quantile variant. However, this advantage of expectile treatment effect is not observed at the more difficult tail ends, where both approaches perform comparably.
In an application of the novel expectile treatment effects procedure we analyse the classic LaLonde data (LaLonde, 1986) and contrast the new approach with the standard quantile treatment effect. In our implementation of a counterfactual decomposition approach (Machado and Mata, 2005) we observe that expectile treatment effects and quantile treatent effects present comparable medial results, but the variance of expectile variant amounts to less than 3/4 of the quantile equivalent.
In the next section we will detail the expectile treatment effects technique and present a theoretical comparison with quantile treatment effects in the end. Afterwards in section 3 the efficiency gain of expectile treatment effects is quantified in a simulation and section 4 describes the aforementioned application of both techniques to analyse the LaLonde data. Finally section 4 concludes.
2 Expectile Treatment Effects
The analysis of treatment effects strives to quantify causal consequences generated by a specific intervention, e.g. the implementation of a new programme, a change of policy or the execution of an experiment, and denote a popular tool in the evalua-
4

tion of medicine, public policies and other interventions. In these settings a portion of the statistical units i  {1, . . . , N } is treated by a particular measure and the resulting effects, if any, are evaluated by some outcome variable Yi. An overview on the applied econometric techniques and the accompanying literature is given by, among others, Imbens and Wooldridge (2009), while Pearl (2000) presents a statistical approach to intervention effects based on graphical models and structural equation models, which is, however, not of direct interest to our work.

The evaluation is typically performed by comparing statistical units affected by the measure, denoted by Wi = 1, with other units which are not exposed to the measure, that is Wi = 0. Obviously at any point in time the same unit can only be analysed in one of the two settings and a direct comparison at the individual level is therefore infeasible (Holland, 1986). The potential outcome framework (Neyman, 1923; Rubin, 1974) overcomes this issue by defining the realized outcome Yi as a function of the two potential outcomes Yi(Wi) which arise if the observation is, respectively is not, treated:

Yi = Yi(Wi) = Yi(0)(1 - Wi) + Yi(1)Wi.

(1)

Apart from the effect of Wi the realized outcome Yi is often also influenced by other factors. Experiments guarantee by their random assignment into treatment or control group, that any side effects are balanced between the two groups and consequently any observable difference might solely be caused by W . An application of this approach can for example be found in Heinrich et al. (2001) for behavioural economics and several other examples in development economics are cited in the review of Duflo et al. (2008). However, the use of experiments is often limited by moral constrains, e.g. the participation by a free agent can obviously not be forced, but is of voluntary character, or practical issues, e.g. additional costs for setting up an experiment.

On the other hand the quantification of treatment effects from observational data is often obscured by a selection mechanism, if either the statistical units or the corresponding administrator relates the potential participation in the intervention with the expected individual outcome. Such confounding mechanisms render a direct comparison between the treated and untreated statistical units unsuitable and Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) propose to utilize the conditional independence between intervention participation and outcome given a vector of covariates Xi
Wi  Yi(Wi)|Xi
to account for the confounding effect of Xi and consequently control its influence on the treatment effect. Ideally this approach ensures a so≠called unconfounded assignment, also known as selection on observables or exogeneity and depicts the workhorse of non-experimental treatment analysis. However, its properness in a certain research context can not be verified by a statistical test (Pearl, 2000).

Whereas the potential outcome framework allows for heterogeneity in response to the treatment due to its broad modelling approach, most studies are primarily concerned with medial treatment effects on the population, e.g. the so≠called average treatment effect (ATE), or some specific subgroups thereof, e.g. the average treatment effect on the treated (ATOT). This limited analysis neglects any deviant treatment effects in the tails of the outcome's distribution and consequently might miss important characteristics of the intervention of interest.

5

Quantile treatment effects (QTE) describe not only an average effect in terms of the effect on the median, but offer also effects at any quantile of interest and therefore describe the treatment effect's distribution. Doksum (1974) and Lehmann (1974) define QTE as the horizontal difference between the quantiles of two potential outcome functions:

QT E = F-Y 1(1)( ) - F-Y 1(0)( ),

(2)

where   (0, 1) defines the quantile and F-Y 1 denotes the inverse c.d.f., also known as quantile function. In case of additional covariates, either included for precision or
their confouding nature, the conditional quantile treatment effects can be denoted
by

cQT E = FY-1(1)|X( ) - FY-1(0)|X( ).

(3)

Linear quantile regression (Koenker and Bassett, 1978) denotes one parametric approach to infer the conditional quantiles and facilitates the computation (3). In an i.i.d. setting the linear model

Yi = Xi  + i, with Fi, (0) = 

is solved for the estimate  via the optimization constraint

n

 = arg min n-1

 Yi - Xi  ,

 i=1

(4)

where (u) = u ( - I (u < 0)) denotes the check function and I(∑) the indicator function. Consequently quantile regression is based on an asymmetrically weighted L1≠loss function.

Expectile regression (Newey and Powell, 1987) denotes an alternative approach to infer the conditional distribution Yi|Xi at some location   (0, 1), which also weights the error terms asymmetrically, but optimizes the L2≠loss function

n
 = arg min n-1  Yi - Xi 
 i=1

(5)

with the asymmetric least squares check function (u) = u2 | - I (u < 0)|. Expectile regression can be understood as a particular form of M≠quantile estimation (Breckling and Chamber, 1988), but usually  differs from  to describe the same location on the conditional distribution Yi|Xi. Indeed there exists a one≠to≠one relation between expectiles and quantiles (Jones, 1994; Yao and Tong, 1996) and Schulze Waltrup et al. (2013) exploit this relation to deduce quantiles from expectiles. This inference, although with less efficiency, has also been accomplished by Efron (1991), who obtains so≠called percentiles from expectiles by counting the number of observations below the expectile of interest.

Any well defined relation between quantiles and expectiles increases the practicability of expectiles, as contrary to quantiles and due to the expectiles' dependence on the global properties of the respective distribution, expectiles miss an intuitive indication of the exact location any chosen  defines. A further adverse consequence of this dependence is found in the sensitivity of expectile regression to outliers, whereas quantile regression is well≠known for its robustness (Koenker, 2013). On the other hand the estimation of expectiles relies on a least asymmetric weighted squares

6

algorithm (LAWS) and possess therefore a computational advantage if compared to the estimation of quantile regression (Kneib, 2013a). The quantile optimization constraint (4) is not continuously differentiable and instead linear programming techniques are applied. However, this difference affects the actual computation time less than the ease of implementing both approaches (Pertnoy and Koenker, 1997).

Concerning the application of both regression techniques to the analysis of treatment effects a crucial difference between quantile and expectile regression arises from the unequal variances of the respective estimators. Whereas both estimators are unbiased and asymptotically return the true coefficients , the expectile regression estimator is predominately more efficient than the quantile regression one. This property was at first observed by Newey and Powell (1987) and can be explained by the implied smoothing of expectile regression (Kneib, 2013b) and the information available to each estimator. Whereas expectiles utilise the actual distance between data points and fitted values, quantiles rely solely on the binary information of the data points lying below or above the fitted values (Schnabel and Eilers, 2009a).

In detail, He and Shao (1996) present the asymptotic variance≠covariance matrix for the estimate  of quantile regression in the case of independently and possibly identically distributed observations by

ACov( ) =  (1 -  )

n
f ,i (0)Xi Xi
i=1

-1 n
XiXi

n
f ,i (0)Xi Xi

, (6)

where f,i describes the density of the error. The presence of this term complicates the actual computation of (6), as its estimation, and consequently the estimation of
ACov( ), depends on the applied smoothing.

This issue does not translate to expectile regression, as Sobotka et al. (2013) report the equivalent for  as

ACov() =

where ,i = E ,i defines the expectation of the true individual weights of the asymmetric weighting schema (5).

An indication for the greater efficiency of expectile regression can be derived from the following lemma and its proof in the appendix.
Lemma 1. For Zi = {Yi, Xi}  identically and independently  i with a distribution according to the c.d.f. F(Yi|Xi) and an error term following a normal distribution i  N(µ, 2), which is independent of the explanatory variables Xi, it can be shown that
1. ACov( ) > ACov(), if the location   [l, u].
2. The corresponding endpoints l,u are defined by

l,u = 0.5 ±

Following the standard assumption of µ = 0 allows to infer the interval as   [0.199, 0.801]. Obviously |µ| > 0 increases the interval, whereas a large variance 2 decreases it. Nevertheless, under the given assumptions expectile regression is more efficient on most parts of the distribution Yi|Xi and is outperformed by quantile regression only on the extreme tail ends. In the sub-
sequent simulation we will consider a reduced set of assumptions to broaden
this theoretical result and quantify the actual efficiency gain.

Having noted the superior performance of expectile regression and mirroring QTE defined by (2) expectile treatment effects (ETE) may be introduced as
ET E = GY (1)() - GY (0)(),
where GY denotes the expectile function of Yi corresponding to a particular location . Conditional expectile treatment effects also make use of covariates to reduce variance or, in case of confouding variable, to identify the actual treatment effect:

cET E = GY (1)|X() - GY (0)|X(),

(7)

where GY (W )|X can be obtained via expectile regression for any given vector Xi.

The difference in variance between the expectile and quantile regression estimator detailed above affects naturally the efficiency of cETE and cQTE and the resulting corollary is stated in the following lemma.
Lemma 2. Given the conditional distribution of Yi|Xi denoted jointly by  and , a treatment effect in the form of a global location change and the efficiency gain of expectile regression observed before as ACov( ) > ACov(), it can be shown that
AVar(cET E) < AVar(cQT E).
The corresponding proof is stated in the appendix.

3 Simulation

Our simulation is split in two parts. At the start of each bootstrap run an artificial population of size N = 200, 000 is generated to infer the quantile location parameter  describing the same locations as its expectiles equivalent  on the distribution Yi|Xi. Afterwards a sample is drawn from this population and the cETE, respectively cQTE, are computed on this sample. Within a stochastic parametrization framework this two≠step procedure is repeated 100, 000 times to observe the variance of both estimators.

The outcome Yi of the i  {1, . . . , N } observations is defined as the sum
of the gaussian treatment variable Zi  N(µZ,W , 1), three standard normal confouding variables Xi(1,2,3)  N(0, 1) and a heteroscedastic error term i to allow for varying treatment effects:

Yi = Zi + Xi(1) + Xi(2) + Xi(3) + i.

(8)

8

In order to provide robust simulation results independent of a specific parame-

trization, we vary certain parameters randomly along our simulation. Hence

in the equation (8) above we allow the standard deviation SD(i) of the het-

eroscedastic error term i =

(Zi+5) i

to

amount

to

a

half

or

a

quarter

of

the

standard deviation of all explanatory variables SD Zi + Xi(1) + Xi(2) + Xi(3) .

In detail, i  N(0, 1) describes a standard normal random variable and   U(0.5, {5, 10}) denotes a scaling parameter, which is uniformly distributed

on the set {5, 10} with probability 0.5 for each element. Furthermore in ap-

proximately half of the repetitions we randomly allow for a covariance of size

Cov Xi(∑), Xi(∑) = 0.25 among the three confounding variables and no covari-

ance in the other half.

The treatment effect is modeled as a global location shift on the expectation µZ,W of the treatment variable Zi. Whereas observations with a treatment status Wi = 0 are not affected by any treatment and consequently µZ,0 = 0, the expectation in the treatment group differs from zero and we randomly apply three different values by setting

µZ,1  U

1 , {0.7, 1.4, 2.1} 3

to mirror the average effect each confounding variable Xi(∑) possess on the treatment effect in the outcome Yi.

The assignment method to separate the treatment group from the control group is of stochastic nature to allow for an overlap between both groups and is based on the confounding variables. In detail, the individual participation Wi is determined by an application of the Bernoulli distribution

Wi  B(i),

where i denotes the individual propensity score which is computed as the

logistic function

i

=

1

exp(i) . + exp(i)

of the sum of the confounding variables i =

3 p=1

Xi(p).

Consequently due to their relatively high value in the confounding variables Xi(∑) approximately half of the population is assigned to the treatment group and consequently affected by the treatment. Their above average realization of Xi(∑) also affects the output variable Yi via (8) and completes therefore the confounding mechanism which has to be controlled for to identify the treat-
ment effect of Zi. The other half of the population is not affected by the
treatment and might serve in the control group.

Before we draw one sample from the artificial treatment population and another one from the artificial control population to compute the cETE and cQTE, we approximately determine  corresponding to
 = {0.01, 0.1, 0.25, 0.75, 0.9, 0.99}.

9

Hence we regress in an expectile regression framework the confouding variables Xi(1,2,3) on the outcome Yi and observe how many observations possess smaller conditional outcome values Yi|X(1,2,3) than the computed conditional
expectiles Y|X(1,2,3) (Efron, 1991):

N
 = N -1 I (Yi < Y| X(1,2,3)).
i=1

(9)

To facilitate the computation (9) we condition on the small interval [x - 0.25x, x + 0.25x], where x denotes the population wide multivariate mean of the confouding variables and x describes the variable specific standard deviation. This definition and the size of the artificial population N = 200, 000 ensure that in every repetition the observed empirical relation between  and  is based on more than 1000 observations.

Having established the relation between quantiles and expectiles in our simulation, we continue with the second step of actually comparing cQTE and cETE. Therefore we draw a random sample of the treated population and the untreated population. This size of the treatment sample nt, respectively control sample nc, are determined stochastically according to

nt  U nc  U

1, {100, 500, 1000} 3 1 3 , {2nt, 5nt, 10nt} .

Hence the combined samples include between 300 and 11, 000 observations and the control sample outnumbers the treatment sample to allow for the necessary overlap in the confouding variables between both samples.

Afterwards quantile regression, respectively expectile regression, are applied separately to both samples and the cQTE, respectively the cETE conditional on the population mean of the confouding variables X(1,2,3) are computed according to (3) and (7). Figure 1 presents the distribution of both estimators, which arise due to the 100, 000 simulation repetitions.

In our simulation both estimators report on average the same unbiased estimates, which however vary due to the introduced heteroscedasticity along the distribution of the conditional outcome variable Yi|Xi with the location parameter . For example, at  = 0.5 both approaches generate unbiased estimates of the ATE µZ,1 = 0.7, as cET E0.5 = 0.700 and cQT E0.5 = 0.704, but in the lower tail at  = 0.1 the mean cETE (cQTE) of 0.651 (0.652) is considerably lower than the reported 0.750 (0.757) at the upper tail location  = 0.9.

However there is also some visible variation present in the estimates and for example at  = 0.1 the variance of the expectile (quantile) treatment estimators amounts to 0.019 (0.027). As with the mean, the size of the variance varies with the location parameters , respectively  , as any treatment effects in the tails are more difficult to determine than the more centric ones.

from this specific feature of the applied estimation procedures, the observed variation is also caused by the stochastic data generating process and the specific parametrization.
In detail, a treatment group size of nt = 100 raises the variance sixfold (µZ,1 = 2.1) to tenfold (µZ,1 = 0.7), if compared to a treatment group of nt = 1000 observations. The same reasoning holds for the size of the control group, as a being able to compare the treatment group to a control group of only double its size increases the variance of the treatment estimate by 20% (µZ,1 = 2.1) to 30% (µZ,1 = 0.7) if compared with a control group of ten times the size of the treatment group. Whereas the existence of covariance among the confounding variable increases the variance only slightly by around 7% for all values of µZ,1, the incrases of the error's standard deviation from a quarter to a half of the standard deviation of all explanatory variables raises the variance sharply by 72% (µZ,1 = 0.7) to 103% (µZ,1 = 2.1). Finally our simulation indicates that the estimators' variances are positively correlated with the treatment size, as increasing the simulated treatment effect from µZ,1 = 0.7 to µZ,1 = 2.1 increases the variance by 36%. This observation might be explained by the resulting reduction in the essential overlap between both samples.
Apart from these general observations, which hold for both estimators, there persists, apart from extreme locations, a statistically significant difference between both estimators. As one may note in Figure 1, the density of the cETE estimator is visibly more concentrated on the mean than the density of the cQTE etimator, as the cETE estimates vary less than the cQTE estimates. However, this difference decreases with less centric locations and both estima-

tors can not be distinguished visually at extreme locations. Still this empirical finding of a predominately smaller variance of the cETE estimator supports and, via the broad parametrization, extends the theoretical arguments detailed above.
In order to quantify this difference Table 1 compares both estimators and reports the ratio  of the observed variance of the cETE estimates to the variance of the cQTE estimates
Var(cET E) =
Var(cQT E)
for several locations  and various simulated treatment effect sizes µZ,1.
Apart from extreme locations and one less pronounced occurrence at µZ,1 = 2.1 the cETE estimator possess in our simulation an at least 20% smaller variance than the cQTE estimator and under favourable conditions the variance of the cETE procedure amounts to only 2/3 of the cQTE equivalent. This substantial increase in efficiency is observable for all treatment values µZ,1, but decreases slightly as the treatment effect size is raised. However, this gain is neutralised in the extreme tails, where both estimating procedures result in comparable variances. In summary, these findings fit well with the theoretical results above and show, that the potential gain of cETE is substantial, whereas the efficiency loss in the extreme tail ends seems to be negligible.
4 Application
Given their nature cETE and cQTE only report conditional results, which restricts their usefulness in many cases. Their generalization is limited by the observation that for example in the case of quantiles F-1( ) = EX[F-1( )|X] and therefore their direct application to compute the more interesting unconditional effect of the treatment on the output variable is inhibited. Indeed a conditional treatment effect at the upper tail of Yi|Xi may describe an effect at the lower tail for unconditional Yi, if the particular Xi = xi values assign the observation to the lower tail of the unconditional distribution of Yi.

12

One remedy to overcome these restrictions is denoted by the adoption of quantile regression to the counterfactual decomposition approach (Gosling et al., 2000; Machado and Mata, 2005), which has for example been implemented to study the gender wage gap in Sweden (Albrecht et al., 2003) and wage inequality in the U.S. (Melly, 2005). The counterfactual decomposition framework (Juhn et al., 1993) divides the total difference between the treatment and control group into a confounding and a treatment effect, that is

FY 1|1 - FY 0|0 = FY 1|1 - FY 0|1 + FY 1|1 - FY 1|0 ,

(10)

where FY r|s (Y ) = FYr (Y |X) d FXs(X) denotes the distribution of the output variable Yi arsing from integrating the characteristics Xi out of the conditional distribution Yi|Xi and r, s  {0, 1} indicate the control, respectively treatment group. Hence this approach identifies the treatment and confouding
effect by allowing for a factual and counterfactual combination of characteristics Xi and valuation of these characteristics Yi|Xi.

Accordingly the first subtraction on the RHS in equation (10) denotes the treatment effect arising from a difference in the valuation of equal characteristics among control and treatment group, whereas the second subtraction describes the confounding effect caused by a difference between control and treatment group in their particular characteristics. Consequently the counterfactual decomposition denotes a variant of the Blinder≠Oaxaca decomposition (Blinder, 1973; Oaxaca, 1973) and we adapt expectile regression to this approach to study the classic LaLonde data set (LaLonde, 1986) on the effect of the National Supported Work (NSW) Demonstration programme.

The resulting unconditional quantile, respectively expectile treatment effect may be denoted as

uT E(l) = (FY 1|1 , l) - (FY 0|1 , l),

(11)

where (FY , l)  {F-Y 1(l), GY (l)} describes either a quantile or expectile at the location l  {,  } of the distribution of the outcome variable Yi. In order to estimate the factual and counterfactual densities in equation (11) we follow
the algorithm of Machado and Mata (2005) and note that instead of quantile
regression also expectile regression may be deployed to estimate the conditional distribution FYr (Y |X), as the estimated conditional expectile function also denotes a consistent estimator of the population expectile function and
may describe the conditional distribution in its entirety (Newey and Powell,
1987).

Given the argumentation by Dehejia and Wahba (1999) we restrict our analysis to those male observations with information on their pre≠treatment wage in 1975 and 1974 and consequently regress the 1978 wage linearly on age, education, an indicator for not possessing a degree, indicators for African Americans and Hispanic Americans, marital status and the aforementioned pre≠treatment wages. We also define the four observations earning more than 30, 000USD as outliers and exclude them beforehand. Due to the restricted number of observations, 259 control and 182 treatment observations, we set the number

of random draws in the algorithm to m = 150 and obtain a variation in the quantile and expectile estimation procedures via the same bootstrap samples arising from 1000 runs.
Due to the experimental character of the NSW data, we observe hardly any confounding effect at any location of the output variable. In addition the rather simplistic model and small set of confounding variables do not allow for the confouding effect and the displayed treatment effect to add up to the overall difference between both groups. A sizeable mean residual of up to 26% (ETE), respectively 28% (QTE) of the total difference can not be explained by the model and, together with the rather small number of observations, probably explain, why neither ETE nor QTE report average values close to the average treatment effect of 1314USD obtained by comparing the 1978 mean wage in the control and treatment group.
Figure 2 compares the estimates resulting from either applying quantile regression or expectile regression, where we compute quantiles, respectively expectiles on the locations  =  = {0.5, 0.15, . . . , 0.85, 0.95} for the factual and counterfactual margials. In detail, the left panel of Figure 2 is at first based on linear quantile regression to obtain the conditional distribution and secondly displays the difference in quantiles between the resulting factual and counterfactual marginals. Accordingly the right panel in Figure 2 is excluively based on linear expectile regression and expectiles of the resulting marginals.
Both procedures basically present the same results of an overall positive effect, which is rather small at the lower tail, but tripled at the upper tail. Consequently in absolute terms the NSW Demonstration programme benefited high
14

income earners stronger than low income earners. Comparing both procedures in Figure 2, it might be noted that due to its nature the ETE estimates present a much smoother picture. On the other hand QTE presents a broader picture as setting the same value for  and  results in more extreme tail locations for QTE than for ETE. This inherited behaviour of QTE and ETE from its distinct regression techniques complicates any direct comparison of the respective variances, as our simulation has shown that the variance increases in the tails. Neglecting this nuisance ETE presents a substantially smaller variance than QTE, as the sum of the standard deviations at the aforementioned locations by applying ETE amounts to only 71% of its QTE equivalent, well in line with our simulation results. In addition some bootstrap samples causes QTE to report treatment effects relatively far from its overall mean, whereas the corresponding ETE estimates stick much closer to the ETE average treatment effects.
5 Conclusion
Observing the distribution of a treatment effect instead of solely relying on an average facilitates the detection of deviant treatment effects in the tails. Quantile treatment effects and expectile treatment effects have both been shown to generate unbiased estimates and whereas quantile treatment effects have been applied frequently, expectile treatment effects denote a related, but novel technique with substantial advantages in terms of mean squared error.
Its smaller variance, if compared to quantile treatment effects, has been proven for the main chunk of the distribution, whereas in the more difficult extreme tail ends expectile treatment effects has been observed to be as efficient as quantile treatment effects. This performance stems from the predominately more efficient expectile regression estimation, which due to the potential outcome framework in the Rubin Causal Model affects the estimation of treatment effects twice, once in the estimation for the programme group and once in the equivalent procedure for the control group.
Furthermore, Schulze Waltrup et al. (2013) indicate that also in an experimental setting, in which confounding variables are balanced between both groups and can consequently be omitted, the application of expectiles could be advantageous. And finally the limitation to linear models throughout our study has been taken for simplicity and computation convenience. The difference in the contrast function between the exepctile and quantile approach is unaffected by the form of the regression model applied to estimate q , respectively e in the aforementioned optimization problems and consequently the observations made in the linear case should also carry over to more flexible non≠linear regression models.
Still in certain settings efficiency in mean squared error will not denote the only criterion to choose between expectile treatment effects and its quantile cousin. Whereas Koenker (2013) points out that in theory quantiles can be computed as fast as expectiles and therefore the slower computation of quan-
15

tiles is only due to the ease of implementing both approaches, the superior robustness of quantiles could favour the application of QTE. Contrary to expectiles, quantiles are hardly affected by any outliers and consequently expectile treatment effects may result in biased estimates, if such outliers are not excluded beforehand or the data is not well behaved. These observations will disproportionately affect the extreme tail ends, at which expectile treatment effects performs only on a par with quantile treatment effects even on standard data.
Hence, if the extreme tail ends are of particular interest, quantile treatment effects may present more reliable results. If on the other hand the entire treatment effect distribution is of concern and general observations on deviant treatment effects in the tails are of interest, than the more efficient expectile treatment effects seem to denote a reasonable choice. In these cases the missing intuitive indication of the exact location any chosen  defines seems irrelevant, as not a specific  is of interest, but several values and in particular the resulting distribution of the treatment effect. In many applications the analysis of the entire treatment distribution seems more expedient and under these circumstances expectile treatment effects propose an efficient alternative to the established quantile treatment effects.

A Proofs

A.1 Lemma 1
We assume Zi = {Yi, Xi}  identically and independently  i according to the c.d.f. F(Yi|Xi) and define a gaussian error term i  N(µ, 2), which is independent of the explanatory variables Xi. Furthermore we allow  and  to denote the same location and, if feasible, suppress the location subscript to simplify the notation.

Given the stated proposition

ACov  > ACov  ,

we can combine the definitions of the respective variances to the inequality

n -1 n

 (1 -  )

xi fi,(0)xi

xixi

i=1 i=1

n -1

◊ xi fi,(0)xi

i=1

n -1 n

> i xixi

xixi Var (i i)

i=1 i=1

n -1

◊

ixixi

,

i=1

where we separate the p.d.f. of the error fi,(0), respectively the expectation of the true individual weights i from the inverse summation terms due to
the i.i.d. assumption and subsequently reduce those summation terms:

 (1 -  ) f(0)-2

n
xixi
i=1

> (i )-2

n
xixi Var (ii)
i=1

.

16

Excluding the parameter i from the variance terms allows to cancel them and the independence between the error variance Var (i) = 2i and Xi allows to cancel the remaining summation terms. Entering the assumed functional
form of the error, the inequality becomes

 (1 -  )

 1 exp 2

- (0 - µ)2 22

-2
> 2,

which we can be solved for  to obtain the aforementioned solution for l,u as

l,u = 0.5 ±

exp 0.25 -

- µ2 2

.

A.2 Lemma 2
We assume a treatment effect in form of a global location change and allow as before  and  to jointly denote the same location on Yi|Xi.

The stated proposition AVar cET E < AVar cQT E
 AVar GY (1)() - GY (0)() < AVar FY-1(1)( ) - FY-1(0)( ) can be rewritten as a sum of variances due to the independent samples: AVar GY (1)() + AVar GY (0)() < AVar FY-1(1)( ) + AVar FY-1(0)( ) . Owning to the definition of the treatment effect, this inequality is fulfilled, if
AVar GY (∑)() < AVar F-Y 1(∑)( )  X ACov  X < X ACov  X  ACov  < ACov  , which has been shown to hold given the conditions stated in lemma 1.
