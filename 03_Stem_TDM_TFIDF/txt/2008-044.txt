Abstract
Market option prices in last 20 years confirmed deviations from the Black and Scholes (BS) models assumptions, especially on the BS implied volatility. Implied binomial trees (IBT) models capture the variations of the implied volatility known as "volatility smile". They provide a discrete approximation to the continuous risk neutral process for the underlying assets. In this paper, we describe the numerical construction of IBTs by Derman and Kani (DK) and an alternative method by Barle and Cakici (BC). After the formation of IBT we can estimate the implied local volatility and the state price density (SPD). We compare the SPD estimated by the IBT methods with a conditional density computed from a simulated diffusion process. In addition, we apply the IBT to EUREX option prices and compare the estimated SPDs. Both IBT methods coincide well with the estimation from the simulated process, though the BC method shows smaller deviations in case of high interest rate, particularly.

10 Numerics of Implied Binomial Trees
Wolfgang Ha®rdle and Alena Mysickova¥
For about 20 years now, discrepancies between market option prices and Black and Scholes (BS) prices have widened. The observed market option price showed that the BS implied volatility, computed from the market option price by inverting the BS formula varies with strike price and time to expiration. These variations are known as "the volatility smile (skew)" and volatility term structure, respectively.
In order to capture the dependence on strike and time to maturity, various smile-consistent models (based on an arbitrage-free approach), have been proposed in the literature. One approach is to model the volatility as a stochastic process, see Hull and White (1987) or Derman and Kani (1998); another works with discontinuous jumps in the stock price, see Merton (1976). However, these extensions cause several practical difficulties such as the violation of the risk-neutrality or no-arbitrage. In contrast, more recent publications proposed by Rubinstein (1994), Derman and Kani (1994), Dupire (1994), and Barle and Cakici (1998) have introduced a locally deterministic volatility function that varies with market price and time. These models independently construct a discrete approximation to the continuous risk neutral process for the underlying assets in the form of binomial or trinomial trees. These deterministic volatility models have both practical and theoretical advantages: they are easily realisable and preserve the no-arbitrage idea inherent in the BS model.
The implied binomial tree (IBT) method constructs a numerical procedure which is consistent with the smile effect and the term structure of the implied volatility. The IBT algorithm is a data adaptive modification of the Cox, Ross and Rubinstein (1979)(CRR) method where the stock evolves along a risk neutral binomial tree with constant volatility.
The following three requirements should be minimally satisfied by an IBT:
correct reproduction of the volatility smile
node transition probabilities lying in [0, 1]-intervall only
risk neutral branching process (forward price of the underlying asset equals the conditional expected value of itself) at each step.

210 Wolfgang H®ardle and Alena Mysickova¥
The last two conditions also guarantee no-arbitrage; should the stock price fall below or above its corresponding forward price, the transition probability would exceed the [0, 1]-interval.
The basic aim of the IBT is the estimation of implied probability distributions, or state price densities (SPD), and local volatility surfaces. Furthermore, the IBT may evaluate the future stock price distributions according to the BS implied volatility surfaces which are calculated from observed daily market European option prices.
In this chapter, we describe the numerical construction of the IBT and compare the predicted implied price distributions. In Section 10.1, a detailed construction of the IBT algorithm for European options is presented. First, we introduce the Derman and Kani (1994) (DK) algorithm and show its possible drawbacks. Afterwards, we follow an alternative IBT algorithm by Barle and Cakici (1998) (BC), which modifies the DK method by a normalisation of the central nodes according to the forward price in order to increase its stability in the presence of high interest rates. In Section 10.2 we compare the SPD estimations with simulated conditional density from a diffusion process with a non-constant volatility. In the last section, we apply the IBT to a real data set containing underlying asset price, strike price, time to maturity, interest rate, and call/put option price from EUREX (Deutsche Bo®rse Database). We compare the SPD estimated by real market data with those predicted by the IBT.

10.1 Construction of the IBT

In the early 1970s, Black and Scholes presented the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model, where the stock price St is a solution of the stochastic differential equation (SDE):

dSt St

=

µdt

+ dWt

,

(10.1)

with a standard Wiener process Wt and the constant instantaneous drift µ. The constant instantaneous volatility function  measures the return variability around its expectation µ. Using a risk neutral measure Q, see Fengler (2005), the BS pricing formulae for european call and put options are:

Ct = e-r EQ{max(ST - K, 0)} Pt = e-r EQ{max(K - ST , 0)} .

(10.2) (10.3)

Under these relations the underlying at the expiration date follows a conditional lognormal distribution with density:



q(ST |St,

r,

=

1 ST 22

exp

- 

log

ST St

-

(r

-

2 2

)

22

2 . 

(10.4)

In the upper equations T is the expiration date, St is the stock price at time t,  = T - t is time to maturity, K is the strike price and r is the riskless interest rate.
Looking at a general SDE for an underlying asset price process:

dSt St

=

µ(St, t)dt +

(St, t, ∑)dWt

,

(10.5)

we can differentiate the following three concepts of volatility, see Fengler (2005):

Instantaneous volatility (St, t, ∑)
measures the instantaneous standard deviation of log St depends on the current level of the asset price St, time t and possibly on other state variables denoted with `∑'.
Implied volatility t(K, T )
the BS option price implied measure of volatility, the instantaneous standard deviation of log St the volatility parameter corresponds to the BS price and a particular observed market option price
depends on the strike K, the expiration date T and time t.
Local volatility K,T (St, t)
expected instantaneous volatility conditional on a particular level of the asset price ST = K at t = T In a deterministic model we can write K,T (St, t) = (K, T ).
The CRR binomial tree is constructed as a discrete approximation of a GBM process with a constant instantaneous volatility t(St, t) = . Analogously, the IBT can be viewed as a discretization of an instantaneous volatility model:

dSt St

=

µtdt

+

(St, t)dWt,

(10.6)

212 Wolfgang H®ardle and Alena Mysickova¥
where (St, t) depends on both the underlying price and time. The purpose of the IBT is to construct a discrete implementation of the extended BS model based on the observed option prices yielding the variable volatility (St, t). In addition, the IBT may reflect a non-constant drift µt. After the construction of the IBT, we are able to estimate a local volatility from underlying stock prices and transition probabilities.
In the IBT construction, only observable data (market option prices, underlying prices, interest rate) are used, it is therefore nonparametric in nature. Several alternative studies based on the kernel method, A®it-Sahalia and Lo (1998), or nonparametric constrained least squares, Yatchew and Ha®rdle (2006), and curve-fitting methods, Jackwerth and Rubinstein (1996) have been published in recent years.

10.1.1 The Derman and Kani Algorithm

In the DK IBT approach, stock prices, transition probabilities and ArrowDebreu prices (discounted risk neutral probabilities) are calculated iteratively level by level, starting in the level zero.

levels, t apart. We start at zero level with t = 0, here the stock price equals the current price of the underlying: S00 = S. There are n + 1 nodes at the nth level of the tree, we indicate the stock price of the ith node at the nth level by Sni , and the forward price at level n + 1 of Sni at level n by Fni = er tSni . The conditional probability pni+1 = P(Sn+1 = Sni++11|Sn = Sni ) is the transition probability of making a transition from node (n, i) to node (n + 1, i + 1).

The forward price Fn,i is required to satisfy the risk neutral condition:

Fni = pin+1Sni++11 + (1 - pin+1)Sni +1 .

(10.7)

Thus we obtain the transition probability from the following equation:

pni+1

=

Fni - Sni +1 Sni++11 - Sni +1

.

(10.8)

The Arrow-Debreu price is the price of an option which pays 1 unit payoff
if the stock price St at time t attains the value Sni , and 0 otherwise. The Arrow-Debreu price in the state i at level n can be computed as the expected discounted value of its payoff: in = E[e-rt1(St = Sni )|S0 = S00]. In general, Arrow-Debreu prices can be obtained by the iterative formula, where 00 = 1 as a definition.

0n+1 = e-r t n0 (1 - pn1 ) in++11 = e-r t ni pin+1 + in+1(1 - pin+2) , 0  i  n - 1 nn++11 = e-r t {nnpnn+1}

(10.9)

To illustrate the calculation of the Arrow-Debreu prices, we provide an example with a construction of a CRR binomial tree. Let us assume that the current value of the underlying S = 100, time to maturity  = T = 2 years,
t = 1 year, constant volatility  = 10%, and riskless interest rate r = 0.03. The Arrow-Debreu price tree shown in the Figure 10.3 can be calculated from the stock price tree in the Figure 10.2.
Using the CRR method, the stock price at the lower node at the first level equals S10 = S00 ∑ e- t = 100 ∑ e-0.1 = 90.52, and at the upper node S11 = S00 ∑ e t = 110.47. The transition probability p10 = 0.61 is obtained by the formula (10.8) with F00 = S00e0.03 = 103.05. Now, we calculate 1i for i = 0, 1, according to the formula (10.9): 10 = e-r t ∑ 00 ∑ (1 - p01) = 0.36 and 11 = e-r t ∑ 00 ∑ p10 = 0.61. At the second level, we calculate the stock prices according to the corresponding nodes at the first level, for example: S20 = S10 ∑ e- t = 81.55, S21 = S00 = 100 and S22 = S11 ∑ e t = 122.04.

The corresponding Arrow-Debreu prices 2i for i = 0, 1, 2 are obtained by the substitution in the formula 10.9:

02 = e-r 21 = e-r 22 = e-r

In the BS model with the state price density (SPD) from 10.4, the option

10 Numerics of Implied Binomial Trees prices are given by:

C(K,  ) = e-r P (K,  ) = e-r

max(ST - K, 0) q(ST |St, r,  )dST ,
0 +
max(K - ST , 0) q(ST |St, r,  )dST ,
0

(10.10) (10.11)

where C(K,  ) and P (K,  ) denote call option price and put option price respectively, and K is the strike price. In the IBT, option prices are calculated in discrete time intervals  = n t using the Arrow-Debreu prices,

C(K, n P (K, n

(10.12) (10.13)

Using the risk neutral condition (10.7) and the discrete option price calculation from (10.12) or (10.13), one obtains the iteration formulae to construct the IBT.
Let us assume the strike price is equal to the known stock price: K = Sni = S. Then the contribution from the transition to the first in-the-money upper node can be separated from the other contributions. Using the iterative formulae for the Arrow-Debreu prices (10.9) in the equation (10.12):

n
+ jn 1 - pnj+1 (Snj+1 - S) + pjn+1(Snj++11 - S)

.

j=i+1

Entering the risk neutral condition (10.7) in the last term, one obtains:

n

er tC(S, n t) = ni pin+1 Sni++11 - S +

jn Fnj - S .

j=i+1

(10.14)

Now, the stock price for the upper node can be rewritten in terms of the known Arrow-Debreu prices ni , the known stock prices Sni and the known forwards Fni:

(10.16)

The transition from the nth to the (n + 1)th level of the tree is defined by (2n + 3) parameters, i.e. (n + 2) stock prices of the nodes at the (n + 1)th

10 Numerics of Implied Binomial Trees

217

level, and (n + 1) transition probabilities (when the IBT starts at the zero-
level). Suppose (2n+1) parameters corresponding to the nth level are known, the stock prices Sni +1 and transition probabilities pni+1 at all nodes above the centre of the tree corresponding to the (n +1)th level can be found iteratively
using the equations (10.15) and (10.8) as follows:
We always start from the central nodes, if n is odd, define Sni +1 = S00 = S, for i = (n + 1)/2. If n is even, we start from the two central nodes just below and above the centre of the level, Sni +1 and Sni++11 for i = n/2, and set Sni +1 = (Sni )2/Sni++11 = S2/Sni++11, which adjusts the logarithmic CRR centring spacing between Sni and Sni++11 to be the same as that between Sni and Sni +1. Substituting this relation into (10.15) one gets the formula for the upper of
the two central nodes for the odd levels:

Sni++11

=

S

C (S, n ni Fni - er

t) er t + tC (S, n

ni S - u t) + u

n for i = .

(10.17)

Once we have the initial nodes' stock prices, according to the relationships among the different parameters, we can repeat the process to calculate those at higher nodes (n + 1, j), j = i + 2, . . . n + 1 one by one.

Similarly, we can calculate the parameters at lower nodes (n + 1, j), j =
i - 1, . . . , 1 at the (n + 1)th level by using the known put prices P (K, n t) for K = Sni .

Sni +1

=

Sni++11 er

er tP (Sni , n t) - l - ni Sni (Fni - Sni++11) tP {Sni , (n + 1) t} - l + in(Fni - Sni++11)

,

(10.18)

where l denotes the sum over all nodes below the one with price Sni :

i-1
l = nj (Sni - Fnj) .
j=0

(10.19)

Transition probabilities and Arrow-Debreu prices are obtained by (10.8) and (10.9), respectively.
C(K,  ) and P (K,  ) in (10.15) and (10.18) are the interpolated values for a call or put struck today at strike price K and time to maturity  . In the DK construction, they are obtained by the CRR binomial tree with constant parameters  = imp(K,  ), calculated from the known market option prices. In practice, calculating interpolated option prices by the CRR method is computationally intensive.

218 Wolfgang Ha®rdle and Alena Mysickova¥

10.1.2 Compensation

The transition probability pni at any node should lie between 0 and 1, this condition avoids the riskless arbitrage: if pni+1 > 1, the stock price Sni++11 would fall below the forward price Fni, similarly, if pin+1 < 0, the strike price Sni +1 would fall above the forward price Fni. Therefore it is useful to limit the estimated stock prices by the neighbouring forwards from the previous level:

Fni < Sni++11 < Fni+1 .

(10.20)

If the stock price does not fulfil the above inequality condition, we rede-
fine it by assuming that the logaritmic difference between the stock prices
at this node and its adjacent is equal to the logaritmic difference between
the corresponding stock prices at the two nodes at the previous level, i.e., log(Sni++11/Sni +1) = log(Sni /Sni-1). Sometimes, the obtained price still does not satisfy inequality (10.20), then we substitute the stock price Sni++11 by the average of Fni and Fni+1.

As used in the construction of the IBT in (10.12) or (10.13), the implied conditional distribution, the SPD q(ST |St, r,  ), could be estimated at discrete time  = n t by the product of the Arrow-Debreu prices in+1 at the (n+1)th level with the influence of the interest rate ern t. To fulfill the risk-neutrality
condition (10.7), the conditional expected value of the underlying log stock
price in the following (n + 1)th level, given the stock price at the nth level is
defined as:

M = EQ{log(Sn+1)|Sn = Sni } = pni+1 log(Sni++11)+(1-pni+1) log(Sni +1) . (10.21)

We can specify such a condition also for the conditional second moments of log(Sn+1) at Sn = Sni , which is the implied local volatility 2(Sni , n t) during the time period t:

2(Sni ,

t) = VarQ{log(Sn+1)|Sn = Sni }

= pni+1{log(Sni++11) - M }2 + (1 - pni+1){log(Sni +1) - M }2

= 2 log

Sni++11 Sni +1

{pni+1(1 - pin+1)} .

(10.22)

After the construction of an IBT, all stock prices, transition probabilities, and Arrow-Debreu prices at any node in the tree are known. We are thus able to calculate the local volatility (Sni , m t) at any level m.
In general, the instantaneous volatility function used in the diffusion model (10.6) is different from the local volatility function derived in (10.22), only in the BS model are they identical. Additional, the BS implied volatility

10 Numerics of Implied Binomial Trees

219

(K,  ), which assumes the Black-Scholes model at least locally, differs from the local volatility (s,  ), they describe different characteristics of the second moment using different parameters.
If we choose t small enough, we obtain the estimated SPD at fixed time to maturity, and the distribution of local volatility (S,  ).

10.1.3 Barle and Cakici Algorithm

Barle and Cakici (1998) (BC) suggest an improvement of the DK construc-
tion. The first major modification is the choice of the strike price in which
the option should be evaluated (as in 10.14). In the BC algorithm, the strike price K is chosen to be equal to the forward price Fni, and similarly to the DK construction, using the discrete approximation (10.12) we get:

er tC(Fni, n

n

t) =

nj++11 max(Snj++11 - Fni, 0)

j=0

= inpni+1 + in+1(1 - pin+2) (Sni++11 - Fni) + nnpnn+1(Snn++11 - Fni)

n-1
+ nj pnj+1 + nj+1 1 - pnj+2 (Snj++11 - Fni)

j=i+1

= ni pni+1(Sni++11 - Fni)
n
+ nj 1 - pnj+1 (Snj+1 - Fni) + pnj+1(Snj++11 - Fni)

.

j=i+1

Entering the risk neutral condition again (10.7) one obtains:

n

er tC(Fni, n t) = inpni+1 Sni++11 - Fni +

nj Fnj - Fni .

j=i+1

(10.23)

Identify the upper sum as:

n
u = jn Fnj - Fni
j=i+1

,

(10.24)

and using the equation for the transition probability (10.8) we can write the recursion relation for the stock price in the upper node as follows:

Sni++11

=

Sni +1

C Fni, n C (Fni, n

t er t) er t

t- u - u-

- ni Fni Fni - ni Fni - Sni +1

Sni +1

.

(10.25)

220 Wolfgang H®ardle and Alena Mysickov¥a

Analogous to the DK construction, we start from the central nodes of the
binomial tree, but in contrast with the DK construction the BC construction
takes the riskless interest rate into account. If (n + 1) is even, the price of the central node Sni +1 = S00er t for i = (n + 1)/2. If (n + 1) is odd, the two central nodes must satisfy Sni +1 ∑ Sni++11 = (Fni)2. Adding this condition to the equation (10.25) the lower central node can be calculated as:

Sni +1

=

Fni

ni Fni ni Fni

- +

{er {er

tC(Fni, n tC(Fni, n

t) - t) -

u} u}

for i = 1 + n/2,

(10.26)

the upper one is then: Sni++11 = (Fni)2/Sni +1.

After stock prices of the central nodes are obtained, we repeat the recursion equation (10.25) to calculate the stock prices at higher nodes (n + 1, j), j = i + 2, . . . , n + 1. The transition probabilities and Arrow-Debreu prices are calculated through (10.8) and (10.9), respectively.

Similarly, an analogous recursion relation for the stock prices at lower nodes can be found by using put option prices at strike Fni:

Sni +1

=

Sni++11{P (Fni, n t)er t P (Fni, n t)er t -

-
l

l}inFni(Sni++11 - Fni) - in(Sni++11 - Fni)

,

(10.27)

where where l denotes the lower sum:

i-1
l = nj (Fni - Fnj) .
j=0

Notice that BC use the Black-Scholes call and put option prices C(K,  ) and P (K,  ), which makes the calculation faster than the interpolation technique based on the CRR method.
The balancing inequality (10.20), to avoid negative transition probabilities, and therewith the arbitrage is still used in the BC algorithm: they re-estimate Sni++11 by the average of Fni and Fni+1, though the choice of any point between these forward prices is sufficient.

10.2 A Simulation and a Comparison of the SPDs
The following detailed example illustrates the construction of the tree from the smile, using the DK algorithm first, and the BC algorithm afterwards.

Let us assume that the current value of the underlying stock S = 100, with

no dividend and the annually compounded riskless interest rate r = 3% per

year for all time expirations. For the implied volatility function, we use a

convex function:

-0.2  = {log(K/St)}2 + 1 + 0.3 ,

(10.28)

taken from Fengler (2005). For simplicity, we do not model a term structure

of the implied volatility. The BS option prices needed for growing the tree

are calculated from this implied volatility function. We construct the IBTs

with time to maturity T = 1 year discretized in five time steps.

10.2.1 Simulation Using the DK Algorithm
Using the assumption on the BS implied volatility surface described above, we obtain the one year stock price implied binomial tree (Figure 10.4), the upward transition probability tree (Figure 10.5), and the Arrow-Debreu price tree (Figure 10.6).

Notice that by the definition of the Arrow-Debreu price, the risk neutral probability corresponding to each node should be calculated as the product of the Arrow-Debreu price and the factor erj t in the level j.
Choosing the time steps small enough, we obtain more accurate estimation of the implied price distribution and the local volatility surface (S,  ). We

still use the same implied volatility function from (10.28), and assume S00 = 100 , r = 0.03 , T = 5 years.
SPD estimation arising from fitting the implied five-year tree with 40 levels is shown in Figure 10.7. Local volatility surface computed from the implied tree at different times to maturity and stock price levels is shown in Figure 10.8. Obviously, the local volatility captures the volatility smile, which decreases with the strike price and increases with the time to maturity.

10.2.2 Simulation Using the BC Algorithm
The BC algorithm can be applied in analogy to the DK technique. The computing part is replaced by the BC algorithm, we are using the implied volatility function from (10.28) as in the DK algorithm. Figures 10.9 - 10.11 show the one-year stock price tree with five steps, transition probability tree, and Arrow-Debreu tree. Figure 10.12 presents the plot of the estimated SPD by fitting a five year implied binomial tree with 40 levels using BC algorithm. Figure 10.13 shows the characteristics of the local volatility surface of the generated IBT, the local volatility follows the "volatility smile", which decreases with the stock price and increases with time.

Compared to Sections 10.2.2 and 10.2.2 where we started from the BS implied volatility surface, here we construct the IBTs direct from the simulated option price function. In the construction of the IBTs, we calculate the option prices

From the estimated distribution shown in Figure 10.14, we observe small deviations of the SPDs obtained from the two IBT methods from the estimation obtained by the Monte-Carlo simulation. The SPD estimation by the BC algorithm coincides substantially better with the estimation from the simulated process than the estimation by the DK algorithm, which shows a shifted mean of its SPD.
As above, we can also estimate the local volatility surface from the both implied binomial trees. Compare Figure 10.15 with Figure 10.16 and notice that some edge values cannot be obtained directly from the five-year IBT. However, both local volatility surface plots actually coincide with the volatility smile characteristic, the implied local volatility of the out-the-money options decreases with the increasing stock price, and increases with time.

10.3 Example ≠ Analysis of EUREX Data
In the following example we use the IBTs to estimate the price distribution of the real stock market data. We use underlying asset prices, strike prices, time to maturity, interest rates, and call/put option prices from EUREX at 19

of Fengler, H®ardle and Villa (2003). Figure 10.17 shows the estimated implied volatility surface, which reflects the characteristics that the implied volatility decreases with the strike price and increases with time to maturity.
Now we construct the IBTs, where we calculate the interpolated option prices with the CRR binomial tree method using the estimated implied volatility. Fitting the function of option prices directly from the market option prices causes difficulties since the function approaches a value of zero for very high strike prices which would violate no-arbitrage conditions.
The estimated stock price distribution, obtained by the BC and the DK IBT with 40 levels, for  = 0.5 year, is shown in Figure 10.18. Obviously, the both estimated SPDs are nearly identical. The SPDs do not show any deviations from the log-normal characteristics according to their skewness and kurtosis.
From the simulations and real data example, we conclude that the implied binomial tree is a simple smile-consistent method to assess the future stock prices. Still, some limitations of the algorithms remain. With an increasing interest rate or with a small time step, negative transition probabilities occur more often. When the interest rate is high, the BC algorithm is a better choice. The DK algorithm cannot handle with higher interest rates such as r = 0.2, in this case the BC algorithm still can be used. In addition, the negative probabilities appear more rarely in the BC algorithm than in

the DK construction, even though most of them appear at the edge of the trees. But, by modifying these values we are effectively losing the information about the volatility behavior at the corresponding nodes. This deficiency is a consequence of our condition that continuous diffusion process is modeled as a discrete binomial process. Improving of this requirement leads to a transition to multinomial or varinomial trees which have a drawback of more complicated models with difficult realization.
Besides its basic function to price derivatives in consistency with market prices, IBTs are also useful for hedging, calculating local volatility surfaces or estimation of the future price distribution according to the historical data. In the practical application, the reliability of the approach depends critically on the quality of the dynamics estimation of the underlying process, such as of the BS implied volatility surface obtained from the market option prices.
