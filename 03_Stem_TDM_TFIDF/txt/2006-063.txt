Abstract We consider the problem of optimal consumption for an investor who is risk and uncertainty avers. We model these preferences of the investor with the help of a convex risk-measure. Apart from consumption the agent has the possibility to invest initial capital and random endowment in a market where stock-prices are semimartingales. We formulate this as a maximin problem that will be solved by duality methods. keywords: duality theory; risk measures; optimal consumption; model uncertainty AMS classification 91B16, 62C20 JEL classification D11, D81
1 Introduction
Starting in 1969, 1971 with the works by Merton [19], [20] the problem of optimal investment has become one of the major research areas in mathematical finance. Merton and many of the following authors determined the optimal financial position with respect to expected utility but expected utility does not reflect preferences correctly in situations where model uncertainty is present. Therefore, Gilboa and Schmeidler [9] extended the model by incorporating Knightian

uncertainty which resulted in a robust approach. One possible interpretation of this approach is

that the agent takes a class of possible models into consideration and decides for the worst-case

outcome. This interpretation also explains why it is useful to extend the robust approach to an

evaluation via risk measures: the agent will typically have some assessment of the different models

(for instance she might use estimated data for the model specification and while she does not assume

her estimates to be correct she believes values close to the estimates to be more likely than values

far off). It is possible to include this assessment by the introduction of a penalty function, which

allows to weight the impact of a model according to its plausibility. In Maccheroni et al. [18] a set

of axioms is given yielding these preferences.

The non-robust problem of optimal terminal wealth was considered by several authors who

discussed different aspects of the problem. For example Kramkov and Schachermayer [16], [17]

characterized solutions of this problem in a general setting using duality methods. There exist

many extensions of this problem, e.g. Cvitani´c et al. [5], Karatzas and Zitkovic [15], or Hugonnier

and Kramkov [14] consider the case where the agent optimizes the consumption process and also

receives some kind of additional random endowment.

In [23], [25] and [10] the robust problem (without penalty term) was solved, also via the duality

or martingale method. Furthermore, there are papers where the authors assume more specific

market models and preferences and are therefore able to compute not just the optimal financial

position but also the optimal investment strategy: See [7] for a stochastic control approach for a

model with random endowment or [22] for computation of the optimal strategy in a robust setting.

In [2] or [21] a optimal investment problem is solved using BSDE's. Also the robust problem with

a penalty term was considered, among others by Hansen and Sargent [11], and Bordigoni et al.[3]

for an entropic penalty term and by Herna´ndez-Hern´andez and Schied [13] for a general penalty

term.

In this paper we will investigate the problem of optimal consumption in a general semimartingale

framework where the agent may invest in the stock market and receives additional random endow-

ment. She evaluates positions by a robust utility functional described through a utility function U

and a penalty term . More specifically the agent tries to maximize

over all possible consumption rate processes c. First the dual function for this problem is given

and then we examine properties and relations between primal and dual problem, e.g. we will show

2

that both problems have a solution and are conjugate to one another. Next we will verify that the above maximin problem and the corresponding minimax problem are equivalent.
In the long run we would like to compute explicitely the optimal consumption plan and investment strategy with the help of stochastic control methods (compare [13] or [12]). These techniques are - even in the nonrobust case - easier to apply to the dual problem than to the primal problem. In the robust case the primal problem becomes a maximin problem, i.e. we need to find a saddlepoint whereas the dual problem can still be solved through pure minimization. Hence, if we want to use stochastic control techniques it is sensible to examine the dual problem first. Furthermore, the duality results are also valid for preferences that are not dynamically consistent.
The problem is motivated by [24] where Schied considers the problem of optimal terminal wealth with respect to a convex risk measure in a setting without random endowment. We extend this problem by introducing a concept of consumption, general enough to include also the maximization of terminal wealth, and additional random endowment (compare [15]). In contrast to the problem of optimal terminal wealth, the problem of optimal consumption does not admit an equivalent static version. Hence, we cannot restrict ourselves to random variables to solve the primal problem, but need to work with stochastic processes. Furthermore, our dual problem is different from the dual problem in [24] or [15] due to random endowment on the one hand and robustification on the other. These differences imply for instance that there are cases where, given the dual solution (Q, R), R is no longer a solution to the associated dual problem under the model Q. Aspects regarding the dual function will be discussed in more detail in the third section. Robustification changes the problem of optimal consumption also significantly with respect to the optimization procedure since we consider a maximin instead of just a maximization problem. This extension yields some new results and partly we give new proofs for known results.
In [4] Burgert and Ru¨schendorf also consider a robust version of [15]. The most obvious difference to our setting is that we deal with preferences given by convex instead of just coherent risk measures. Furthermore Burgert and Ru¨schendorf work under the serious restriction that the set Q should only consist of measures that are equivalent to P and have a uniformly bounded density. The first assumption rules out risk measures such as AVaR, the second standard dynamic consistent coherent utility functionals in a Brownian setting such as used in [13].
In the next section we will introduce the market setting and describe the agent's preferences in more detail before we state our main theorem and give an example. In the third section we will derive our dual problem and prove the statements of the theorem related to it. Finally, in the
3

fourth section we will finish the proof of the theorem.

2 Notations and main results

We consider an agent who wants to maximize her utility from consumption between time zero and

some finite time horizon T . She is endowed with an initial capital and receives additional random

endowment over time, which she may invest into d assets. To formalize this problem we use the same market model as Karatzas and Zitkovi´c [15]. That means we model the price process of

the assets as a d-dimensional RCLL semi-martingale on (, F , (Ft)0tT , P ) where the filtration satisfies the usual conditions. The financial market is assumed to be arbitrage-free in the sense

that the set M of supermartingale measures equivalent to P is not empty. The portfolio process

is denoted by  = (t)0tT , and we allow only those strategies for which

t 0

u

dSu

is

bounded

from below by some constant.1 The initial capital is denoted by x and the random endowment

is described as a nondecreasing, adapted, RCLL process E = (Et)0tT with ET  L(P ). The

consumption process C = (Ct)0tT is assumed to be a nonnegative, nondecreasing and adapted

RCLL process. More specifically we will only deal with consumption processes that can be written

as Ct =

t 0

cs

µ(ds)

where

µ

is

a

probability

measure

on

[0, 1]

which

is

diffuse

on

[0, 1).

This

means

we assume that the agent consumes in a continuous way except for the final time T where we also

allow for lump consumption. In particular we can choose µ = {T } which accords to the problem of optimizing terminal wealth.

The terminal wealth is required to be non-negative:

T
x + ET + t dSt - CT  0
0

P - a.s.

(1)

We denote by A(x, µ) the set of consumption process densities (ct)0tT , for which an admissible strategy exists, such that condition (1) is fulfilled.

The utility from consumption is measured in terms of a robust utility functional of the form

T

c - inf
QP

EQ

U (t, ct) µ(dt) + (Q) .

(2)

This approach is called robust since such utility functionals are useful to deal with model uncertainty

[9, 18]. The penalty function  enables us to influence how serious a model should be taken. The

(Y ) := sup EQ[ -Y ] - (Q) ,

Y  L(P ).

(3)

More precisely the penalty function  is supposed to be bounded from below and equal to the

minimal penalty function of the convex risk measure above, which means, that it satisfies the

biduality relation

(Q) = sup EQ[ -Y ] - (Y ) .
Y L(P )
Furthermore we need the following conditions on ; compare [24, Assumption 2.1].

(4)

Assumption 2.1 We assume that the risk measure  is continuous from below, i.e. for a sequence (Yn)  L increasing a.s. to some Y  L, we have (Yn)  (Y ). Furthermore,  needs to be sensitive in the sense that (Y ) is strictly positive for all Y  L- \ {0}.

We work with a utility function U : [0, T ] × R+  R with the properties assumed in Definition 3.1 of [15].

Assumption 2.2 More precisely, for fixed t  [0, T ] we request U (t, .) : R+  R to be a utility function, i.e. U (t, ·)

is strictly concave, increasing, continuously differentiable and satisfies the Inada conditions.

The marginal utility is assumed to be bounded by the strictly decreasing continuous functions

K1 and K2, such that K1(x)  Ux(t, x)  K2(x) and

lim sup K2(x)/K1(x) < .
x
The map t  U (t, 1) is bounded and

lim inf U (t, x) > 0.
x t[0,T ]

Additionally U is supposed to be of reasonable asymptotic elasticity, i.e.

lim sup

To avoid problems of evaluating EQ

from below it is sensible to restrict the set of measures that enter the optimization problem to

for arbitrary F  L0.

(5)

In doing so we keep the functional (ct)0tT - EQ[

concave.

In the following we will use UQ(c) to abbreviate EQ

T 0

U (t,

µ(dt)

.

We define the value

function of the maximization problem as follows

u(x) = sup inf
c A(x,µ) QQ

UQ(c) + (Q)

.

(6)

Hence, the investor needs to solve a maximin problem in order to find u. Another approach to

the optimization problem is to solve the problem in each possible model, i.e. compute uQ(x) = supcA(x,µ) UQ(c) for each Q  Q and then robustify the result by taking the infimum. We will show that both methods lead to the same result, namely

u(x) = QinfQ(uQ(x) + (Q)).
Sometimes it will be more convenient to work with densities than measures. We denote the density of Q with respect to P on FT by ZQ = dQ/dP and the set {ZQ | Q  Q} by Z. We will identify Q and ZQ, and thus write (ZQ) (Q) and (ZQ) or uQ and uZQ denote the same object. While we write ZQ for dQ/dP |FT we will denote the corresponding density process by (ZtQ)0tT .
We will use the dual (or martingale) approach to characterize the solution to our optimization problem. A downside of the dual method is that it does not directly give the investment strategy  which is necessary in order to realize the optimal consumption plan. In some cases this strategy can be determined using stochastic control techniques, compare e.g. [13] or [22]. These authors also argue that the dual problem is easier to treat than the primal problem which shows that our results are still useful. Furthermore, in our case we did not restrict the form of the penalty function, therefore our approach covers also the cases where time consistency is lacking and hence optimal control techniques cannot be applied (see [24]).
In general the dual problem is an associated minimization problem where the dual domain is related to the set of equivalent martingale measures. As was shown in [5] and [15] we need to use D, the weak*-closure of the set of equivalent supermartingale measures M, as dual domain. More precisely, we identify the set M with its embedding in the dual of L(P ), (L(P )). Then D is the ((L(P )), L(P ))-closure of M. The set D contains also finitely-additive measures to which we cannot directly associate a density process. Therefore, we use that each R in D has a unique

6

Hewitt-Yosida decomposition Rr + Rs where the regular part Rr is the maximal countable measure

on F that is dominated by R. Hence, we can for each R  D define a supermartingale LR, where

LRt is the density of the regular part (R|Ft)r of R|Ft with respect to P |Ft. In the following we will work with the RCLL supermartingale Y R that coincides with LR for all t  Q  [0, T ]. For a proof

of the existence of Y R and further properties of Y and D see [15]. We need as further notation

R, ET which gives the canonical pairing. Observe that in particular R, I = 1.

Remark 2.3

In the introduction convex risk measures where interpreted as a worst-case approach for different

scenarios Q. Using this interpretation it seems sensible to formulate the market restrictions under

each measure Q but we formulated the assumptions for the market and the trading strategy with

respect to the measure P . (In particular the dual domain depends on the measure we use to give

the capital constraint (1).) One reason why we use P is that we use the convex risk measure as

a model for the agent's preferences, not as a model of the "real" market. Furthermore, the worst-

case measure may allow for arbitrage, compare [24, Example 3.2]. Hence, to exclude arbitrage

opportunities it is necessary to formulate the admissibility condition under P .

Nevertheless, for all Q out of Qe := {Q  Q | Q  P } we have the conditions necessary to apply standard duality results. (Lemma 3.3 will guarantee that Qe is non-empty.)

Assumption 2.4

In the following we will assume that there exists Q0  Qe that satisfies

uQ0(x) <  for some x > 0.
This is a similar assumption as is needed in [15] to guarantee the existence of solutions to both the primal and the dual problems under the subjective probability measure Q0. Furthermore we

7

can conclude that uQ0 and vQ0 are dual functions [15, Theorem 3.10]. We will show that we have similar results in our robust setting. Theorem 2.5 Under the above assumption the following assertions are valid.

1. Both value functions u and v take only finite values and satisfy u(-) = 0 and v(0+) = -,

(8)

u is strictly concave and v is continuously differentiable.

2. The value function u satisfies

u(x) = sup inf
c A(x,µ) QQ

UQ(c) + (Q)

= inf
QQ

sup UQ(c) + (Q)
c A(x,µ)

.

3. The two value functions u and v are conjugate to another:

u(x) = inf v(y) + xy
y>0
In particular, v is convex.

and v(y) = sup u(x) - xy .
x>0

(9)

4. The derivative of v satisfies

If ET  0 the derivatives of v and u satisfy

u(0+) =  and v(-) = 0.

5. There exists a solution (Q, R)  Q × D to the dual problem, i.e.

v(y) = VQb,µ

+ y R, ET + (Q).

(12)

6. For any x > 0 there exists an optimal consumption strategy c^  A(x, µ). If (Q, Y Rb) is a solution to the dual problem for y > 0 such that x = -v(y) then

u(x) = inf

and

I(t, ·) =

Obviously the problem is easier to treat if Q contains only measures that are equivalent to P . As in Schied [24] we get additional results in this case:

Corollary 2.6 If Assumption 2.4 and Q = Qe are satisfied and  is strictly convex on Q then the value function u is continuously differentiable, the dual value function v is strictly convex, and for each y > 0 there exist Q  Q and R  D such that

v(y) = VQb,µ

Y Rb Z Qb

+ y R, ET + (Q).

Moreover, Y Rb is unique. For any x > 0, the optimal solution c^  A(x, µ) is P -a.s. unique.

(The condition of strict convexity for  is crucial for the differentiability of u.)

The following example considers the case of uncertain drift in a Black-Scholes model. Here one can see the advantage of a penalty function - if we used a purely robust approach the least absolute drift would always give the optimum but when a penalty is introduced the result is dependent on the drift under the measure P . For simplicity we consider a complete market. For computations in a more complex setting considerable additional effort is needed (compare e.g. [13]). Therefore we will treat these problems later. Nevertheless, we will then need the results from duality theory which we developed in this paper.

Example 2.7 We consider a Black-Scholes model, i.e. S is given through dSt = St(btdt + dWt) for constant  > 0 and As penalty function we take the relative entropy between Q and P and we look at the non time-dependent utility functional U (t, x) = log(x). If we do not restrict the market, we do not need to consider different processes Y R, R  D but only

Yt = exp -

(Compare [15, Proposition 4.1]). The convex conjugate of U is given by V (t, y) = -1 - log(y).

Which yields that the optimal ~b is given by ~b = 2b/(T + 2). Obviously the drift that gives the

infimum depends on the original drift b.

3 Dual Problem

We now develop the dual problem. The general approach is to use the capital constraint to bound

the result of the primal problem from above which gives a related minimization problem. Karatzas and Zitkovi´c prove (Proposition 2.13 in [15]) that the capital constraint (1) can equivalently be

formulated as follows, using the set D introduced above. The set A(x, µ) of admissible consumption

rates consists of all processes c such that (Ct :=

is

a

for all R  D.

(13)

With the help of this characterization we can justify our dual problem by the next calculation. Due

to (13) we have for all y > 0 and all R  D

When considering the inner problem we could also define

where DQ is the weak*-closure of the set of supermartingale measures equivalent to Q in (L(P )) and Y R,Q is again defined as a version of the density process of the regular part of R but here with

respect to Q. Obviously DQ can be empty if the market given by the measure Q admits arbitrage.

In this case we set the infimum to infinity. With the help of the functions (v~Q)QQ we can define

an alternative dual function v~:

v~(y)

(v~Q(y)

.

Schied defines his dual problem in [24] in this way. In contrast to our setting he is able to show

that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the two kinds of dual sets [24, Lemma 4.2]. In

our case no similar result holds, i.e. there is no way to decide whether R belongs to D based on

the knowledge of cDQ. This is due to the random endowment. Nevertheless, we can still show that

v(y) = v~(y) for all y > 0. If we define the dual problem via the function v~ there are cases where

the infima are not attained in contrast to assertion 5 of Theorem 2.5. This will be illustrated by

the example below.

Example 3.2
In this example we will have a unique solution (R, Q) to the dual problem for which R  DQb. We consider all convex combinations of two measures Q and P , i.e. Q = {Q = P + (1 - )Q|0    1}. The penalty function is given by (Q) = n, and (Q) =  for all Q  Q. Under

11

P , S0 = 10 and ST takes the values 5 and 15 each with probability 0.5. Under Q, S0 = 10 and ST = 5 Q-a.s. In order to achieve a continuous time model we set St = S0 for all t < T. Obviously Q  P . Assume that ET = mI{ST =5}, µ = T and U (t, x) = -e-x. Hence, V (t, y) equals y(ln y - 1) for y  1 and -1 otherwise. Observe that D contains all measures R that satisfy

 := R[ST = 5]  0.5 and DQ contains only Q. Then

We want to compute v(1), hence we get different situations for  < 1 - /2 and   1 - /2. First we compute the infima for the case  < 1 - /2. Here we need to consider

If we choose m = 1 and n = 2 both derivatives are positive and therefore the infimum for this

case is reached for  = 0 and  = 1/2, and takes the value 1/2(ln 1/2 - 1) + 1/2 < 0. In the case

For the first inequality we used the fact that x ln x  -e-1. Hence, the solution to the dual problem is given by the first case, and equals (Q0, P ) = (Q, P ).
Obviously P  DQ.

12

In the rest of this section we will prove that in contrast to the example the solution to our dual problem exists, and that v equals v~. First we observe that for Q0  Qe of Assumption 2.4 [15, Theorem 3.10] guarantees that vQ0(y) <  for all y > 0 and consequently also v(y) <  for all y > 0.We will repeatedly make use of a version of Komlo´s principle of convergence, compare e.g. [6, Lemma A1.1]. To control the behavior of the penalty function we will need the following lemma, which is taken from Schied [24, Lemma 4.1].
Lemma 3.3 For d  0 denote the subsets of Z corresponding to

We will need the following technical result. Lemma 3.4 For each constant d > 0 the set,

Proof. Proposition 3.5 in [15] guarantees the existence of a utility function U such that U (x) 

U (t, x) for all x > 0 and all t  [0, T ]. Furthermore, the convex conjugate V to U satisfies V (·) 

V (t, ·) for all 0  t  T . Since Z(d) is uniformly integrable (according to Lemma 3.3 and the

Dunford-Pettis theorem) the claim follows immediately if V is bounded from below. Assume V is

not bounded from below. Let  denote the inverse function of -V and y0 = (0). Then it follows that

Since ET  0 it follows that d := 1 + lim supn (Zn) <  and we may assume that Zn  Z(d) for all n.

Now we want to construct a sequence converging to the optimal (Z, R). For this we apply

repeatedly a Koml´os-type argument. Observe that in our case convex combinations of a converging sequence are still convergent. First we obtain a sequence (Z~n, R~n)n of convex combinations of (Zn, Rn)n, i.e. (Z~n, R~n)  conv{(Zn, Rn), (Zn+1, Rn+1), . . .}, where Z~n converges P - a.s. to

some Z  Z(d) (compare Lemma 3.3). To get also convergence for the processes (Zt)0tT and

(YtRn)0tT we will argue analogously to the proof of Proposition A.2 in [15]. Due to [8, Lemma 5.2] we can choose a sequence of convex combinations ((Ztn)0tT , (YtRbn )0tT ) of elements in ((Z~tm)0tT ), (YtR~m)0tT )mn that Fatou-converges to some RCLL supermartingale (Zt)0tT .

Due to Lemma 3.3 and the fact that µ is diffuse on [0, T ) we can find a subsequence that converges

also P  µ-a.s. to (Zt)0tT . We know that Z~ = ZT  Z(d) hence (Zt)0tT is a density process. To get similarly Y Rb we first extract a subsequence of (Rn, Zn)n also denoted by (R~n, Z~n)n such that Rn, ET converges in R. Then we consider the corresponding series (Y Rbn)nN. We have a sequence (Y~ Rbn)nN of convex combinations of (Y Rbn) converging P  µ - a.s. to some Y Rb where R

is a weak* cluster point of Rn  D.

For Z  Z(d), R  D the function (Z, Y R)  E Z

T 0

V

(t,

YtR/Zt)µ(dt)

is lower semicon-

tinuous with respect to P -a.s. convergence. This can be proved the same way as Lemma 3.7 in

[25] using Lemma 3.4. Combining this lower semicontinuity with Lemma 3.3 and the fact that

(x, y)  xV (t, y/x) is a convex function, results in

This proves the optimality of (Z, R).

We will now show that we may replace the set Q in the dual problem by Qe as well as Qef , and that the dual functions are equal. (Where Qfe denotes the set of measures Q  Qe where uQ(x) is
finite for some x > 0.)

This yields together with Lemma 3.3 that   (Z) is continuous2. The functional   R, ET is linear and bounded and hence continuous. Consequently, the function

4 Proofs for the primal problem

In this section we will prove the missing assertions. First we make some easy observations. Due to (13) we know that for all   [0, 1] we have

A(x1, µ) + (1 - )A(x2, µ)  A(x1 + (1 - )x2, µ).

Furthermore, if Assumption 2.4 is satisfied it is easy to show that, under the convention (5), c  UQ(c) is a concave functional on A(x, µ) for each Q  Q and all x > 0. These facts yield the concavity of the value functions uQ and u and therefore under Assumption 2.4 the finiteness of the value function u(x) for all x > 0. The concavity of uQ implies in turn that

T

uQ  + as soon as EQ

U +(t, ct) µ(dt)

= + for some c 

A(x, µ). (16)

x>0

Indeed, if EQ[

it

that

EQ[

Thus, uQ(x + 1) = +.

As uQ is concave this implies uQ  +.

Lemma 4.1

We have the following minimax identity.

u(x) = sup inf
cA(x,µ) QQ

UQ(c) + (Q)

= inf
QQ

uQ(x) + (Q)

= sup inf UQ(c) + (Q) = inf uQ(x) + (Q) .

cA(x,µ) QQe

QQe

Hence, assertion 2 of Theorem 2.5 is valid.

Proof. Let   (0, 1). Proposition 3.5 in [15] gives the existence of a utility function U such that U (x)  U (t, x) for all x > 0 and all t  [0, T ]. With the help of this utility function we define d = 1 + u(x + 1) - U ()  0. Then we have

u(x + 1) u(x + )  sup inf
c A(x,µ) QQ

UQ(c + ) + (Q)

= sup inf
c A(x,µ) ZZ(d)

UQ(c + ) + (Z) .

Now U (t, . + ) is bounded from below and thus

TT

Z  E Z U (t, ct + ) µ(dt) = sup E Z

U (t, ct + ) µ(dt)  n

is a weakly lower semicontinuous affine functional. Lemma 3.3 states that Z  (Z) is weakly lower

semi-continuous and Z(d) is a weakly compact and convex set. Furthermore, for each Z  Z(d)

17

c  UZ(c) is a concave functional defined on the convex set A(x, µ). Therefore we may use the lopsided minimax theorem [1] to obtain

sup min UZ(c + ) + (Z) = min sup UZ(c + ) + (Z) .

cA(x,µ) ZZ(d)

ZZ(d) cA(x,µ)

We know that these expressions are bounded by u(x + ) < d + U ()  0. Thus, it does not matter whether we take the infimum over Z or over Z(d). We obtain

u(x + )  inf sup
ZZ cA(x,µ)

UZ(c + ) + (Z)

 inf sup
ZZ cA(x,µ)

UZ(c) + (Z)

 sup inf
cA(x,µ) ZZ

UZ(c) + (Z)

As   0 the assertion follows since u is continuous.

(17) (18) (19)

Observe now that Theorem 3.10 in [15] states that uQ(x) = infy>0(vQ(y) + xy) for all Q  Qfe . Pooling our lemmas and using this result, we get

u(x) = inf (uQ(x) + (Q)) = inf (uQ(x) + (Q))

Proof. Let (cn) be a maximizing sequence. Using again a Koml´os-type argument we get a sequence

(c~n)nN with c~n  conv(cn, cn+1, . . .) converging P  µ-a.s. to some c  A(x, µ) since A(x, µ) is

closed under convergence in probability. The following adaption of the argument in [17] shows that

the positive parts of U (t, c~tn) are uniformly integrable with respect to Q  µ for all Q  Qfe .

Assume (U +(t, c~tn))n is not uniformly integrable. Then there is a constant , a subsequence

Lemma 4.3 The dual value function v is lower semicontinuous.

Proof.

Define v(0) =

let

supn v(yn) < . We proved that we have Rn  D and Zn  Z such that

v(yn) = VZbn,µ

yn Y Rbn Zn

And with an estimate similar to (15) and ET  0 we know that v(yn)

(Zn). Since  is bounded from below we get that V (., yn) <  Qn  µ-a.s., where dQn =

Koml´os-type argument to get a sequence of convex combinations, ((R~n, Z~n))n where (R~n, Z~n) 

conv{(Rn, Zn), (Rn+1, Zn+1), . . .}, which converges P -a.s. to some (R, Z). Now we use Lemma 3.3

v(yn),

which is the desired lower semicontinuity.

Proof of Theorem 2.5. Assertion 2 and 3, the finiteness of u and v, and the concavity of u were already proved. The convexity of v is an immediate consequence of the convexity of (Z, y Y R)  VZ (Y R/Z) + (Z). Furthermore, the lower semicontinuity of v (see Lemma 4.3) implies assertion 3 of Theorem 2.5. Equation (10) follows as in [15, Lemma A.7]. If ET  0 this implies v(-) = 0 which yields by general duality results that u(0) =  which is equation (11). Assertion 5 corresponds to Lemma 3.5. Furthermore, the existence of an optimal c (item 6) is the content of Lemma 4.2.
We will now deal with the existence of a saddle point. Let y > 0 be such that v(y) + yx = u(x), such a y exists due to the behavior of v. Take then a solution (R, Q) to the dual problem for y and let Z be the density of Q with respect to P . Let Z1 be in Zef and define Z = Z1 + (1 - )Z for   (0, 1]. Then vZ(y) + (Z)  v(y) as   0: Let R1 be such that
VZ1 (yY R1 /Z1) + R1, ET = vZ1 (y).

20

Then define R = R1 + (1 - )R. We get

v(y)  vZ(y) + (Z)  VZ (yY R /Z) + R, ET + (Z)   vZ1(y) + (Z1) + (1 - ) v~Zb(y) + (Z)
because of convexity. Observe that the righthand side of the equation goes to v(y) as  goes to 0. Due to the duality relations we have that vZ + xy  uZ and uZ + (Z)  uZb + (Z).
Hence,

u(x) =

v(y) + yx =

The fact that u(-) = 0 follows from (20). Therefore we also have v(0+) = -. To obtain

the strict concavity of the function u (and hence the differentiability of v) assume that u is not

strictly concave. Since u is increasing and because of the conditions for the derivatives we know

there exist 0 < x0 < x1 and y > 0 such that v(y) + yx0 = u(x0) and v(y) + yx1 = u(x1). Let c0, c1

be the corresponding optimal consumption processes and (Q, R) the solution to the dual problem.

Then we have ct0 = I(t, yY Rb) = c1t Q-a.s.
